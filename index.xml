			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Thursday, Russia invaded Ukraine, precipitating the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/politics/us-military-ukraine-russia/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest military conflict in Europe</a> since World War II. In response, President Biden has delivered on his promise to impose <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-vows-consequences-russia-stages-full-scale-attack/story?id=83085065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweeping economic sanctions</a> against Russia, after weeks of saying he would institute severe sanctions against the country in such an event.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear at this point what these sanctions will do to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin in his invasion of Ukraine, but the sanctions issued by the U.S., in partnership with its allies, intend to hobble Russia’s economy by restricting its major banks’ ability to conduct business as well as the country’s overall ability to remain competitive in the global marketplace, including in particular its ability to bolster its military. In his address earlier this afternoon, Biden also reaffirmed financial and humanitarian support for Ukraine and promised that U.S. military forces in Eastern Europe would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/us/politics/biden-russia-sanctions-ukraine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defend America’s NATO allies</a>, but he was adamant in saying that American troops would not fight against Russia in Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s still very early in understanding how the U.S. and its allies will respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but one key factor in how the Biden administration charts its path forward will undoubtedly hinge on <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060406.214132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American people’s receptiveness to U.S. involvement</a> in this conflict. And on that point, recent surveys suggest that Americans are leery of U.S. intervention in Ukraine, especially when it comes to sending American troops. This attitude <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-crisis-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t changed much</a> in the past few weeks, either, even as a Russian invasion became more likely. Americans continue to have strongly negative views of Russia and support imposing strict sanctions that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/will-wests-russia-sanctions-anything-damage-deter-putin-ukraine-rcna17301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could damage the Russian economy</a>, but Americans don’t yet seem ready to support direct U.S. military action.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s little doubt that Americans view Russia as a threat, though. Indeed, 71 percent of Americans told <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/4bmkoc0k8o/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> this week that Russia posed a somewhat or serious threat to the U.S., with 41 percent calling Russia an “immediate and serious” threat — higher than for any other country or group the poll asked about. And in the same survey, 52 percent said it was more important for the U.S. to take a “strong stand” against Russia to prevent it from taking over Ukraine, compared with 24 percent who said it was more important to maintain good relations with Russia. On that question, a majority of both Democrats and Republicans prioritized opposing Russia in the Ukraine situation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Americans don’t support the U.S. becoming seriously involved in the conflict and, at this point, strongly prefer sanctions and other forms of nonmilitary action to hurt Russia and help Ukraine. For instance, an <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/americas-role-in-the-russia-and-ukraine-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP-NORC poll</a> from last week found that 52 percent of Americans wanted the U.S. to have a minor role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, compared with only 26 percent who wanted the U.S. to have a major role (although what “major” and “minor” meant here was left open to interpretation). Meanwhile, that Economist/YouGov survey found that 57 percent of Americans felt that imposing economic sanctions on Russia was a good idea, and a sizable plurality of Americans (45 percent) supported giving Ukraine financial aid. But 55 percent thought it was a bad idea to send troops to Ukraine to fight Russians, and a slight plurality (37 percent) said the same of sending U.S. forces to Ukraine for support but not to fight the Russians.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that Americans <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/22/ukraine-russia-polling-donbas-sanctions-gas-hikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have become even more skeptical</a> of putting troops on the ground now than they were earlier this month. Morning Consult conducted polls on <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/08174124/2202035_crosstabs_GEOPOLITICAL_RISK_UKRAINE_RVs_v2_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 7</a> and <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/22150208/2202127_crosstabs_GEOPOLITICAL_RISK_RVs_v2_CC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 19-20</a> in which they asked registered voters if they preferred imposing sanctions on Russia or sending more U.S. troops to Eastern Europe under a variety of scenarios, ranging from a Russian-backed coup establishing a pro-Russian government in Ukraine to a complete Russian occupation. And across four of the five scenarios Morning Consult asked about, American voters prefered imposing sanctions to military action in both polls, except in the event that Russia invades and occupies all of Ukraine. In early February, respondents were more likely to support sending troops than just imposing sanctions, but by last week, Americans were evenly split. This speaks to a broader trend between Morning Consult’s two polls: The share of registered voters who preferred sanctions rose slightly in its second poll while the share who backed sending more U.S troops to the region shrank.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This doesn’t mean that Americans would necessarily oppose a deployment of American military forces to the region, however. Americans were split, after all, on that worst-case scenario in Morning Consult’s latest polling, and more broadly, The Economist/YouGov found that a plurality (44 percent) of Americans thought it was a good idea to send troops to NATO allied countries in Eastern Europe, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Understanding where American views go from here is difficult, but as images from Ukraine take over the news, and as Biden and other U.S. leaders direct the country’s response to Russia’s invasion, it’s possible American views on Ukraine will change. By its very nature, a military action of this scope creates an incredibly volatile situation, which means it’s hard to understand Americans’ attitudes at this point. But as things change, we will be keeping a close watch on what Americans think about the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Who Gets To Be A ‘Real American’ Has Always Been About Exclusion</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When Sen. Mitch McConnell was asked, last month, about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-failure-to-pass-a-voting-rights-bill-fits-a-pattern-of-failing-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the concerns that people of color</a> have about their voting access in the upcoming midterm elections, he <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/mcconnell-responds-uproar-voter-comments-82405797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded by saying</a>: “The concern is misplaced because if you look at the statistics, African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You could say McConnell’s comment and the way it differentiated between African Americans and Americans was just an inartful phrasing or a slip of the tongue. But it comes as Republicans around the U.S. have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed and enacted laws</a> that make it harder for people to vote, especially voters of color and young voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, whatever he personally intended, McConnell’s “slip of the tongue” was no slip at all: Throughout U.S. history, white people and institutions have sought to define American identity in a way that excludes people of color, and language has been an important tool in that effort. McConnell’s comment fits neatly into that history. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a long history of patriotic rhetoric that equates Americanness with whiteness — a tactic that influences the public’s perceptions of American belonging and who gets political or social power, according to research. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Whatever we typically think of as patriotic language often puts borders in place about who counts and who doesn’t count,” said Lisa A. Flores, a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, and political rhetoric researcher. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Some of us are not even real Americans. We’re suspect, right? And our bodies are a problem to the nation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Much of this language can seem innocent enough in that it doesn’t mention race or ethnicity outright. Think <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/only-20-percent-of-voters-are-real-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“real” or “regular” Americans</a>, the “<a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/07/23/what-is-silent-majority-trump-nixon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silent majority</a>,” “<a href="https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/159782" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take our country back</a>” and “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079816/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make America great again</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That kind of coded language has a long history in U.S. politics. Take, for instance, “take back our country.” The phrase was one of the last things former President Donald Trump uttered in his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speech before the Jan. 6 insurrection.</a> “We’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country,” Trump said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Variations of that phrase were also <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/496747/rise-tea-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a favorite of the tea party</a>, which sprang to life in no small part in reaction to the election of the nation’s first Black president. Former KKK leader David Duke <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fULPlGwjJMA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used the phrase</a> while explaining the purpose of 2017’s “Unite the Right” demonstration in Charlottesville, and <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?22755-1/louisiana-gubernatorial-runoff-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his concession speech</a> after losing the race for Louisiana governor in 1991. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pat Buchanan, who ran a race-baiting campaign for president in 1992, ended his <a href="https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/buchanan-culture-war-speech-speech-text/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">address to the Republican National Convention that year</a> by saying, “We must take back our cities, and take back our culture, and take back our country.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">George Wallace, former Alabama governor and presidential candidate, ran on the slogan “Stand Up For America” in the 1960s. The motto couched <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-channels-george-wallace-racial-appeals-64654653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigns marred by</a> racism, pro-segregation sentiments and Wallace’s love of the “the great Anglo-Saxon Southland.” He was elected to the governor’s office four times.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This kind of rhetoric is powerful because it allows racism to play out right in front of people’s faces, according to Jamaal Muwwakkil, a socio-linguist and Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s left unsaid who exactly the country is being taken back from.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It passively establishes a hierarchy of Americans on the status of authenticity,” said Muwwakkil. “It is based on the user and the listener to fill in those gaps that aren’t stated explicitly with what they understand to be more authentic characteristics of American.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Painting nonwhite, urban, non-Christian Americans as “fake,” illegitimate or not-the-standard American implies that these populations are less worthy of political or social representation, the experts I spoke with said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We start to use language and we don’t even recognize we’re doing it. You’ve got good people all over the country who are using [this] language, and not intending to be racist,” Flores said. “And that’s the most important piece, because they may not even know how much [Americans have] bought into white supremacy as individuals and as a nation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Language like this has been used to implicitly signal white voters, Flores said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“One of the ways that our brains sort of makes sense of the world around us is that we’re really good at detecting patterns,” said Efrén O Pérez, a professor of Political Science and Psychology at UCLA. “Anytime you use language in that way, you’re tapping into the various associations that people might have with categories, with certain ideas, with certain values.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Flores and Pérez note, language — political rhetoric in particular — is an effective tool to activate this exclusionary version of American identity. In “White Identity Politics,” Duke University political scientist Ashley E. Jardina argues that white racial grievances have a more powerful effect on political beliefs when white people perceive themselves as under threat. As Michael Tesler, a FiveThirtyEight contributor and professor of political science at the University of California, Irvine, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-rise-of-white-identity-politics-explains-the-fight-over-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>, that’s “one reason why Trump was so effective in his <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trumps-use-of-white-identity-politics-strategic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many appeals</a> to the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-stephen-miller-capitalize-white-america-s-fear-its-racial-ncna1102081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/us/politics/donald-trump-white-identity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/06/21/donald-trump-is-a-symbol-of-white-identity-politics-in-europe-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical threats</a> that they were supposedly facing.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-trumps-racist-appeals-might-be-less-effective-in-2020-than-they-were-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots of research has found</a> that Trump’s racist and racialized rhetoric in 2016 helped him win support from white voters who had “conservative” views on race, including many who had previously cast a ballot for then-President Barack Obama in 2012.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The rhetoric matters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it matters beyond elections. This type of language both flows from and reinforces a belief among some Americans, particularly white Americans, that national identity is defined, in part, by whiteness, research has found. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-01818-003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2005 paper</a> in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, “American = White?,” looked at six separate studies on the subject. Overall, it found that African Americans and Asian Americans were viewed as being less American than white Americans (Latinos and Hispanics were not featured in this study). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s despite the fact that both African Americans and white Americans were perceived as having strong ties to American culture. African Americans were seen as more related to a “foreign” label than white Americans, and Asian Americans were not merely viewed as foreigners, but were more likely to be excluded from the “American” label altogether. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-05814-011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 study</a> from the same journal found that white Americans reported concerns that the group’s long-standing claim of being “All-American,” and the term’s growing precarity, may create a growing opposition to diversity.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Gains for minority groups somehow represent a loss for some groups of white people,” said Juliet Hooker, a professor of Political Science at Brown University.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, political language and law go hand-in-hand, experts said. Where racism flows, discriminatory laws may follow. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The law was used as a way of defining who’s American and who’s not along racial lines,” said Kevin Johnson, professor of public interest law at the University of California, Davis. “We should remember that our discriminatory history of immigration laws tells us a little bit about what we are as a nation, and we should pay attention to that.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This can be seen in the <a href="https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/exhibitions/artifact/h-r-40-naturalization-bill-march-4-1790#:~:text=This%201790%20act%20set%20the,born%20abroad%20to%20U.S.%20citizens." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1790 Naturalization Act</a>, <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/our-history/overview-of-ins-history/early-american-immigration-policies#:~:text=The%20general%20Immigration%20Act%20of,for%20new%20federal%20enforcement%20authorities." target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1882 Immigration Act</a>, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/immigration/chinese-exclusion-act-1882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act</a> or <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-agrees-review-trump-travel-ban-case/story?id=48279061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s 2017 Muslim ban</a>. The law has continuously been used to identify and delegate who can be considered an American or worthy of representation in the U.S. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, of course, it’s no coincidence that McConnell’s comment came in a conversation about elections, where who counts as a “true” American is most clearly and literally at stake. Throughout American history, laws have been enacted to deny people of color the vote and representation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Several policies during the Reconstruction and Jim Crow era limited Black voters’ access to elections using loopholes in the 15th amendment that was supposed to guarantee voting rights for Black men. Poll taxes, literacy tests, felony disenfranchisement laws and intimidation are just some of the many ways that Black voters were shunned from the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ongoing <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jim-crow-republicans-democrats-odds-voting-rights/story?id=77188460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting efforts and recent voting restrictions</a> have been dubbed the “new Jim Crow” because of their disproportionate impact on voters of color. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roughly 20 states have restricted voting access since the 2020 election, following Trump’s false claim of widespread election fraud, the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/voting-reform/state-voting-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brennan Center for Justice reports</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, you can see these perceptions about who’s a “true” American, and the language that surrounds those beliefs, in Trump’s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They have resulted not only in a majority of Republicans believing the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to polls</a>, but in a myriad of efforts to find fraud (none of which have succeeded). But look at where those efforts focused: According to Hooker they targeted, “ multiracial cities and cities with large Black populations.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea, Hooker added, is that Trump and his supporters lost because of people who, in their view, shouldn’t get a say at all, and certainly shouldn’t be able to determine the outcome of a U.S. election.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">If there’s one thing you know about FiveThirtyEight, it’s that we love polls. But, contrary to popular belief, we don’t usually conduct polls ourselves — we just collect and analyze them.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On rare occasions, we will sponsor a poll to better understand, say, &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-debate-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;who performed best in a debate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;why millions of Americans don’t vote&lt;/a&gt;, but we always do so in service of a story we’re reporting, not the horse-race toplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> And all the polls we publish can be found in one place: our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling tracker</a>, which we’ve just revamped in preparation for the 2022 midterm elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few other websites aggregate polls, but in our opinion (completely unbiased, of course), the FiveThirtyEight polling tracker is the best. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, it is comprehensive: It lists virtually every public general-election poll for president, Senate, House and governor, virtually every public presidential primary poll, and virtually every public poll of the president’s and vice president’s approval ratings, other important politicians’ favorability ratings,<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, we just list former President Donald Trump’s, but we may start tracking favorability ratings for other politicians in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> and finally the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a>, or which party voters would support for Congress if the election were held today. (The only polls we exclude are those that fail to meet <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/polls-policy-and-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our criteria for transparency and methodology</a>, which almost all reliable pollsters easily meet.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Second, the polling tracker is powerful: You can filter all those polls by race, state, quality and more to see the ones you’re most interested in. You can also download our entire public database — thousands upon thousands of polls — to play around with the data yourself.</p>



<figure><img width="2340" height="1680" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/projects.fivethirtyeight.com_polls.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/projects.fivethirtyeight.com_polls.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/projects.fivethirtyeight.com_polls.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/projects.fivethirtyeight.com_polls.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Here’s a quick primer to help you get the most out of the new iteration of our polling tracker. As you can see, there are six columns of data for each poll. First are the <strong>dates</strong> when the poll was conducted. By default, the polling tracker orders polls by the last date they were in the field, from newest to oldest. However, you can change this by clicking “Added” under “Sort by Date” in the gray area at the top of the page. This will sort the polls by the date we found and added them to the polling tracker (again, from newest to oldest), which can be useful if you check the page regularly and want to see all the polls that have been added since your last visit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The second column lists the poll’s <strong>sample</strong> — how many and what kind of people were polled. This is important because polls with smaller sample sizes have bigger margins of error, and polls can also yield different results depending on whether they survey adults (“A”), registered voters (“RV”) or likely voters (“LV”).<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, when we don’t know exactly what kind of voters have been surveyed, you’ll see a simple “V” in this column, for “voters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> For more details on how different samples (and other methodological quirks) can affect a poll’s bottom line, check out <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-read-2020-polls-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our guide</a> to being an intelligent consumer of polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The third column lists the <strong>pollster</strong> that conducted the poll, along with (in most cases) a letter grade. That letter grade represents its <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight pollster rating</a> — our assessment of the pollster’s quality based on its historical accuracy and methodology. You can click on the pollster’s name to see its full track record over the years. (If you want to read the poll itself, click on the dates.) When a pollster doesn’t have a letter grade next to its name, it means it doesn’t have a pollster rating — probably because it’s new on the polling scene. And when the pollster’s rating contains a slash (e.g., “A/B”) inside a dotted circle, it means <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/polls-policy-and-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rating is approximate</a>; there just isn’t enough data to give the pollster a more precise rating.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In our forecasts and averages, we consider every scientific poll, no matter how low its pollster rating (though we do give higher-quality polls more weight). But you might be a bit pickier, so the polling tracker gives you the ability to hide lower-quality polls if you want. At the top of the page, you can click and drag the bar under “Filter by Pollster Grade” to filter out polls below a certain grade. (For the purposes of this filter, pollster grades with a slash are rounded up, and pollsters without grades are treated as the equivalent of C+ pollsters.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fourth column contains the poll’s <strong>sponsor</strong>, if any — in other words, who commissioned the poll if not the pollster itself. Sometimes, this is a nonpartisan organization like a media outlet or university. But other times, it’s a partisan actor like a PAC or even a campaign. We’ve marked partisan sponsors with a red, blue or black diamond (hollow for campaigns or official arms of the party, solid for party-affiliated outside groups) to indicate potential bias toward the GOP, Democratic Party or another party, respectively. Take these partisan polls with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grain of salt</a>: They’re often several percentage points too rosy for their party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the fifth column lists the <strong>result</strong> of the poll, and the sixth column lists its <strong>net result</strong>, or margin, for those of us too lazy to do the mental math (hey, no judgment). If you see a black dot next to a candidate’s name here, it means he or she is the incumbent in that race; if you see the word “More” with a little arrow, it means the poll asked about more than two candidates (just click the “More” to reveal the full results). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When you first land on the polling tracker, it shows a <em>lot</em> of poll questions — more than 30,000 if you click the “Show more polls” button at the bottom enough times. (This is not recommended.) But as mentioned, you can filter the polls down to a specific race (for example, only <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate polls</a>), a specific state (for example, only <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls of Nevada</a>) or a specific election (for example, only polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Georgia governor’s race</a>) using the drop-down menus at the top of the page. (Each filter has a specific URL, essentially creating mini polling trackers for each election that you can return to in a single click.) You can also use the search bar to narrow the list down to only polls meeting your own custom criteria, such as polls conducted by a given pollster, paid for by a given sponsor or asking about a given candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The polling tracker lets you do a lot with our huge database of polls, but for some polling nerds, it isn’t enough. Therefore, we also make our data available for download so you can play with it on your own. At the bottom of the polling tracker, you’ll see another drop-down menu that lists all the polling data sets we have available for download, right next to a big ol’ “Download” button. You’ll also see a link to our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/polls-policy-and-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls policy and frequently asked questions</a>, which should be able to answer every question you have about our polling tracker that I haven’t already addressed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The cherry on top is that, in addition to listing every poll in our database, our polling tracker is also a hub for accessing some of our most popular averages that feed off those polls: our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker of President Biden’s approval rating</a>, our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker of Vice President Kamala Harris’s approval rating</a>, our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker of former President Donald Trump’s favorability rating</a> and our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker of generic congressional ballot polls</a>. There are links to these polling averages at the top of the page, of course, but you can also use the drop-down menus to filter down to those specific polls and our charted averages will magically appear. And if you filter down to a specific election and we have a polling average available for that race, it will appear right on this page too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As you can see, we’ve designed the polling tracker to be a one-stop shop for all your polling needs. So, if you plan to follow the polls in 2022 and can bookmark only one website, make it this one.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">No one seems happy about politics these days. A <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/emerging-trends-and-enduring-patterns-in-american-family-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new survey conducted by the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life</a>, which I lead, found that less than half the American public felt optimistic about the country’s future. But there is a fairly stark divide among Americans on this question, with white Americans expressing far more pessimism about our country’s direction than members of other racial groups.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">White evangelicals were the most pessimistic group we surveyed, but I found in follow-up analysis for FiveThirtyEight that there was a notable racial divide among Democrats as well.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes Democratic leaners. Black and white racial demographics includes only respondents who identified as non-Hispanic Black and white, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> More than 6 in 10 Black Democrats (68 percent), and 62 percent of Hispanic Democrats said they were somewhat or very optimistic about the country’s future but white Democrats were much more divided — roughly as many said they felt optimistic (53 percent) as pessimistic (47 percent) about where the United States is headed.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="586" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cox.OPTIMISM-GAP.0223.png" alt="Stacked bar chart showing the share of Democratic and Democrat-leaning Americans who expressed each view about the future of the country, by demographic. 53% of White, non-Hispanic respondents expressed feeling very or somewhat optimistic, while 47% expressed feeling very or somewhat pessimistic. In contrast, 68% of Black, non-Hispanic respondents felt very or somewhat optimistic and 32% felt very or somewhat pessimistic. 62% of Hispanic respondents felt very or somewhat optimistic and 38% felt very or somewhat pessimistic." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cox.OPTIMISM-GAP.0223.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cox.OPTIMISM-GAP.0223.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cox.OPTIMISM-GAP.0223.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Despite feeling somewhat more optimistic overall than Republicans about where the country is headed, Democrats — particularly those who are white and college educated — expressed far higher levels of politically based anxiety than Republicans. What’s odd about this development, though, is that over the past several decades American society has moved to the left. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A greater share of Americans identify as liberals today than at any point in the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388988/political-ideology-steady-conservatives-moderates-tie.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past 30 years or so</a>, according to polling from Gallup, even if they are still significantly outnumbered by self-identified moderates and conservatives. On political issues from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/16/americans-overwhelmingly-say-marijuana-should-be-legal-for-recreational-or-medical-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marijuana legalization</a> to <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/despite-partisan-rancor-despite-partisan-rancor-americans-broadly-support-lgbtq-rights-broadly-support-lgbtq-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ rights</a>, the youngest generation of Americans consistently expresses more liberal positions than the ones preceding it. In fact, in an analysis of 50 years of trend data from the General Social Survey,<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long-running interview survey conducted regularly by the National Opinion Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> sociologist <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/85/4/1009/6458238?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Hout found</a> that the U.S. has primarily moved in a liberal direction. On more than half of the variables included in his analysis, Hout found public opinion moving in a liberal direction, while only 11 percent of measures showed attitudes becoming more conservative, a roughly five to one liberal advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With many once-liberal positions being adopted into the mainstream, such as same-sex marriage, one might expect a feeling of hopefulness among left-leaning voters. So, why is the feeling of doom and gloom so pervasive among many white liberals?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One possible explanation may lie in how white liberals prioritize politics over other types of activities. Certainly, when it comes to religious participation — an activity <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/loneliness-epidemic-how-marriage-religion-and-mobility-explain-the-generation-gap-in-loneliness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly associated</a> with stronger social connections and feelings of personal satisfaction  — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-not-just-young-white-liberals-who-are-leaving-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberals have experienced a precipitous decline</a> over the past few decades. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Gallup data</a>, only 35 percent of liberals belonged to a church or religious congregation in 2020, down from 56 percent in 1998. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Research by my colleague Ryan Streeter also finds that the most politically active among us are <a href="https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2020/03/20/the_lonely_political_crowd_487105.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less engaged in civic and social activities</a>. This group of people leans farther left than the general population. Streeter argues that for some on the left, politics has replaced religious activities and participation in local community efforts. “When our tribal needs are not met in familial and communal association, our ideological associations play a larger role in our lives — and nowhere is ideological community stronger than in politics,” he wrote. But political activism that doesn’t require interacting with others in person and building relationships does not offer the same social return on investment as other types of activism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another possible reason white liberals express political pessimism might have to do with their media diet. Compared to other Americans, white liberals spend much more time consuming political news. Interest in politics <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/07/20/since-trumps-election-increased-attention-to-politics-especially-among-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surged among left-leaning voters</a> after former President Donald Trump’s election in 2016. And a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/24/1-partisanship-and-political-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by the Pew Research Center</a> found that the most liberal Americans, a group that is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/24/appendix-1-typology-group-profiles-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predominantly white</a>, became much more attentive to politics in the wake of Trump’s victory — 67 percent report spending more time following politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Dan Hopkins, a political scientist and University of Pennsylvania and FiveThirtyEight contributor, has argued that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-politics-is-national-because-all-media-is-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationalization of politics</a> has occurred because the media increasingly focuses on national debates. And more than other Democratic-leaning voters, white liberals’ news consumption is strongly skewed toward national politics. Almost four in 10 white liberals report that they follow news about national politics very closely, while only 20 percent say they follow local news as often.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One unfortunate side effect of the hyperfocus on national news is that white liberals sometimes embrace policies that are out-of-step with the communities the policies most affect. For instance, Black and Hispanic Democrats <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more supportive</a> of increasing spending on local policing than white Democrats are. In <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/crime-policing-and-the-racial-divide-on-the-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent poll</a> by the Survey Center on American Life, 71 percent of white liberals said they support cutting funding from police departments and shifting it to social services instead. But Black Americans were more divided. Slightly more than <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/public-places-and-commercial-spaces-how-neighborhood-amenities-foster-trust-and-connection-in-american-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half (53 percent)</a> supported this policy, but 44 percent didn’t. This is not to say that Black and Hispanic Americans don’t think there are problems in how the police treat Black and brown people (<a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-black-americans-police-dd91c883-1b3b-4eba-87e2-726357d108d7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they do</a>), but their feelings on the issue are complex, and they <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/17/21292046/black-people-abolish-defund-dismantle-police-george-floyd-breonna-taylor-black-lives-matter-protest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often support an expanded police presence</a> in their own neighborhoods.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another reason for dispiritedness among white liberals may have to do with the political fights that they engage in. Take the 2020 Senate election in Kentucky. Democratic challenger Amy McGrath raised more than <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2020/12/04/amy-mcgrath-spent-90-million-failed-bid-defeat-mitch-mcconnell/3824451001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$96 million</a> in her bid to oust then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, but in the end, the race was not close — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-kentucky-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McConnell won by nearly 20 percentage points</a>. Beating McConnell, despite <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-a-candidate-in-kentucky-but-can-she-beat-mitch-mcconnell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his tepid approval ratings</a>, was always going to be a long shot, yet many liberals became <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/19/democratic-campaign-donations-spike-after-ruth-bader-ginsburgs-death/5839031002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotionally invested in the race</a>. Perhaps because of the time and energy spent following national politics, a lot of liberal fundraising flows to these <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-actblue-is-trying-to-turn-small-donations-into-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile national campaigns</a> that ultimately have a low probability of success.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not difficult to see how deeper investment in more winnable races might ultimately prove more rewarding.<strong> </strong>This underscores yet another reason why white left-leaning voters may be more pessimistic: How they engage in politics is different from other Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Tufts University, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/political-hobbyists-are-ruining-politics/605212/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued in 2020</a> that college-educated white Americans — a group that has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trended leftward in recent years</a> — tend to engage in politics very differently from Black and Hispanic Americans. In his research, Hersh found that “white people reported spending more time reading, talking, and thinking about politics than black people and Latinos did, but black people and Latinos were twice as likely as white respondents to say that at least some of the time they dedicate to politics is spent volunteering in organizations.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hersh suggested that white, college-educated, left-leaning voters are much more likely to engage in “political hobbyism” than in building coalitions to address social problems. These efforts often require sustained energy and investments, which for many left-leaning hobbyists is likely a less attractive way of participating in politics, though it may prove more effective in the long run.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, consuming so much political news and information warps our perception of the world. Consider that white liberals are far more likely than other Americans to say that politics says a lot about the type of person someone is. <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/socially-distant-how-our-divided-social-networks-explain-our-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2020 survey conducted by the Survey Center on American Life</a> found that 75 percent of white liberals believed that a person’s politics defines who they are, higher than the public overall (64 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This phenomenon may also help explain why the same survey found that white liberals (69 percent) were far more likely than white conservatives (33 percent) to say they would be upset if their child married someone whose views of Trump diverged from their own. Left-leaning singles who are looking for a relationship consistently express <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/24/most-democrats-who-are-looking-for-a-relationship-would-not-consider-dating-a-trump-voter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater reservations</a> about dating across the political divide as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">White liberals are also more likely to argue about politics with strangers. In the same 2020 survey, close to half (44 percent) reported having had a political disagreement with someone they did not know well within the previous 12 months; Americans overall were less likely to quarrel about politics with strangers, with 34 percent reporting they had in the same timeframe. The problem with this, though, is that research shows that thinking the worst about our political opponents makes us miserable. A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study published in 2019</a> said, “People who hold harsher views of their political opposites also tend to report that politics has negative impacts on their lives.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, pessimism about the future isn’t entirely unfounded for liberals. The political balance of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-conservative-6-3-majority-would-reshape-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court has shifted much further to the right</a> during the Trump administration, and the electoral map, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly the Senate</a>, presents ongoing challenges. On the policy front, issues like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/health/climate-anxiety-therapy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change can feel intractable</a>, too, given the political realities of the moment. But political predictions are often wrong. At the start of the 2020 redistricting cycle, for instance, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/04/with-fewer-state-governments-divided-by-party-than-in-years-past-gop-has-edge-in-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many political experts</a> expected <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/23/redistricting-cycle-begin-484510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the GOP to lock in significant gains</a>, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-countless-confusing-sometimes-contradictory-takeaways-of-the-2021-22-redistricting-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this hasn’t materialized so far</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good news for left-leaning voters is that the higher rates of national media consumption may have been largely driven by interest in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/27/attention-to-covid-19-news-increased-slightly-amid-omicron-surge-partisans-differ-in-views-about-the-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news about COVID-19</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/07/20/since-trumps-election-increased-attention-to-politics-especially-among-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a>. With Trump no longer dominating the media landscape, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 case numbers falling</a>, the appetite for national news on the left is likely to change. In fact, <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/articles/americans-attention-to-national-news-lowest-in-four-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new study by the Knight Foundation</a> shows that Democrats are already paying far less attention to national news today than they were just a few months earlier. Taking an interest in politics is an important part of being an engaged citizen, but for liberals, greater participation in local affairs and organizations may ultimately prove more personally rewarding.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">At the height of the pandemic, state officials warned that their governments would need billions of dollars of support to keep their budgets afloat. The federal government responded with huge spending bills, and now states have billions and billions to spend on their politicians’ top priorities — but they’re not all spending the money the same way. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses what states’ spending decisions tell us about partisan divides. They also look at the best way to poll Americans’ satisfaction with their own lives and the direction of the country and delve into public-opinion polling on U.S. involvement in Ukraine.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389375/satisfaction-own-life-five-times-higher.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moment of deep political gloom</a>, having faith in any politician might feel like a dangerous game. But starting with President Biden’s victory in the 2020 election and continuing into his first months in office, polls showed that Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/us/politics/biden-approval-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were starting to feel more hopeful</a>. Vaccinations for COVID-19 <a href="https://qz.com/2100168/the-first-covid-19-vaccine-was-given-one-year-ago-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began to roll out</a> en masse. Case numbers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/05/us/covid-peak-comparison.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started to subside</a>. The first stimulus checks under his administration <a href="https://www.usa.gov/covid-stimulus-checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went out in March</a>, and Biden promised that, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56368328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by July 4</a>, the country would be able to start celebrating its “independence” from the virus. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gimmicky, sure — but Democrats were there for it. A <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/03/11/rel2b-coronavirus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN/SSRS poll</a> conducted in March 2021 found that 82 percent of Democrats had a lot of confidence in Biden’s ability to lead the country out of the pandemic, and 74 percent thought the worst of the pandemic was behind us, <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/01/21/rel1c.-.coronavirus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up from 38 percent</a> in January 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By Biden’s six-month anniversary in office, though, Democrats were starting to feel a lot less certain that Biden could deliver on his big plans and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/20/18631452/joe-biden-2020-presidential-announcement-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promises to return to normalcy</a>. Now, more than a year into his presidency, Biden is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing sliding approval ratings</a> and growing doubt — even among his own supporters — that he can restore the country to where it was pre-pandemic. There was a clear turning point for Democrats, too: the summer of 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, those mere months were a perfect storm for Biden:</p>



<ul><li>He missed his self-imposed July 4 deadline to have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-doubles-vaccine-efforts-missing-july-4th-goal/story?id=78688063">70 percent of Americans vaccinated</a>, and the delta variant of the coronavirus <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2022/omicron-comparison-cases-deaths-hospitalizations/">hospitalized and killed thousands of more Americans</a>.</li><li>His promised withdrawal from Afghanistan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/us/politics/biden-afghanistan-withdrawal.html">was chaotic and much-criticized</a>.</li><li>Inflation and supply-chain issues <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/cpi-report-july-2021.html">worsened</a>, despite officials’ claims <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/investing/inflation-stocks-economy-federal-reserve/index.html">that these issues would be temporary</a>.</li><li>One of Democrats’ big election-reform bills <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-wont-support-sweeping-voting-rights-legislation-now-or-anytime-soon/">failed in Congress</a>.</li><li>And talks of Democrats’ <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/23/sinema-35t-spending-bill-506583">sweeping social spending plan stalled</a>, becoming less certain after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema rejected its price tag.</li></ul>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans, for the most part, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/29/amid-infighting-republicans-unite-bash-joe-bidens-speech/7386489002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had written off</a> Biden as well as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-really-really-dislike-biden-but-its-not-just-about-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Democratic administration</a> well before the summer. But during those months, there was also a noticeable dip in Biden’s approval rating among independents, which sank 12 percentage points between July and September, according to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/23/views-of-biden-and-congressional-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>. Perhaps what’s most striking, though, is that optimism among Biden’s base, Democrats, also started to evaporate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to weekly tracking surveys conducted by YouGov, the president once enjoyed the support of large shares of Democrats. Per a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/lvncclv7qj/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June survey</a>, 53 percent of Democrats classified him as a “very strong” leader. However, that number dropped significantly by early August, when a new <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/gh8y14nnzo/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> survey showed that only 44 percent of Democrats viewed him in the same light. And by mid-September, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/lib6k0abqf/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that number dropped even further, to 37 percent</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It wasn’t just that Democratic voters started to lose confidence in Biden’s strength as a leader, however. During the summer months, YouGov also found that Democrats became less and less likely to believe that he could successfully bring the country together.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Fewer Democrats think Biden can unite the country" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QHhh2/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If we recall how things were a year ago at this time, the vaccines were just being rolled out and there was a tremendous amount of optimism that the end of the pandemic was near,” said <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/political-science/people/faculty-directory/david-hopkins.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Hopkins</a>, a political scientist at Boston College. “That’s the way that the media and Biden portrayed the situation.” But, Hopkins said, the rise of the delta and omicron variants of COVID-19 were an unwelcome surprise that frustrated Americans. “Even though it’s not fair to blame Biden for the mutations of a virus, it does seem that he hasn’t been able to deliver on the ‘better days are ahead’ message he promised everyone a year ago.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Things didn’t improve once fall rolled around, either. In fact, polling suggests that Biden’s standing among all voters — most notably Democrats — got even <em>worse</em><em> </em>as time went on. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By November, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357545/biden-approval-ratings-mostly-underwater.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most polls had</a> Biden’s overall approval rating <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underwater</a>. It wasn’t just that Americans were upset at his handling of the ongoing pandemic or inflation or a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/us/politics/democratic-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stalled legislative agenda</a> — they also became less likely to trust that things would get better under his administration. That lack of satisfaction among Democrats was perhaps most startling, though. According to YouGov, Democrats’ happiness with the new administration continued to fade in the winter months and into this year as well. By January 2022, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-joe-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Pew poll found</a> that Democrats’ confidence in Biden’s ability to handle the pandemic and the economy, as well as other issues like immigration and criminal justice, had fallen substantially since soon after he took office.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The ‘public opinion’ answer is that people aren’t terribly sophisticated about responsibility and blame. If you’re in charge right now and things aren’t going well, things are your fault. I don’t know if voters have a more nuanced view,” said <a href="https://www.jenniferwolak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Wolak</a>, a political scientist at Michigan State University.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Democrats' views about the country's direction are wavering" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xIi4v/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">So why was the summer a turning point for Democrats? The answer isn’t a simple one, and experts warned us that dissatisfaction likely increased little by little as the months passed. But factors like perceptions of the economy had a lot to do with it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The inflation numbers may not have registered with people until later in the year,” Wolak said. “They’re going back to normal more over the summer, traveling more and spending more — that’s when they’re really noticing that all of this demand is pushing the prices up.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, inflation has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been a bugbear</a> for the Biden administration. Inflation is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/10/january-2022-cpi-inflation-rises-7point5percent-over-the-past-year-even-more-than-expected.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at its highest level</a> since 1982, with the cost of products like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/10/new-inflation-data-is-worse-than-expectedheres-what-you-need-to-know.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used vehicles and gas</a> soaring over the past year. But for months last year, Biden’s advisors <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-inflation-temporary-fed-should-do-what-it-deems-necessary-recovery-2021-07-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued that inflation was temporary</a>. Over the previous summer and fall, though, it became clear that it might be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/upshot/jerome-powell-inflation-pivot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more persistent than they had hoped</a>. As a result, consumer sentiment — a metric of how optimistic everyday people feel about the economy — dropped precipitously over the summer.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Consumer confidence was strong — before it fell a lot" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2Yv8l/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">As our colleague Santul Nerkar <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last December</a>, rising inflation is closely tied to drops in presidential approval. In other words, Americans tend to punish presidents when inflation happens — particularly when very visible costs, like gas prices and grocery bills, go up. “One thing that we know very predictably about presidents is that their approval rating is tied to general perceptions of the performance of the national economy and the conditions of the country more generally,” Hopkins said. “If people think we’re in good times, then the president benefits — whether or not the president actually has anything to do with it.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And although pessimism about the economy these days is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-pessimistic-views-on-the-economy-have-little-to-do-with-the-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often tied more to partisanship</a> than actual economic conditions, Republicans weren’t the only ones <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/23/national-economic-ratings-and-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressing concern</a>. YouGov tracking surveys found that even Democrats were feeling more and more anxious, with a shrinking share — particularly over the summer months — saying the economy was getting better and a growing share saying that the economy was getting worse. And experts warned us that those <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-and-republicans-get-wrong-about-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">views of the economy are unlikely to improve</a> unless inflation starts to fall.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Democrats are less optimistic about the economy" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WIk4V/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not just the economy that has Americans worried. Issues such as the ongoing pandemic and numerous failed campaign promises — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-failed-voting-rights-push-is-a-setback-for-democracy-and-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting rights</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/year-george-floyds-killing-congress-agree-police-reform/story?id=80188065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police reform</a> and an <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2021/12/19/scoop-manchin-refused-a-call-from-wh-before-killing-bbb-495521" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded social safety net</a> — have also impacted Biden’s standing among Democrats. According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/views-on-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a>, concern about the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans remained high from July 2021 and into this year; however, this polling suggests those fears increased among Democrats during the delta wave in summer and, again, during the omicron wave in winter. Watching the situation break down in Afghanistan <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-end-of-the-afghanistan-war-and-bidens-handling-of-it-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely played a role</a> in Biden’s standing with voters, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/13/how-bidens-definition-bipartisanship-has-quickly-evolved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned on restoring bipartisanship in America</a> and now, as president, was struggling to deliver — and some Democrats appeared to be souring on him as a result. “Biden sold himself as a pragmatist. His appeal was not one of personal charisma and personal inspiration. He sold himself as the guy who could get the job done that you needed to get done,” Hopkins said. At least for Democratic voters, the first job was defeating Trump, he said, but beyond that, “[Biden] was the guy who knew how to work the system and knew how to work with Congress and how to manage the government, even if he wasn’t someone who was personally inspirational.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A decent amount of Biden’s current predicament is not unique to him, however. Many presidents come in with high expectations they <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/cruel-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t realistically meet</a>, and Biden was facing an especially big challenge <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/26/1068063536/biden-struggles-with-his-image-as-covid-19-proves-difficult-to-stay-ahead-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the pandemic</a>. There are probably things he could have done better — <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rising-cases-omicron-highlight-holes-bidens-covid-strategy-experts-say-2021-12-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experts have criticized</a> his administration’s response to COVID-19, and members of his own team <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-12-17/kamala-harris-in-interview-says-administration-did-not-anticipate-omicron-variant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have admitted they were surprised</a> by the rise of new variants — but the course of the pandemic was always going to be unpredictable, and much of what’s happening is out of his control. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, a more realistic message — something along the lines of “Hey, this pandemic will probably be around for a while regardless of what we do, and it might keep wreaking havoc on our economy, too” — wasn’t likely to endear Biden to Americans both desperate for both a return to life before the COVID-19 pandemic and eager to get former President Donald Trump out of office. Biden may have made things worse for himself by promising to work across the aisle, which was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bipartisanship-in-the-senate-is-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always going to be an uphill battle</a>. Mostly, though, Biden’s current political morass may have been exactly what he signed up for when he took the helm of the country during a global pandemic. To dispel the gloom that’s enveloping some of his supporters, he’ll have to make people feel better about the pandemic and the economy as well as fulfill more campaign promises — which, as the past year has shown, turns out to be <em>much</em> easier said than done.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Biden is just facing a dilemma that has bedeviled pretty much everyone who came before him, especially when you happen to be in office when times are rough and the demands can’t easily be satisfied,” Hopkins told us. “In principle, it would be nice if we kind of, you know, reset ourselves closer to reality. But I wouldn’t expect any president to try to do that, because all they might do is just further disappoint people.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The idea that Americans are tired of the pandemic has become conventional wisdom, with important policy implications. Democratic governors in blue states like New Jersey and California have <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/2/11/22904377/democrat-governors-pandemic-mask-mandates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled back mask mandates</a>, citing the importance of “normalcy.” But is “normal” what Americans really expect? And what does “normal” even mean, anyway?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_013122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent Monmouth University poll</a> found that 70 percent of Americans agreed with the statement, “It’s time we accept that Covid is here to stay and we just need to get on with our lives.” This poll got a lot of attention — it was featured in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/us/politics/covid-restrictions-americans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a><em>, </em><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/592102-large-majority-say-its-time-to-just-accept-covid-19-as-part-of-life-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill</a> and other outlets, and was even discussed in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-americans-exhaustion-with-covid-19-is-shaping-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent episode of FiveThirtyEight’s Politics podcast</a>. It’s not an outlier, either. <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Tables-Wave-103.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Feb. 11-13 poll from Harris</a> found that 71 percent of Americans agreed with the statement, “We will be living with COVID in some form forever.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, most Americans believe COVID-19 will persist into the near (or distant) future, but what that means to people’s daily lives is the subject of much more dissent. That’s because understanding COVID-19 as an ongoing reality means something different to everyone. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For some, it means going back to pre-pandemic life, without mask mandates, vaccine requirements or other public health measures to contain the spread of the virus. But that’s not what it means to most, according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Feb. 4-7 Axios/Ipsos poll</a>, in which just 21 percent of Americans said we should “get back to life as usual with no coronavirus mandates or requirements.” To be sure, 29 percent thought we should move toward that goal with some precautions, while 23 percent wanted to mostly keep precautions in place and 21 percent wanted to increase precautions. Part of the reason opinion is so divided is that Americans are simultaneously ready <em>and</em> not-ready to go back to pre-pandemic life. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vtm70v61hq/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over three-quarters of Americans</a> said they were “ready to return to normal”, according to a Feb. 12-15 poll from The Economist/YouGov. And yet the Axios/Ipsos poll showed that <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-02/Topline_Axios_Ipsos%20W62%20FINAL_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent thought</a> doing so posed a large or moderate risk.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What Americans want regarding COVID-19 is all over the place. And there’s only so much the polls can tell you. For instance, they can’t list <em>every</em> public health response to COVID-19, much less every combination of responses. But polls show that support is shifting more toward individual precautions than toward COVID-19 protections mandated for society at large.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Americans seem to be OK with being more cautious in their personal decisions. That is, they’re more willing to undergo measures like mask-wearing or vaccinations for themselves, though they may not want to institute it as a requirement. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/09/increasing-public-criticism-confusion-over-covid-19-response-in-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Jan. 24-30 poll</a> from the Pew Research Center, 73 percent of Americans were fully vaccinated, but just 58 percent supported requiring proof of vaccination to fly. And Americans were even less supportive of requiring vaccines for the four other activities Pew asked about — attending a sporting event or concert (53 percent), going to college in-person (52 percent), eating inside a restaurant (46 percent) and shopping inside a store (40 percent). In fact, overall support for vaccine mandates may be declining. Americans were 3 to 5 percentage points more supportive of requiring vaccines for these activities when Pew polled about this in August 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for mask mandates is mixed. In the aforementioned Harris poll, 55 percent of Americans <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Tables-Wave-103.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly or somewhat agreed</a> that it was time to lift indoor mask mandates. But the Monmouth poll found that 52 percent supported statewide mask and social-distancing guidelines, though this figure is down from 55 percent in December and from 63 percent in September. Likewise, according to Axios/Ipsos, support for local and statewide mask mandates in all public places <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-02/Topline_Axios_Ipsos%20W62%20FINAL_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to fluctuate inside a somewhat narrow range</a> of 60 percent to 67 percent, with the greatest support roughly correlated to the peaks of the delta and omicron waves. But one thing is clear: Even if Americans <em>are</em> backing mask mandates less, most still say they would wear a mask indoors. The Harris poll also found that 69 percent of Americans were at least somewhat likely to keep wearing masks indoors now that indoor mask mandates were being lifted, and for those living in places with mask mandates, 58 percent said they would continue to occasionally mask up once those requirements were removed, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vtm70v61hq/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to The Economist/YouGov</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason support for vaccine and mask mandates may be falling is that the public simply doesn’t trust the government to handle the pandemic correctly. Approval ratings for hospitals’ and medical centers’ responses to COVID-19 were still very high, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/09/increasing-public-criticism-confusion-over-covid-19-response-in-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Pew</a>, but approval ratings for President Biden, public health officials and elected officials in state and local governments all declined by double digits since March 2020. In fact, Pew found a significant decline in the approval rating for state elected officials, from a high of 70 percent in March 2020 to a low of 46 percent in January 2022. This may be why governors in particular are pushing for a return to normal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pew also found that shifting public health guidelines have led to an increasing share of Americans who feel confused or less confident in public officials’ recommendations. They also just <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996331692/poll-finds-public-health-has-a-trust-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust public health officials less</a> than they used to. After almost two years of dealing with the pandemic, Americans may trust their own decision-making more than guidance from the government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gone, too, are the days of declaring a “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/biden-declares-war-on-covid-t7n5r3hgm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-scale wartime effort</a>” until the virus is “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-covid-fourth-of-july/2021/07/04/13afcc66-dcc2-11eb-9f54-7eee10b5fcd2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanquished</a>.” Instead, there’s more acceptance among Americans that the pandemic is probably here to stay in some form. What this means, though, has been the subject of so much debate that it’s unsurprising that so many Americans are uncertain about what actions should be taken on a broader scale to address the pandemic. Regulating their individual actions — and expressing their discontent — may really be the only thing under their control.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The COVID-19 pandemic has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/great-resignation-may-be-altering-workforce-dynamic-for-good.html">reshaped the workforce</a>, with many workers quitting their jobs to seek other opportunities, but Americans still think employers have the upper hand. According to a Feb. 5-8 poll from The Economist/YouGov, Americans thought that employers had “a great deal” or “a lot” of <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/02/15/who-do-americans-think-has-more-leverage">leverage in the labor market</a> (43 percent), versus workers (20 percent) — even though many Americans (47 percent) believed the pandemic increased the bargaining power of workers. (Another 34 percent said it had no effect and 18 percent said that it increased the power of employers.)</li><li>Health care workers <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/16/health-care-workers-pandemic-response-polling/">give themselves, their coworkers, their employers and hospitals high marks</a> when evaluating their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Jan. 31-Feb. 11 Morning Consult/Axios poll. Eighty-nine percent said they strongly or somewhat approved of how health care workers had handled the pandemic, compared with 83 percent for their coworkers, 79 percent for employers and 78 percent for hospitals. But similar to other Americans, health care workers were dissatisfied with how the pandemic was handled by the Biden administration (just 44 percent approved) and the American public (34 percent approved).</li><li>More Americans are growing dissatisfied with current levels of immigration in the U.S., but that’s because Republican dissatisfaction <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389708/dissatisfaction-immigration-level-rises.aspx">hit a record high of 87 percent</a>, an increase of 32 percentage points from last year, according to a Jan. 3-16 poll from Gallup. That large spike among Republicans is to be expected — immigration is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/">an increasingly partisan issue</a>, and the GOP tends to disagree with how Democratic presidents handle the issue.</li><li>There were also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/02/16/publics-top-priority-for-2022-strengthening-the-nations-economy/">sharp partisan divides</a> surrounding what Americans believe the federal government’s biggest priorities for 2022 should be, according to a Jan. 10-17 survey from the Pew Research Center. The greatest differences were in dealing with climate change (65 percent of Democrats cited this as a top priority, versus 11 percent of Republicans) and COVID-19 (80 percent for Democrats, 35 percent for Republicans). But Americans of all political stripes viewed strengthening the economy as the most important issue overall, with 71 percent saying it should be a top priority (although that is a decline of 9 percentage points from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/01/28/economy-and-covid-19-top-the-publics-policy-agenda-for-2021/">last year</a>).</li><li>Overwhelming majorities of Republicans want a presidential candidate <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-republicans-disloyalty-opinion-poll-02-2022/">who shares former President Trump’s views</a> on policy issues (84 percent), the COVID-19 vaccine (78 percent) and the 2020 election (70 percent), according to a Feb. 8-11 poll from CBS News/YouGov. But their opinion on Trump’s personal conduct is more mixed. Just 54 percent said they want someone who comports themselves similarly to Trump. That said, Republicans still favor Trump running again: 69 percent said he should run again in 2024, with 70 percent of that group saying he would be the best Republican candidate.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">In recent months, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60201752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news reports</a> in the U.K. revealed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson attended parties in government buildings while Britain was in strict COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. His approval rating has now sunk to <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/boris-johnson-approval-rating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 percent</a>, and it’s unclear if he’ll hang on to his leadership position. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politics podcast</a>, two hosts of the British “<a href="https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talking Politics</a>” podcast, <a href="https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/Staff_and_Students/professor-david-runciman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Runciman</a> and <a href="https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/Staff_and_Students/dr-helen-thompson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helen Thompson</a>, discuss why the British public and some members of the Conservative Party have soured on Johnson in a way that American Republicans never soured on President Trump, despite Trump’s numerous scandals. They also reflect on how British and American politics changed during the period when Brexit and Trump dominated the two countries’ news cycles and consider their lasting impact.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The aftermath of the 2020 presidential election was probably most Americans’ introduction to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state who rebuffed then-President Donald Trump’s entreaties to “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/trump-demands-georgia-elections-official-overturn-his-defeat-in-hourlong-call/6MRGK445JNAGHBL2HXLZ3FIVZU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find 11,780 votes</a>” that would allow him to carry the state. Same with Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/08/texas-ken-paxton-election-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a baseless lawsuit</a> to get the Supreme Court to throw out 60 of then-President-elect Biden’s electoral votes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Secretaries of state and state attorneys general have <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2016/10/how-to-rig-election-2016-secretary-of.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always been influential</a> within <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2014/10/ag-order-2014-race-ratings-for-attorney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their own states</a>, but the attempted abuse of these offices to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election has finally awakened the rest of the country to their importance. As a result, campaigns for these offices that flew under the radar in 2014 (when Paxton was first elected) and 2018 (when Raffensperger was) have been thrust into the national spotlight here in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, 27 secretaries of state and 30 attorneys general will be elected nationwide (other states either elect them in other years or don’t elect them at all). And since the secretaries of state and attorneys general who are elected in 2022 will wield power in 2024, this year’s elections could plunge our democracy into further danger if would-be election subverters win them.</p>



<h2><strong>Secretary of state</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the ones who oversee the administration of elections and the certification of results in most states, secretaries of state play a fundamental role in our democracy. And given their discretion to interpret and implement election laws in ways that either make it <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-93094-529536--,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easier</a> or <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2018/10/19/georgia-voter-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder</a> to vote, they’ve already drawn a lot of attention for 2022: Candidates for the office are raising <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/candidates-top-election-posts-fundraising-record-setting-pace/story?id=82199309" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record sums of money</a>, Trump has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personally pushed</a> to install loyalists in three key states, and incumbents who otherwise might have sailed to an uncontroversial reelection are now facing rabid primary challenges.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The list of secretary of state elections to watch starts with <strong>Georgia</strong>, where Raffensperger first faces a tough primary from Rep. Jody Hice. While Raffensperger has made it clear there was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/weve-found-systemic-fraud-overturn-election-georgia-secretary/story?id=74560956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no election fraud in Georgia</a> and that Biden won the state, his challenger Hice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted against the certification</a> of the 2020 election in the House. He also continued to baselessly claim that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/politics/jody-hice-georgia-elections-secretary-of-state-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of thousands of potentially fraudulent votes</a> were cast and that Trump, in fact, carried Georgia. (He didn’t.) Hice isn’t the only election denier in the race, though: Former Alpharetta Mayor David Belle Isle has claimed there were “<a href="https://www.thegeorgiavirtue.com/2022-georgia-election/sos-candidate-launches-video-series-to-look-at-2020-election-irregularities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irregularities</a>” in the 2020 election, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s still early, but Hice looks like the primary front-runner. Through the end of January, he has <a href="http://capitol-beat.org/2022/02/hice-nguyen-leading-battle-for-bucks-in-race-for-georgia-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $1.6 million</a> to Raffensperger’s $597,000 and Belle Isle’s $376,000, and he has the golden ticket in any GOP nomination fight: <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/hice-launches-challenge-to-raffensperger-in-race-for-secretary-of-state/IBLOYKCCNFBOTN5FCSEM5PMBAA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>. But his path to the secretary of state’s office is not clear in this newly minted swing state. Whichever Republican emerges from the primary will then face a tough general election against the well-funded ($1.1 million raised so far) Democratic state Rep. Bee Nguyen in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump and his allies aren’t just targeting their fellow Republicans, though. Democratic secretaries of state who spent the 2020 election cycle expanding voting access are in the crosshairs, too. The most vulnerable Democrat is likely Jocelyn Benson of <strong>Michigan</strong>. And unlike in most states, her Republican challenger will be chosen at a <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/16/michigan-gop-sets-early-convention-declines-vote-hand-count/8149133002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party convention</a>, not a primary, which could lead to a more radical nominee who appeals to party diehards. That’s good news for college professor Kristina Karamo, who has <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/07/donald-trump-backs-michigan-election-critic-secretary-state/5758348001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Karamo became a right-wing celebrity when she claimed she witnessed fraud as a poll watcher in the 2020 election, and she has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/16/politics/kristina-karamo-michigan-secretary-of-state-candidate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">espoused conspiracy theories</a> such as that Trump actually won Michigan and that the Jan. 6 rioters were actually members of antifa. Other Republicans in the race have more conventional resumes for the state’s chief election official: state Rep. Beau LaFave, Chesterfield Township Clerk Cindy Berry and Plainfield Township Clerk Cathleen Postmus. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans are also hoping to flip control of the <strong>Arizona</strong> secretary of state’s office, but there, Democratic incumbent Katie Hobbs isn’t running for reelection, leaving a crowded field of hopefuls to replace her. Former Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes (who used to oversee elections in Arizona’s most populous county) and state House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding are the two Democratic candidates and the only two candidates in the race who have acknowledged Biden’s victory as legitimate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the four Republicans in the race, meanwhile, two have tried to overturn the 2020 election results. State Rep. Shawnna Bolick, for instance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/backers-trumps-false-fraud-claims-seek-control-next-us-elections-2021-09-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed onto a resolution</a> that urged Congress to award Arizona’s Electoral College votes to Trump, and she also <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/06/22/shawnna-bolick-author-of-bill-to-reject-voters-presidential-choice-running-to-be-top-elections-official/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a bill</a> that would have allowed the legislature to revoke the certification of presidential elections in the state,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill died in committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> although she has argued that she wasn’t part of the “Stop the Steal” movement. Meanwhile, state Rep. Mark Finchem signed onto the same resolution as Bolick and <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/06/02/mark-finchem-was-much-closer-to-the-jan-6-insurrection-than-he-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 insurrection</a>. Finchem, who has <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/09/13/trump-endorses-mark-finchem-arizona-secretary-state-election/8322839002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>, also has ties to the <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-legislators-to-speak-at-qanon-conference-in-las-vegas-11884331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAnon conspiracy theory</a> and has identified as a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republican-state-lawmakers-white-nationalists-rslc-silent_n_5bcd82e4e4b0a8f17eee0a1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member of the Oath Keepers</a>, a far-right anti-government militia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The two other GOP candidates, advertising executive Beau Lane and state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, have <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/blog/ad-agency-exec-beau-lane-joins-gop-primary-for-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined to say</a> whether the 2020 election was illegitimate, but Ugenti-Rita has voted like she thinks it was. She sponsored multiple <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1003/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting</a> <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1485/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictions</a> that passed the legislature last year, and she initially supported an unfounded <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/post-election-audits-are-normal-whats-happening-in-arizona-is-anything-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan audit</a> into the 2020 election results in Maricopa County (although she later <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-gop-ugenti-rita-withdraws-support-audit-calls-botched-2021-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned against it</a>, complaining it had been “botched”). Ugenti-Rita has other baggage as well: A lobbyist has accused her of making <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/02/05/lobbyist-details-harassment-claims-involving-arizona-senator-michelle-ugenti-rita-brian-townsend/4647264002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwanted sexual advances</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Nevada</strong>’s secretary of state post is also open following the retirement of Republican Barbara Cegavske, who was <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2021/04/12/nevada-gop-censures-barbara-cegavske-defending-election-results/7192091002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured by the state GOP</a> for her insistence that the 2020 election was not fraudulent. Trump himself has not yet weighed in on the <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/2020-election-fraud-conspiracy-theories-remain-central-to-many-republican-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP primary here</a>, but if he does, he’ll probably back former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, who wants to conduct an Arizona-style “audit” into Nevada’s results and attended an election-fraud conference put on by businessman and Trump ally Mike Lindell. Another <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/reno-developer-former-state-senator-jesse-haw-to-run-for-secretary-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-funded Republican candidate</a>, former state Sen. Jesse Haw, says on his <a href="https://www.jessehawnv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign website</a> that Nevada’s liberal voting laws “have made it easier to cheat.” However, there is one pro-democracy Republican running: Sparks City Councilman Kristopher Dahir. Dahir has said he does not believe the 2020 election was stolen and has praised Cegavske’s leadership. There’s also a competitive primary on the Democratic side between Cisco Aguilar, a staffer for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and former state Assemblywoman Ellen Spiegel.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are four of the biggest secretary of state races in which democracy is on the line in 2022. But there are a couple of dark-red states where the Republican primary (as the de facto general election) could have huge consequences for democracy as well. The incumbent secretaries of state of both Idaho and Alabama are retiring, and the primaries to replace them have become referenda on the legitimacy of the 2020 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, in <strong>Idaho</strong>, there are three candidates vying to replace outgoing Secretary of State Lawerence Denney. Phil McGrane, who runs elections in Idaho’s biggest county, has said that Idaho’s elections are <a href="https://magicvalley.com/opinion/columnists/malloy-state-s-election-system-is-sound/article_932fc81d-7cc8-5865-b979-77a08af0d689.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally secure</a>. But state Sen. Mary Souza has pointed to “<a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2022/01/24/introducing-each-candidate-who-is-running-secretary-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weaknesses</a>” in Idaho’s election laws, while state Rep. Dorothy Moon last year <a href="https://wendyrogers.org/update-146-legislators-from-38-states-write-a-letter-to-the-american-people-calling-for-a-50-state-audit-decertification-where-appropriate-and-possible-convening-of-the-us-house-of-representatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a letter</a> calling for an “audit” into the election results in all 50 states along with the decertification of the 2020 election if necessary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, the candidates to succeed <strong>Alabama</strong> Secretary of State John Merrill include one experienced election administrator and multiple pro-Trump election deniers. Ed Packard, who worked in the secretary of state’s elections division for more than 24 years, maintains that there is <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/02/spotlight-shines-on-alabama-secretary-of-state-race-as-views-over-2020-election-and-trump-loom-large.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence of widespread voter fraud</a>, whereas state Rep. Wes Allen <a href="https://twitter.com/RepWesAllen/status/1336791872426086403?s=20&amp;t=gy33vMUpIdo2jNAGXdA0UA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> Texas’s lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election and Alabama Auditor Jim Zeigler has said there is “preliminary information” to suggest there were “strange voting returns” in some counties. </p>



<h2><strong>Attorney general</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">They may not be responsible for the administration of elections, but as their states’ “top lawyers,” state attorneys general provide legal advice and representation for government agencies and officials, investigate crimes and otherwise work to ensure that the state’s laws are being enforced. In the past year, this has meant a lot of wading through — and in some cases initiating — claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In total, we’ve identified five attorney general elections in which claims of election fraud have been a significant issue, ranging from Texas, whose <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/texas-sues-georgia-to-try-to-overturn-election-results/EVEDMTX2J5E2DJ3O6FOGMDS7PM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general led the charge</a> to overturn election results, to Wisconsin, where neither Republican candidate has explicitly claimed that Trump won in 2020 but have nonetheless made election fraud a significant part of their platforms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The most controversial state attorney general right now is likely <strong>Texas</strong>’s Ken Paxton, who is mired in election-related disputes as well as two different criminal investigations. As we said at the outset, Texas was at the forefront of attempts to overturn the 2020 election result, in large part thanks to Paxton’s baseless lawsuit to block the results in four states Biden had won. Trump <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/26/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-2022-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Paxton</a> last July, but he’s also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-louie-gohmert-endorse-opponent-texas-attorney-general-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praised Rep. Louie Gohmert</a>, who <a href="https://abc13.com/louie-gohmert-lawsuit-mike-pence-biden-electoral-count/9284409/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed his own lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election</a> and is now challenging Paxton for attorney general. There are two other Republican candidates in this race: George P. Bush, the Texas land commissioner and son of 2016 candidate (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/05/06/477077226/jeb-bush-wont-vote-for-trump-i-cannot-support-his-candidacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/12/jeb-bush-trump-should-stop-tweeting-focus-on-agenda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequent</a> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/26/jeb-bush-warns-trumps-character-may-drag-down-gop-2018-elections/1067795001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/jeb-bush-trump-qanon-praise-dee2dc47-1db1-4d1f-bae9-fa88bff6dd85.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critic</a>) Jeb Bush, and former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Bush is the only candidate to <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/554119-george-p-bush-says-2020-election-wasnt-stolen-but-would-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have rebuffed claims</a> that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump; Guzman hasn’t said anything publicly about it but has said she would welcome <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/21/texas-eva-guzman-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s support</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the scandals Paxton finds himself in — he faces felony charges from <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/06/19/ken-paxton-criminal-case-timeline-texas-attorney-general-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2015 securities fraud case</a> when he was a member of the Texas Legislature and is also the subject of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/criminal-investigations-dallas-ken-paxton-coronavirus-pandemic-crime-3657864db01b3e2525f53f8f523af316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate FBI investigation</a> over allegations that he engaged in bribery and other crimes while attorney general — the most recent polling of the race shows <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/new-poll-shows-tx-ag-paxton-staring-down-runoff-race-abbott-well-ahead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paxton leading the pack, with 47 percent</a> of the vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Kansas</strong>, meanwhile, the attorney general election is wide open after incumbent Derek Schmidt <a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-dwight-eisenhower-kansas-legislation-coronavirus-pandemic-87542690cbd10047f1e557f7eb5ff57f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to run for governor,</a> creating an opening for <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-kansas-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the GOP’s most vocal proponents of election fraud</a>: former Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Notorious for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/19/621304260/judge-tosses-kansas-proof-of-citizenship-voter-law-and-rebukes-sec-of-state-koba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a controversial law</a> he championed as secretary of state that required residents prove their citizenship before registering to vote, Kobach is now mounting his third bid for statewide office despite two previous unsuccessful attempts — he first <a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/political/laura-kelly-topples-kris-kobach-in-kansas-gubernatorial-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in the 2018 gubernatorial race</a> and then lost to <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article244717957.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then-Rep. Roger Marshall in the 2020 Senate GOP primary</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s likely Kobach’s failure to win these recent elections that has attracted competition in this primary, despite his Trump bona fides. (He hasn’t claimed the 2020 election was fraudulent, but <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/12/07/kobach-texas-case-challenges-election-directly-at-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he did write an op-ed in the conservative media outlet Breitbart</a> in support of Paxton’s lawsuit.) Meanwhile, both state Sen. Kellie Warren, who launched her campaign with <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/07/06/kellie-warren-joins-kris-kobach-kansas-attorney-general-race/7872788002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a thinly veiled dig</a> at Kobach, and former prosecutor Tony Mattivi are running against him. Neither Mattivi nor Warren have spoken publicly about whether they dispute the results of the 2020 election, instead focusing more on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-health-senate-elections-election-2020-616fd7663ffd5cfa25b698b7126d98f9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging the Biden administration</a> on issues like vaccine mandates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Idaho</strong>, it’s a question of whether Republican incumbent Lawrence Wasden, who has defended the 2020 election result, will survive a primary challenge. Lawrence broke with <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/529614-18-states-join-texas-case-seeing-to-overturn-biden-win" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a dozen Republican attorneys general</a> when he <a href="https://www.ag.idaho.gov/newsroom/wasden-issues-statement-on-texas-election-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in December 2020</a> that he wouldn’t be joining Texas’s effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election result. That, in turn, precipitated <a href="https://cdapress.com/news/2020/dec/12/coeur-dalene-attorney-art-macomber-considered-atto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a primary challenge</a> from attorney Art Macomber, who said he was inspired to run when Wasden didn’t join the suit; Dennis Boyles, <a href="https://www.idahoednews.org/kevins-blog/wasden-will-seek-re-election-joins-crowded-a-g-s-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another attorney in the state</a>; and <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/11/17/raul-labrador-launches-attorney-general-campaign-appoints-treasurer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Rep. Raúl Labrador</a>, Wasden’s only challenger with any political experience. But all of these challengers likely face a steep climb to the nomination — Wasden is the <a href="https://www.naag.org/attorney-general/lawrence-wasden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longest-serving attorney general</a> in Idaho’s history, having served for nearly 20 years. And with the exception of <a href="https://archive.sos.idaho.gov/ELECT/results/2002/primary/tot_stwd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his first primary in 2002</a>, he’s handily defeated all subsequent opponents by double-digit margins. That said, both Labrador and Macomber <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/12/10/more-than-1-6-million-already-raised-in-idaho-campaigns-for-statewide-offices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have outraised Wasden</a>, which is a favorable sign for their campaigns.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in <strong>Michigan</strong>, it’s another case of a pro-democracy Republican pitted against proponents of the Big Lie in the GOP primary. At this point, however, <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/politics/2022/01/12/poll-dana-nessel-has-edge-in-re-election-bid-for-michigan-ag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling shows</a> incumbent Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel with a small lead over her two main Republican challengers, former Michigan Speaker of the House Tom Leonard and attorney Matt DePerno.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As is true in Michigan’s secretary of state election, GOP convention-goers will <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/09/michigan-gop-plots-shift-statewide-nomination-process-amid-fight-over-future/7915760002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately decide who the nominee</a> is, not primary voters. And if Leonard wins the nomination, the 2022 election will be a rematch of 2018, which Nessel won by just 3 percentage points. He is also the only Republican running who has said <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-attorney-general-nomination-race-could-test-trumps-hold-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there isn’t any evidence</a> that the election results were invalid. DePerno is polling worse against Nessel than Leonard, but it’s close, and his endorsement from <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/16/trump-endorses-michigan-election-challenger-deperno-attorney-general/8371724002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> may sway some delegates. DePerno has also been a vocal proponent of the claim that Trump’s election loss was fraudulent, even <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/07/attorney-accused-of-pushing-false-election-fraud-claims-wants-to-be-michigans-next-attorney-general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filing a lawsuit in Antrim County</a> alleging that the voting machines used in the election were compromised (the suit was ultimately dismissed). Finally, state Rep. Ryan Berman is also running as a Republican who backs the Big Lie — he <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2020/12/10/gop-lawmakers-hide-from-questions-about-trumps-quest-to-overturn-the-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed onto a letter</a> in late 2020 that raised allegations of election fraud and asked for an independent audit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another state that Democrats are defending is <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, where incumbent Democrat Josh Kaul faces two Republican challengers, who haven’t backed the Big Lie but who have still made “election security” a big part of their platforms: Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney and former state Assemblymember Adam Jarchow. Toney, for instance, has tried to build a name for himself as the district attorney who has prosecuted the most cases of election fraud in the state. (Toney has prosecuted <a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-attorney-general-race-could-decide-fate-of-fraud-allegations-against-wisconsin-elections-commissioners/article_0bec141e-2866-5a5d-9f1a-af7cb688172b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven of 10 cases</a>, the most of any Wisconsin district attorney.) Meanwhile, Jarchow <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamforAG/status/1492202669934628873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has attacked Kaul</a> for insufficiently investigating allegations of election fraud, although he hasn’t gone as far as to question the 2020 presidential result. It’s early yet, but at this point both Jarchow and Toney <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/15/adam-jarchow-takes-more-month-than-eric-toney-raised-year/6791141001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are behind Kaul’s</a> fundraising; Kaul had over $1 million ready to spend in his campaign account at the end of December, while Jarchow and Toney have each raised between $80,000 and $100,000.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But of course, these are only some of the highest-profile offices on the ballot in 2022 that could impact the 2024 election. Since it’s still early in the campaign, races for secretary of state and attorney general in other states could become hotly contested over the next few months. And a lot of the nuts and bolts of administering a free and fair election are hammered out on the county level, where there are <a href="https://boltsmag.org/whats-on-the-ballot/local-election-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countless more election officials</a> getting elected this year. So while it’s frighteningly difficult to know how likely it is that the 2024 election will actually get overturned, it’s definitely possible that, after 2022, the pieces will be in place to do so.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When President Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law last March, he funded federal programs designed to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and provided a third round of stimulus to Americans. But the bill also provided $350 billion in aid sent directly to states, counties and local governments to spend as they saw fit. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was an almost unprecedented amount of money. According to an analysis from <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/06/28/how-far-american-rescue-plan-dollars-will-stretch-varies-by-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pew Charitable Trusts</a>, states received aid equivalent to anywhere from 4.9 percent (Wisconsin) to 22.7 percent (Wyoming) of their spending in the previous fiscal year. Most states have a legal obligation to balance their budgets, which means unexpected surpluses like this are rare. But combined with previous coronavirus response bills and spending packages, the federal government has now spent <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/disaster/covid-19?publicLaw=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $5 trillion</a> addressing the pandemic, money that will flow through communities over the next decade and change the funding landscape in states and cities across the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">States are awash with cash.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not clear yet where all this money will go — states have an enormous <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amount of leeway</a> as to how they’ll spend it and until 2026 to do so. (In total, <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/how-states-can-best-use-federal-fiscal-recovery-funds-lessons-from" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$155 billion went out to states</a> in 2021, with the rest due to be distributed later this year.) Most states have used the windfall of cash to address the budget problems caused by the economic downturn following the pandemic and to address the inequities thrown into sharp relief during the past two years. But while there are broad commonalities in how states have spent the money, it’s also true that how relief from the pandemic is defined varies widely — not necessarily across partisan lines but in ways that are still shaped by local conditions and ideology.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These differences are more apparent after drilling down past broad categories of funding. In Oklahoma, for example, Gov. Kevin Stitt <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2021/05/17/unemployment-oklahoma-1200-workers-governor-kevin-stitt-economy/5130077001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended the enhanced unemployment benefits</a> available to many workers during the pandemic, and used some of Oklahoma’s American Rescue Plan money last spring for $1,200 bonuses to the first 20,000 workers who stopped collecting unemployment and started working full time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other states combined back-to-work bonuses with <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMmQ2NDRiNDYtN2NkZC00OTE2LThjYzQtYjAzNTE2ZDRjZWFiIiwidCI6IjM4MmZiOGIwLTRkYzMtNDEwNy04MGJkLTM1OTViMjQzMmZhZSIsImMiOjZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader workforce development packages</a> that included bonus pay for essential workers who’d worked through the pandemic and job retraining programs. Meanwhile, Vermont used <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/ACTS/ACT009/ACT009%20As%20Enacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 million</a> <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/ACTS/ACT009/ACT009%20As%20Enacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of its recovery plan</a> money to provide free classes at state colleges to workers who wanted to change careers, and Washington state used almost $169 million <a href="https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5092-S.PL.pdf?q=20210426164608" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to help pay for its paid leave program</a>. While there are variations from state to state, they will determine the recovery landscape for millions of Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that there is so much federal money flowing doesn’t change local politics, said Ed Lazere of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that has been tracking and analyzing how states are allocating their relief money. “In many cases it is shaped by what the values of the policymakers were beforehand.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, there are broad trends in how states are spending the money: Almost every state that has allocated money so far has spent some on broadband, water and sewer infrastructure, which was one of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big spending categories determined by Congress</a>.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A formula taking into account states’ unemployment rates and lost revenue from lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions determined how much aid states received, whether they received it all at once, and whether they could use it to replace lost tax revenue, and so the stimulus picture looks different in every state. Some states received all of their money at once and have already allocated it all, while a handful of states — South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, Mississippi and South Carolina — are &lt;a href="https://yallpolitics.com/2021/06/15/mississippi-to-receive-1-8-billion-from-the-american-rescue-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;just starting&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2022/01/04/extra-meetings-planned-appropriations-committee-spending-requests-accumulate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;make determinations&lt;/a&gt; on it. (Additionally, another $122 billion went &lt;a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-distribution-all-american-rescue-plan-esser-funds-and-approval-all-52-state-education-agency-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;directly to school districts&lt;/a&gt;, which largely can determine how to spend it themselves. Funding for cities and counties also complicates the picture. A tiny fraction of money allocated to municipalities — less than 0.3 percent of the total funds available, according to a 15-state study from the &lt;a href="https://www.nlc.org/article/2022/01/03/data-finds-small-municipalities-declining-arpa-slfrf-funds-is-rare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National League of Cities&lt;/a&gt; — was declined, but the rejections could have stemmed from logistical reasons rather than ideological ones.)&lt;/p&gt;

Within states, this has meant a mix of new programs, funding for existing programs and expansion of broadband services to more rural areas where the lack of access to reliable, fast internet made it harder for some children to attend virtual school during lockdowns. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Infrastructure has also been a big priority for states like Florida, which is <a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/globalassets/dem/recovery/american-rescue-plan-act/florida-recovery-plan-for-sfrf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending money on highways and other transportation projects</a> that had been long-planned but unfinished. Lazere said some of the need for infrastructure goes all the way back to the Great Recession, which began in 2007, and the long, slow recovery that followed. “These were areas of need that had not been addressed, [for which] there hadn’t been a dedicated state or federal funding source, so the rescue plan gave them the opportunity to tackle these problems that had been around for a long time,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, because the funds are a large, one-time payment, with no expectation that they’ll continue into the future, it encourages spending on infrastructure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It really starts with states doing that analysis, to be able to know what’s affordable over the long-term and what’s not,” said Josh Goodman, who is part of The Pew Charitable Trusts’s state fiscal health project.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But because the categories in which states are allowed to spend the money are so expansive, and the money is given without many strings attached, the kinds of projects states plan to spend the money on also reveals local political priorities and political philosophies. Broadly, states are allowed to replace revenue lost during the pandemic, and how local lawmakers define those challenges and decide how to address them varies widely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Alabama, $400 million will be used for building two new prisons. New correctional facilities for the state had been one of Gov. Kay Ivey’s priorities; <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/01/alabama-gov-kay-ivey-calls-for-gas-tax-new-prisons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/02/alabama-will-build-3-prisons-for-men-ivey-announces-do-not-publish.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she announced plans</a> for three prisons that were ultimately scrapped. But the state has been under a court order to improve mental health care in its prisons <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/documents/the_opinion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2017</a>, and advocates of the new law say using the recovery funds to build a new prison will address those problems, as well as overcrowding and inadequate staffing. They also say the new facilities will improve the overall health care and mental health care available to incarcerated individuals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The proposal passed <a href="https://abc3340.com/news/local/alabama-house-votes-to-use-400-million-from-american-rescue-plan-act-to-build-prisons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a special legislative session in September</a>. In the state House, the vote passed along party lines, with Republicans all in favor and most Democrats against, but in the state Senate it received broader support and only one Democrat voted against it. The House Democrats’ objections, along with criminal justice reform advocates in the state, are that building a new prison absent other reforms won’t solve the criminal justice system’s problems, and that the funds could have been spent on more urgent needs revealed by the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two dozen Alabama groups <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2021/12/21/organizations-challenge-use-of-covid-relief-funds-to-build-prisons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a letter</a> to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee asking for an investigation of Alabama’s use of the funds for building the prisons. “Building more prisons is a gross misuse of funds that were sent to help the people of Alabama, not punish them,” JaTaune Bosby, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, <a href="https://www.aclualabama.org/en/press-releases/alabama-organizations-call-us-house-financial-services-committee-halt-use-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in the letter</a>. But the state has argued the use falls within guidelines, and has plans to move quickly on construction. In a <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/01/31/alabama-2022-legislative-report-first-special-session/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special session last month</a>, the state also moved to allocate most of the rest of the funds to water and sewer infrastructure, broadband, and unemployment insurance tax breaks for businesses.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In more liberal states and localities, lawmakers are pursuing new financial assistance programs for local families. One idea that has picked up steam is funding <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/phoenix-approves-universal-basic-income-program-for-1000-families-12052702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guaranteed</a> <a href="https://iecam.illinois.edu/news/chicago-approves-guaranteed-basic-income-pilot-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">income</a> <a href="https://www.newarknj.gov/news/guaranteed-income-pilot-program-expands-to-400-newark-residents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pilot programs</a>, with eligible residents receiving between $500 and $1,000 in cash assistance monthly. Support for these programs <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-28/the-u-s-cities-giving-residents-direct-cash-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been growing across the ideological spectrum</a>, especially in the last few years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Madeline Neighly, who directs the guaranteed income program at the Economic Security Project, said there are currently over 60 cities involved in planning guaranteed income projects, using a mix of public funds from the American Rescue Plan and private funds. (Some programs were already in the works, and the ARPA funds are just a new potential revenue source.) And the state of California will itself <a href="https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2021/07/universal-basic-income-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend $35 million launching guaranteed income programs</a> statewide over the next five years. The money was allocated when Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/12/california-roars-back-governor-newsom-signs-100-billion-california-comeback-plan-to-accelerate-states-recovery-and-tackle-persistent-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed the state budget into law</a> last summer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Neighly said the previous pandemic relief bills helped build awareness and increased interest in launching such projects. “We saw the power of cash during the pandemic,” she said. “We saw it with the stimulus checks and the expanded child [tax] credit.” She said guaranteed income could work in concert with many of the other programs states are launching to rebuild their economies. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The impact this money will have will become even more apparent as the funds work their way into communities and start touching individual lives. Overall, though, the unprecedented amount of money is an opportunity for states to reimagine and reinvent their local economies, which could mark an important shift after two years of responding to emergencies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Lazere, the biggest takeaway is that states are all using the money, and will continue to do so as the next payments are dispersed this year. So far, no states have rejected the money outright. “What we’re hoping for and looking for is not just states plugging this money into budget holes, but actually deliberately using it to strengthen public health and the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic,” he said. “We are looking for states to use the money in ways that really set them up for a robust recovery.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Feb. 24, 7:52 a.m.):</strong> Russia has now launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. (For the latest developments, follow <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/russia-ukraine/?id=82467772" target="_blank">the ABC News live blog</a>.) Russia’s dramatic escalation of the conflict since we published the article below could shift public opinion around the world, including in the United States. But Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine comes against a backdrop of a U.S. public that is skeptical of American intervention. On Wednesday, <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/americas-role-in-the-russia-and-ukraine-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> released a survey finding that only 26 percent of American adults said the U.S. “should have a major role in the situation”; 52 percent said “minor role,” and 20 percent said “none at all.”</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">For days now, there have been reports that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/russia-ukraine/?id=82467772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia could attack Ukraine at any moment</a>, although it’s possible <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/14/world/russia-ukraine-news#as-russian-forces-menace-ukraine-western-leaders-continue-an-urgent-diplomatic-effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued diplomatic talks</a> could avert military conflict. Russia is <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-possible-invasion-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking concessions</a>, such as a promise from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that Ukraine <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-putin-nato-invasion-demands-rcna9116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will never be allowed to join the coalition and/or</a> reductions in NATO’s <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-urges-de-escalation-as-scholz-visits-moscow-for-putin-talks/6442259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">troop presence and missile deployment</a>. But as <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/03/27/a-brief-history-of-nato-from-truman-to-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the leading nation in NATO</a>, the United States must now grapple with how it will help protect its allies, many of whom are located near Russia, while managing its relationship with Ukraine, which has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/war-with-russia-has-pushed-ukrainians-toward-the-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become closer to the West in recent years</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In light of these challenges, President Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/politics/biden-zelensky-call/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has promised</a> further <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/22/ukraine-russia-military-weapons-nato-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Ukraine</a>, but <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060406.214132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. public opinion may affect</a> just how far his administration is willing to go to aid the beleaguered nation. As with many foreign policy issues, Americans don’t necessarily have well-established views on how the U.S. should respond, and in some cases their attitudes are mixed. For instance, polls suggest Americans would prefer to avoid becoming heavily involved in the conflict, but many support taking Ukraine’s side against the Russians. There is also a significant amount of variation in how and to what degree Americans want to assist Ukraine as well as a number of partisan- and age-related divisions over potential American responses. Those splits might reflect broader views on the country’s role in world affairs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked about the U.S. position in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Americans at first glance prefer to remain above the fray. In a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-u-s-involvement-opinion-poll-02-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov survey</a> conducted last week, 53 percent of Americans said the U.S. should stay out of the situation by siding with neither Ukraine or Russia in ongoing talks, while 43 percent said the U.S. should back Ukraine (only 4 percent wanted to side with Russia). A <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/557651509/20220207-Yahoo-Tabs-Ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo News/YouGov poll</a> conducted earlier in February found a similar split, with 49 percent of respondents wanting to avoid taking sides and 46 percent preferring to back Ukraine (just 5 percent said Russia). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the same poll, Americans demonstrated how their views on the larger geopolitical situation are muddled: When asked which of two statements came closer to their opinion, 40 percent said it was in the U.S.’s best interest to stop Russia and help Ukraine, compared with 33 percent who said the conflict was “none of America’s business” (although a sizable 27 percent said they didn’t know which position was closer to their view).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the mixed opinions on the broad contours of American foreign intervention, some of these questions also exposed partisan and age differences in public attitudes. For instance, in both surveys, about 3 in 5 Democrats preferred supporting Ukraine over staying out or backing Russia, while about half of Republicans and more than half of independents preferred to support neither country. But while Americans under 45 <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to be more Democratic-leaning</a>, they were more likely to say the U.S. should support neither country — or that they weren’t sure — while older Americans felt more strongly that the U.S. should support Ukraine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The age splits could reflect lingering anti-Russian views among older Americans who remember the Cold War. Polling from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/npwlx2cq4r/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov last week</a> found that about half of Americans ages 45 or older viewed Russia as an “enemy” of the U.S., while only around a quarter of those under 45 said the same. The divide may also reflect <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/the-clash-of-generations-and-american-foreign-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the skepticism</a> that many young Americans have toward American military intervention, as many came of age during the lengthy and troubled wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked about specific policy ideas, though, more Americans than not tend to favor providing assistance to Ukraine through diplomatic or economic means. Last week, 50 percent of Americans told The Economist/YouGov that it was a good idea to implement economic sanctions against Russia — including 50 percent of Republicans and 59 percent of Democrats — while only 20 percent viewed this as a bad idea. That was the most popular policy The Economist/YouGov asked about, but pluralities of slightly more than 40 percent also said allowing Ukraine to join NATO and sending Ukraine financial aid were good ideas, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And polls suggest that Americans look askance at Russian diplomatic demands: 58 percent told Yahoo News/YouGov that Putin’s desires for NATO to withdraw from Eastern Europe and bar Ukraine from joining NATO were unreasonable, compared with 12 percent who said they were reasonable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, economic sanctions and aid for Ukraine are still more popular, too, than military-based interventions. It’s true that <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/08174124/2202035_crosstabs_GEOPOLITICAL_RISK_UKRAINE_RVs_v2_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult found last week</a> that registered voters were about evenly split on whether the U.S. should send weapons to Ukraine’s government while the U.S. continues to seek a diplomatic solution with Russia, with 41 percent supporting the move and 42 percent preferring to not send weapons. But a solid plurality, 49 percent, opposed sending additional troops to Eastern Europe while talks with Russia were ongoing, compared with 36 percent who supported doing so. Moreover, there was <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/10/americans-support-sending-troops-to-russia-in-only-one-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just one scenario</a> in Morning Consult’s polling where more respondents preferred deploying troops to Eastern Europe over imposing sanctions against Russia: If Russia invaded and occupied all of Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Americans may be open to sending troops to the region or even Ukraine proper. The U.S. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/11/russia-ukraine-us-troops-poland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has already deployed 3,000 more soldiers</a> to NATO defenses in nearby Poland, and sending troops to Eastern Europe but not Ukraine as part of a larger NATO operation did get support in Morning Consult’s poll. Similarly, 61 percent expressed support for sending troops directly to Ukraine as part of a NATO coalition, compared with only 37 percent if the U.S. acted on its own. And among American adults more broadly, a plurality (40 percent) said they supported sending troops to support NATO allies in the Economist/YouGov poll. On all these questions, older Americans had more favorable attitudes toward military assistance than their younger counterparts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear what will happen in Ukraine at this point, but for now more Americans support continued diplomacy or economic sanctions versus sending military assistance to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion. But Americans are also open to U.S. military action under some circumstances, and in such a volatile situation, public opinion could change quickly depending on what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Today’s Democrats <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-speak-vaccine-politics-center-stage-process/story?id=73047767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fancy themselves</a> <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/combating-fake-news-agenda-for-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the party</a> that trusts <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X17719507" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the evidence</a> — wherever it might lead. This is why they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/11/17/biden-covid-vaccine-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invest heavily</a> in science and technology and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up arms of government</a> to translate that knowledge into action. But despite claiming to prioritize new ways of improving our society, Democrats don’t always act in ways that are rooted in research. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, sometimes they <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/11/20/9764324/welfare-cash-transfer-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively resist doing what the evidence says</a> — especially when it comes to implementing policies that give financial benefits to people low on America’s societal totem pole. It’s not always said out loud, but the reality is that some Democrats, and American voters in general, do not think very highly of poor people or people of color — there are countless examples of how society is quick <a href="https://columbiasamclab.weebly.com/uploads/5/9/0/6/59061709/heiphetz_craig_in_press_oxford_studies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to dehumanize them</a> and how politicians struggle to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-is-unlikely-to-talk-meaningfully-about-race-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">address their needs</a> in a meaningful way. These <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2021.1971441?journalCode=hpli20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patterns of thinking</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/64/1/53/1818233?redirectedFrom=PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misleading portrayals</a> of marginalized people too often mean that the <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo3633527.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies that could help them most</a> are opposed time and time again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That opposition is, of course, rarely framed in terms of antipathy or animus toward a particular group. Instead, it is often framed as “rationality,” like adherence to “fiscal conservatism,” especially <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/the-long-game-of-republican-economics/547721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among members of the GOP</a>, who have long abided by small-government views. But some Democrats are really no different. Consider President Biden’s <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/in-the-news/student-loan-forgiveness-likely-wont-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reluctance to cancel</a> student loan debt, or the federal government’s hesitancy to provide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/us/politics/jill-biden-free-community-college.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free community college</a>, or West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s recent opposition to including the child tax credit in the Build Back Better plan, reportedly on the grounds that low-income people would <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-joe-manchin-suggests-child-tax-credit-payments/story?id=81865740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use the money on drugs</a>. Indeed, politicians across the political spectrum have found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/us/politics/email-political-misinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of scapegoats</a> to use while arguing against expanding the social safety net, including <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-are-afraid-of-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing to Americans’ fears</a> about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/inflation-definition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising inflation rates</a>. As a result, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various programs</a> that <a href="https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-by-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would help</a> people — namely <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/03/want-to-see-who-republicans-care-about-check-their-anti-poor-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the poor</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/many-blacks-hispanics-need-stimulus-checks-just-to-get-by-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people of color</a> — have become taboo.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s striking, though, is that if you actually look at most social science research, investing in the social safety net <em>is fiscally responsible</em> — it <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdep.12037?casa_token=8_TRwpa5f9EAAAAA%3Ao8NDn5VTyQNJwPPIn385n0b59xI390HDWC9IYIRnUeS-q9n4vuUgreRkWIfM7DrQDjrxphF9WpJqog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pays large dividends</a> for both individuals and our collective society. Economists have studied this for decades, finding that anti-poverty and <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers#TheWomensIncomeGeneratingSupportWINGSPrograminNorthernUganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cash-assistance programs</a> executed both in and outside of the U.S. are linked to <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers#TheWomensIncomeGeneratingSupportWINGSPrograminNorthernUganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased labor participation</a> <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/why-cash-assistance-essential-moving-americans-out-poverty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the workforce</a>, while <a href="https://jenni.uchicago.edu/papers/Heckman_Masterov_RAE_2007_v29_n3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investing in childcare</a> benefits not only children, but the broader economy and society they are raised in. Moreover, newer initiatives like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2022/01/24/a-regressive-student-loan-system-results-in-costly-racial-disparities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceling student debt</a> could <a href="https://educationdata.org/what-happens-if-student-loan-debt-is-canceled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add up to 1.5 million jobs</a> and lift over 5 million Americans out of poverty in addition to freeing many Americans of the debt trap that is contributing to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-says-student-debt-is-u-s-hurting-housing-market-11547657473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lagging housing market</a> and widening <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/why-biden-should-forgive-student-loan-debt/617171/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial wealth gap</a>. Other <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/05/18/student-debt-forgiveness-would-impact-nearly-every-aspect-of-peoples-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research suggests</a> that those saddled with student loan debt would be more likely to get married or have children if their dues were forgiven. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That is the evidence. Yet, rather than acting on it, there has been a tendency to highlight stories and tropes about people who might <a href="https://theconversation.com/3-myths-about-the-poor-that-republicans-are-using-to-support-slashing-us-safety-net-89048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waste the resources</a> invested in them. And that’s oftentimes enough to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Color-Welfare-Racism-Undermined-Poverty/dp/0195101227" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undermine public and political support</a> for these policies. So what we’re seeing from some “moderate” Democrats today is likely born out of an inherent distrust of what might happen if you just <em>give </em>people money or help them through an expanded social safety net. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if we look in the not-too-distant past — less than a hundred years ago, in fact — we quickly see that Democrats didn’t always oppose distributing money to support Americans’ well-being. In fact, former Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt rolled out safety-net programs like Oprah would give away her favorite things. In <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/heres-how-the-great-depression-brought-on-social-security-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">response to the Great Depression</a>, Roosevelt oversaw a massive expansion of the social safety net during the 1930s and ’40s, <a href="https://livingnewdeal.org/what-was-the-new-deal/programs/#:~:text=Federal%20Emergency%20Relief%20Administration%20(FERA)%20(1933),relief%20payments%20to%20the%20indigent.&amp;text=Created%20by%20Executive%20Order%20to%20fund%20state%20and%20local%20public%20works%20projects." target="_blank" rel="noopener">which included giving grants</a> to states that implemented unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children and funding to business and agriculture communities. Recognizing the importance of a safety net to protect people from “the uncertainties brought on by unemployment, illness, disability, death and old age,” the federal government also created Social Security, which it deemed vital at the time for <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic security</a>. And in the 1960s, long after the Great Depression was over, the government created <a href="https://www.nasi.org/learn/medicare/the-history-of-medicare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Medicare program</a> for similar reasons under former President Lyndon B. Johnson, another Democrat. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What is clear from these examples is that the federal government once understood the importance of a robust safety net for the health, well-being and the broader functioning of our society. The caveat, however, is that this general understanding does not extend to our thinking about <em>all </em>Americans; the government was supportive of these policies <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/article/left-out-policy-diffusion-and-the-exclusion-of-black-workers-from-unemployment-insurance/BB47A78FB42748203E43CBDF1AABE8F2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when most beneficiaries were white</a>. But when people of color started actively utilizing and benefitting from these same programs, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/07/clinton-era-welfare-reforms-american-poor-bernie-sanders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they became harder to attain</a> and, in some cases, overtly racialized. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was particularly true in the 1970s and ’80s when conservative and right-wing political candidates <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/josh-levin-the-queen-book-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vilified Americans on welfare</a>. During his initial presidential run, Ronald Reagan <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/05/21/she-was-stereotyped-welfare-queen-truth-was-more-disturbing-new-book-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would tell stories and give numerous stump speeches</a> centered on Linda Taylor, a Black Chicago-area welfare recipient, dubbed a “welfare queen.” To gin up anti-government and anti-poor resentment among his base, the then-future Republican <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/15/archives/welfare-queen-becomes-issue-in-reagan-campaign-hitting-a-nerve-now.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president villainized</a> Taylor, repeating claims that she had used “80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans’ benefits for four nonexistent deceased veteran husbands, as well as welfare” as a way to signal that certain Americans — namely those of color — were gaming the system in order to attain certain benefits from the federal government. Reagan wasn’t alone, however. In fact, his tough stance on alleged welfare fraud and government spending on social programs encapsulated <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/alevelstudies/1951-conservative-management.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the conservative critique</a> of big-government liberalism at the time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats, however, weren’t that different either. Former Democratic President Bill Clinton’s promise to “end welfare as we know it” in the 1990s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/the-end-of-welfare-as-we-know-it/476322/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included stipulations</a> like requiring a certain percentage of welfare recipients to be working or participate in job training. This helped foster, in turn, a belief that there were people who played by the rules <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/136200/racist-roots-welfare-reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and those who didn’t</a> (namely Black Americans). And once politicians started worrying about (Black) people taking advantage of the system, the requirements needed to acquire certain societal and financial benefits became <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11789988/clintons-welfare-reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even harder to obtain</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But all of this implicit rhetoric about reducing government waste by cracking down on marginalized people does not hold up to scrutiny when examining the evidence. The reality is that fraud among social safety net beneficiaries is <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/04/04/welfare-fraud-is-actually-rare-no-matter-what-the-myths-and-stereotypes-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely rare</a>, and much less costly to society than, say, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/26/wealthy-tax-evasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax evasion among the richest 1 percent</a>. Yet we spend an incredible amount of money trying to catch and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-mother-needed-welfare-instead-the-state-used-welfare-funds-to-take-her-son?s=09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penalize the poor instead of helping them</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, polls show that Americans — particularly Democrats — overwhelmingly want to expand the social safety net. According to a 2019 survey from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/12/17/views-of-the-economic-system-and-social-safety-net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, a majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaners (59 percent) and 17 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners said that the government should<em> </em>provide <em>more</em> assistance to people in need. Even this October, around the time when Democrats were negotiating the size of the omnibus Build Back Better Act, a <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/10/13/rel6a.-.biden.infrastructure.economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN/SSRS</a> poll found that 75 percent of the party’s voters (and 6 percent of Republicans) preferred that Congress pass a bill that expanded the social safety net and enacted climate-change policies. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, despite many Americans wanting an expansion of the social safety net, it is still often hard to sell voters on these programs — especially if they’re <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-an-ambitious-agenda-heres-what-they-should-learn-from-obamacare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrapped up in large policy packages</a> (i.e. Obamacare) or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25731135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with someone voters dislike</a> (i.e. former Democratic <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-obamacare-support-obama-approval-sink-to-new-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Barack Obama</a>). Consider that a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/11/democrats-cash-success-covid-relief-515765" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult</a> survey from late last year found that only 39 percent of Americans who received the child tax credit said it had a “major impact” on their lives. Moreover, only 38 percent of respondents credited Biden for the implementation of the program. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that many expansions of the social safety net aren’t initially popular makes it all the easier for Democrats to fall back on the stories people tell themselves about different groups of people and whether they deserve help. And sometimes, those portrayals affect <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2021.1971441?journalCode=hpli20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the concerns we have</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19401612211020929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about members of those groups</a> and the explanations we generate <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-abstract/36/6/1061/13467/Who-Deserves-Health-Care-The-Effects-of-Causal?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for why they experience the outcomes they do</a> in life. As earlier expansions of the social safety net show, the U.S. hasn’t always been allergic to giving people money, but there now seems to be this unspoken idea that poor people and people of color can’t be trusted to spend “free” money or government assistance well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This thinking, though, poses a problem for Democrats because, for years, they’ve branded themselves as the party that promotes general welfare by advancing racial, economic and social justice. At the same time, they continue to fall short on campaign promises to expand the social safety net despite many poor people, and people of color, having <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/08/stacey-abrams-believers-georgia-blue-434985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fought long and hard</a> to put them in office. The fact that so many of today’s Democrats are still prisoners to antiquated tropes about who gets — or is deserving of — government benefits is a dangerous one, because it causes people to push members of those groups outside of their “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-33813-003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moral circles</a>” — the circle of people that they think they have a moral obligation to help. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, breaking this chain of thought won’t be easy because it would require Democrats to break the long-standing mindset that poor people are in their current situation <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-abstract/36/6/1061/13467/Who-Deserves-Health-Care-The-Effects-of-Causal?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of a series of “unfortunate” choices</a>. It would also probably require them to stop worrying about how Republicans might falsely reframe social safety net programs as dangerous, especially given ongoing concerns regarding inflation and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. But at the end of the day, that shouldn’t matter: While the politics might not be immediately convenient and the effects of these programs not immediately seen, that is not necessarily a reason to defer implementing them. Focusing solely on the short-term effects <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-worry-a-lot-about-policies-that-win-elections-thats-short-sighted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not only short-sighted</a>, but dangerous. And Democrats stand to lose more than the support of their base if they refuse to act. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this month, the Republican National Committee <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rnc-vote-censure-cheney-kinzinger-roles-jan-committee/story?id=82671994" data-type="URL" data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rnc-vote-censure-cheney-kinzinger-roles-jan-committee/story?id=82671994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to censure</a> Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for serving on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, describing the inquiry as the “persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.” Some GOP lawmakers and elites criticized the resolution, while others defended it.

<p data-paragraph="main">They also talk about the causes of hyperinflation, as Democrats and Republicans point to different culprits for the highest rate of inflation in 40 years. Finally, they try to guess what Americans think about love and relationships in a Valentine’s Day-themed game.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the 2020 election, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rightward shift among Latino voters</a> raised eyebrows. <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post-election surveys</a> have disagreed about <a href="https://twitter.com/A_agadjanian/status/1385639388818788355?s=20&amp;t=FfUIkI1qjxs8eHqCV2e3fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the exact split</a> in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Latino vote</a>, but it appears around 3 in 5 (or slightly more) voted for President Biden over then-President Donald Trump. Yet many of those same surveys as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/20/us/politics/election-hispanics-asians-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precinct-level analysis</a> of the 2020 vote suggest that, compared with his performance in 2016, Trump made gains among Latinos — and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/13/south-texas-voters-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in some places</a>, quite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/21/us/miami-hispanic-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable ones</a>. Going forward, such swings among Latinos — <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest ethnic or racial minority group in the country</a> — could affect each party’s chance of carrying important states like Arizona, Florida and Texas while also putting Democratic-leaning turf <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in play for the GOP</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet for all the talk about Republicans making serious inroads with Latino voters, new data from Gallup suggests that Latinos’ lurch toward the GOP could be overstated, at least when it comes to how they identify with the two major parties. In Gallup’s survey data for 2021, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/389093/hispanic-americans-party-updated-analysis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pollster found</a> that 56 percent of Hispanic Americans identified as Democrats or as independents who leaned toward the Democratic Party, while 26 percent identified as Republican or as leaning toward the GOP. Those figures represent very little change from what Gallup found in 2020 and, as the chart below shows, largely fall in line with Hispanic party-identification data over the past decade.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Latinos continue to identify more as Democrats" aria-label="Interactive area chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EvCJJ/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s been really only one inflection point in Gallup’s Hispanic party-ID data, which came around 2015 and 2016, when the share of Hispanics identifying with the Democratic Party shot up to 62 percent, while the share identifying with the Republican Party fell below 30 percent. Perhaps not coincidentally, this coincided with Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, which was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-klinker-immigration-election-20170417-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly nativist</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-worries-rise-amid-hostile-trump-comments-on-latinos-and-muslims/2016/06/05/986545e8-2a1c-11e6-a3c4-0724e8e24f3f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hostile toward Latinos</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even still, those changes didn’t necessarily produce a big shift in electoral fortunes. In fact, in 2016, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-probably-did-better-with-latino-voters-than-romney-did/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump probably performed better</a> with the Latino electorate than Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had four years earlier. That’s partly because shifts in party ID may not actually be all that predictive of how Latino voters will ultimately vote. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Latinos are pretty swingy compared with other voting blocs, as they’re just not that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912919888577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attached to the two major parties</a>. Case in point: In Gallup’s 2021 polling, 52 percent of Hispanic Americans identified as independent, which was 10 percentage points higher <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the population as a whole</a> (42 percent). And when asked if they leaned toward one party, Latino independents were more likely to identify with the Democratic Party. But since most Latino Americans first identified as independent, this means that of the 56 percent who identified as or leaned Democratic, around two in five were actually independent leaners. (Among Republicans, almost three in five were independent leaners.) And while studies show that voters leaning toward a party do tend to back that party, <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.649.1442&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they are still more likely</a> to vote for the other side than voters who strongly identify with a party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And among Latinos, ties to the two parties may be particularly weak because they aren’t as likely as other Americans to form a strong partisan identity at a young age. For starters, about <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/09/key-facts-about-u-s-latinos-for-national-hispanic-heritage-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third of Latinos weren't born in the U.S.</a>, which means many haven't developed a strong allegiance to either party. As a result, many first-generation Latinos <a href="https://www.robertofcarlos.com/uploads/6/9/4/3/69439129/late_to_the_party_on_the_prolonged_partisan_socialization_process_of_secondgeneration_americans.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven't instilled loyalty to either party</a> in their children, which is often how younger voters in the U.S. form their partisan identities.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the various forces described here also affect other immigrant populations in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> It’s no surprise then that younger Latinos, in particular, hold only weak affinities for the two major parties or identify as independent, as they often have to find their own way politically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These looser partisan attachments mean that a sizable bloc of the Latino electorate is persuadable. This was <a href="https://equisresearch.medium.com/2020-post-mortem-part-one-16221adbd2f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the takeaways</a> from Equis Research’s post-mortem on the 2020 election, which found that <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/60668f2a28dee76b4ffebc73/1617334072783/Equis+Post-Mortem+Part+One+%28Public+Deck%29+%281%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump won over many Democratic-leaning Latino voters</a>. This was true both in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily Hispanic South Texas</a>, where the Democratic margin shrunk from 33 points in 2016 to just 17 points in 2020,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the vote totals in 28 counties along or near Texas’s border with Mexico: Brewster, Brooks, Cameron, Culberson, Dimmit, Duval, El Paso, Frio, Hidalgo, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kinney, Kleberg, La Salle, Maverick, Nueces, Presidio, Reeves, Starr, Terrell, Val Verde, Webb, Willacy, Zapata and Zavala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> and in Nevada, where 11 percent of Latino voters in Trump’s coalition had backed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to Equis’s data. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://equisresearch.medium.com/post-mortem-part-two-the-american-dream-voter-66dd6f673d1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The analysis</a> from the Latino-focused research outfit pointed to Latino approval of Trump’s economic policies <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/61b7e8e75c74f5558036268b/1639442667560/Post-Mortem+Part+Two+FINAL+Dec+13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a key factor</a> that helped Trump win over Latino voters worried about how COVID-19 would impact the economy. And because concerns about COVID-19 and the economy dominated the spotlight, immigration issues that might have kept some Latinos from backing Trump became less salient. That was important because Trump’s anti-immigration and anti-Latino rhetoric had kept some more conservative-leaning Latinos from voting for him in 2016, but with immigration pushed to the background in 2020, these voters now felt more comfortable casting a ballot for Trump. Additionally, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/latino-voters-moved-to-trump-because-of-covid-and-socialism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP attempts to label Democrats</a> as “socialists” likely contributed to these shifts as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, how Latinos voted in 2020 may also not square with Gallup’s party-affiliation data because Latinos are less likely to vote than other major racial and ethnic groups. In 2020, 54 percent of voting-eligible Latinos cast a ballot, <a href="https://clacls.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/7199/files/2021/05/Laird-W.-Bergad-and-Luis-A.-Miranda-Latino-Voter-Registration-and-Participation-Rates-in-the-2020-Election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to data</a> compiled by the Center for Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino Studies at City University of New York, and while this was the highest turnout mark for Latinos on record, it still lagged well behind Asian Americans (60 percent), Black Americans (63 percent) and white Americans (71 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, understanding which Latinos voted in 2020 is incredibly important. Equis found, for instance, that lower-propensity voters, many of whom were young, were less likely to have negative views of Trump than high-propensity voters, and that many ultimately backed Trump. For example, 17 percent of the Latino voters who backed Trump in Nevada in 2020 didn’t vote in 2016. Moreover, according to Equis, even though many younger Latino voters (those under the age of 50) had negative opinions of Trump, his standing among them improved by the fall of 2020. This means that as Latino voter turnout surged, especially among 18- to 44-year-olds (i.e., 60 percent of eligible Latino voters, per CUNY’s data), Trump stood to gain.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What does all this mean for Latinos’ party preferences looking ahead to the 2022 midterm elections? In short, despite the continued Democratic edge in party ID, there’s potential for the GOP to win over more persuadable Latino voters this November. Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has fallen especially hard</a> among Latinos, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-the-national-economy-assessments-of-prices-jobs-housing-and-the-stock-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like other</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/i8sxn720xf/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans</a>, Latinos <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-crime-latinos-c9b99c24-d495-48ae-9366-b39e619c99ef.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are particularly worried</a> about issues like the economy, COVID-19 and crime, which could benefit Republicans, especially if immigration, an issue that <a href="https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy01.its.virginia.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912919844327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has benefited Democrats</a> among Latinos, remains mostly sidelined. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With a Democrat in the White House, we’d also expect Republican-leaning Latinos <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be more likely to vote</a> in a midterm. Biden’s flagging numbers may also cost Democrats support from some Latinos in the middle, as well as depress turnout among Democratic-leaning Latinos. Recent generic-ballot polling, though, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/npwlx2cq4r/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally finds</a> <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/08222920/2202029_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats leading</a> among Latinos, although the <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017e-b883-d713-a1ff-fbabf09c0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">margins have varied</a> in ways <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/January-16-19-2022_Topline-Tables_January-23-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that could portend</a> a narrower gap between the parties. (In most cases, though, we’re relying on small samples of Latino voters within polls, so remember that means <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger margins of error</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, at this point it seems more likely than not that Latino voters will continue to prefer Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections. However, given the 2020 election results, the prominent issues that voters are worried about and Biden’s standing with the public, there’s plenty of reason to think that Republicans can further trim Democrats’ lead among Latino voters in 2022 — even if Democrats retain a sizable party-ID advantage among all Latinos.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Interested in who’s going to win the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Ohio in a few months? Well, we’ve got good news and bad news for you. The good news is that there are already 22 polls of the race! But the bad news is that 21 of them are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Internal polls are polls sponsored by either a candidate running in the race or an outside group that has endorsed one of the candidates. In other words, these are polls that have an agenda behind them — and that agenda is usually to make their preferred candidate look good. As a result, they are usually too good to be true for their sponsor. FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in 2017</a> that internal and partisan polls conducted during the last three weeks of U.S. House general elections overstated their party’s candidate by an average of 4 or 5 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This poses a serious problem for people (like us) just trying to get an honest read of a race — especially if internal polls are all (or most) of what we have to go off. And unfortunately, that’s not just the case in Ohio this year; it’s true in primaries nationwide. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We hunted down every poll we could find of 2022’s Senate, House and governor primaries (as of Feb. 10 at 3 p.m. Eastern), and a majority of them (at least 118 out of 229) are internal polls. And while we have polling data for a healthy 78 primaries so far (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i73-lpVV-Jo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s good</a>), that polling is 100 percent internal in 23 of those primaries (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i73-lpVV-Jo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s bad</a>).</p>

 <footer><p>*Alaska, California and Washington have all-party primaries where all candidates, regardless of party, run on the same ballot.</p>
 <p>Source: Polls</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">For an example of how internal polls can mislead, look no further than that Ohio Senate race. The Republican primary is a crowded affair with tons of undecided voters, creating an opportunity for several candidates to claim they’re doing well. For example, the campaign of former state Treasurer Josh Mandel recently released a <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshMandelOhio/status/1488960353115557892?s=20&amp;t=i5bdn_zQDgv1e-zqvGlFHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPA Intelligence poll</a> that gave himself 28 percent and businessman Mike Gibbons 17 percent. But a <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1488636017775104000?s=20&amp;t=gu_Uv7h-MDs-ZAobqvz5iA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cygnal poll</a> conducted for Gibbons around the same time put Gibbons at 16 percent and Mandel at only 13 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in early January, a <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneTimkenOH/status/1479426941971218433?s=20&amp;t=zGwbEHe1WPt8przQrAeHUw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Information Group survey</a> for former Ohio GOP Chair Jane Timken trumpeted that Timken was “statistically tied” with Mandel, 16 percent to 18 percent. And back in October, a <a href="https://twitter.com/politicoalex/status/1451212523873751042?s=20&amp;t=hXHa4vxgB-J7w3za5PRC6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio Lee poll</a> for a super PAC supporting author J.D. Vance similarly put Vance (16 percent) in a strong second place behind Mandel (19 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, these polls are all telling their own stories. But that doesn’t mean they’re totally useless. For instance, the fact that Mandel leads in even a couple of his opponents’ polls suggests that he is a front-runner. (The <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TRF-OH-22-GOP-Primary-1216-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only independent poll</a> of the race, conducted in December by the Trafalgar Group, concurs: It showed Mandel at 21 percent, Vance at 15 percent, Gibbons at 12 percent and Timken at 10 percent.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, internal polls’ trendlines can often be useful. For instance, in <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017e-d5b6-de19-a97e-f5b7f15e0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two Fabrizio Lee polls</a> since October, Vance has slumped to 10 percent and 9 percent, suggesting he is losing support over time. (In fact, it’s likely that these polls were released not to convince the public that Vance is doing well, but to convince <em>Vance</em> that his campaign needs to step it up.) Same with Mandel, whose own campaign’s polling staked him to an even bigger lead <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6096c989138a4a7ae28a2583/t/615130ca2389bb2832f7a74a/1632710859094/Ohio+Senate+Poll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in September</a> (37 percent to Vance’s 13 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Ohio, we don’t have a lot of independent polling to validate those internal polls. But when we do, it can be a useful reality check. Take this year’s Republican primary for Texas governor. According to a <a href="https://www.paradigm-llp.com/_files/ugd/2d9332_4cdc2c9131514e6588ee56d58fae71b5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> by Paradigm Partners on behalf of former Texas GOP Chair Allen West’s campaign, West leads incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott, 43 percent to 34 percent. But two independent polls taken around the same time (one from the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/555718826/The-Dallas-Morning-News-University-of-Texas-Tyler-Poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Tyler/Dallas Morning News</a> and one from <a href="https://uh.edu/hobby/election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/University of Houston</a>) put Abbott way ahead with 58-59 percent, while West is way back at 6-11 percent. That’s such a big disagreement that we reached out to Paradigm Partners to ask more about their methodology, and it turns out there’s a reason their poll is such a big outlier: While most polls are weighted to ensure they are demographically representative of the electorate, their survey was completely unweighted. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So you can see why it’s a problem that internal polls are such a large share of the primary polling data we have so far. And in fact, that problem may be understated. While we did our best to identify every internal poll so far this cycle, that “118” number is almost certainly an undercount. Just because we didn’t mark a poll as internal doesn’t mean it’s truly independent and unbiased. For instance, according to the New York Post, this <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/28/hochul-holds-solid-lead-over-james-in-ny-governor-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the Field Global poll</a> of the Democratic primary for governor of New York was paid for by an unknown “moderate political group” — hardly an uninterested actor in a race that looks like it will be another proxy war between Democrats’ moderate and progressive wings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the more unusual cases we identified is a quartet of <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21196588-ohio-poll-toplines-222?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Polling</a> surveys of <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/02/03/poll-trumps-endorsement-could-sway-gop-voters-toward-cox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican primaries</a> sponsored by the <em>Democratic</em> Governors Association. These aren’t internal polls because the DGA certainly isn’t endorsing GOP candidates — but they’re clearly not independent polls either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If anything, their purpose is probably to sow mischief in GOP primaries, with the hope that it will help Democrats in the general election. For instance, back in October, the DGA released a <a href="https://democraticgovernors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DGA-Polling-Memo-Status-of-the-MA-GOP-Primary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> of the Republican primary for governor of Massachusetts showing that conservative former state Rep. Geoff Diehl led moderate Gov. Charlie Baker, 50 percent to 29 percent. That poll may have contributed to doubt that Baker could win the primary, which in turn may have contributed to Baker’s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/01/metro/baker-telling-allies-he-isnt-running-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December decision to retire</a>. (Though to be clear, Baker almost certainly conducted his own polling and analysis to inform that decision.) Regardless, though, that decision rocketed Massachusetts to the top of the list of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/36-states-are-electing-governors-this-year-here-are-the-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governorships most likely to flip in 2022</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in November, the DGA also sponsored a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dvrzSIZ8TJrIoGanRopkOzBbjR-mFv4v/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> of the GOP gubernatorial primary in Pennsylvania — the results of which promoted a narrative that there is <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-republican-party-senate-governor-endorsement-20220205.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no clear front-runner</a> and that that could lead to the nomination of far-right state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who <a href="https://www.witf.org/2021/05/28/pa-sen-doug-mastriano-unlikely-to-face-consequences-over-newly-released-jan-6-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection</a> at the U.S. Capitol. Mastriano took 18 percent in the survey, more than any other candidate. And in the absence of more recent polling of the race, we have no independent confirmation of how close that result is to reality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, there are plenty of reasons to be wary of internal polls — and even some non-internal polls. But unfortunately, they’re most of the data that we currently have for 2022 primaries, so sometimes using them is unavoidable. That’s OK as long as you do so with your eyes open to the fact that they are trying to sell you an agenda. And once you factor in that agenda, sometimes internal polls can tell you something interesting after all — if not about the actual state of the race, then about what one of the actors in that race wants you to think.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A majority of Americans (62 percent) <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/welcoming-immigration-policies-remain-popular-but-immigration-is-not-a-critical-issue-for-most-americans/">backed a pathway to citizenship</a> for undocumented immigrants and believed more broadly that immigrants strengthen American society (56 percent), according to a recently published survey from the Public Religion Research Institute, conducted last September. But even though a majority of Americans from most religious backgrounds that PRRI surveyed supported creating a pathway to citizenship — with Black Protestants most in favor, at 75 percent — there was one notable exception: White evangelical Protestants were the least likely (47 percent) to support a pathway to citizenship. </li><li>The share of Americans extremely satisfied with their romantic relationship <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_020722/">dropped by 10 percentage points</a> since a year ago, according to a Jan. 20-24 poll from Monmouth University. But divorce lawyers shouldn’t get too excited: Majorities were still extremely satisfied with their relationship (60 percent) and felt that their partner is extremely important to their happiness (54 percent). In fact, the decline in relationship satisfaction puts the current number within the range of pre-pandemic figures, after an 11-point rise in Monmouth’s May 2020 survey.</li><li>On that romantic note, Americans aren’t enthused by Valentine’s Day. Fifty-eight percent of adults said that Valentine’s Day is not a “<a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2022/02/08/valentines-day-ranks-behind-major-holidays">real special occasion</a>,” according to a Jan. 27-31 poll from YouGov. Of the nine other holidays YouGov asked about, Americans preferred every one of them more than Valentine’s Day. Christmas was the most popular, leading Valentine’s Day by 69 points, and Americans even preferred the second-least-popular holiday, Labor Day, over Valentine’s Day by 8 points.</li><li>Twelve percent of registered voters ranked “division in the country” as <a href="https://politics.georgetown.edu/2022/02/03/battleground-civility-poll-voters-agree-politics-has-grown-less-civil-since-covid-19-and-beginning-of-biden-presidency/">the most important issue facing America</a>, just narrowly behind the rising cost of living (13 percent), according to a Jan. 22-27 poll conducted by Lake Research Partners and The Tarrance Group for Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service. Two-thirds of voters said that the pandemic had led to politics getting worse, while 58 percent felt that the Jan. 6 Capitol attack had made violent political protests more likely to happen in the future. In total, 43 percent said that politics had become less civil during Biden’s presidency.</li><li>Fewer Americans believe that Trump <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/08/fewer-americans-now-say-trump-bears-a-lot-of-responsibility-for-the-jan-6-riot/">bears “some” or “a lot” of responsibility</a> for the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, according to a Jan. 10-17 poll from the Pew Research Center. The share of Americans assigning blame to Trump declined from 75 percent in January 2021 to 67 percent in January 2022. This change resulted from a smaller share of Americans (43 percent this January, compared with 52 percent last January) saying Trump bore “a lot” of responsibility, while the share assigning him “some” responsibility was nearly identical.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans and Democrats disagree on all manner of things. Surveys suggest they <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2020/october/republicans-and-democrats-hate-the-other-side-more-than-they-lov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often don’t even like each other</a>, and voting data shows they each commonly live among like-minded Americans. But in this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, political scientists Yanna Krupnikov and John Barry Ryan suggest that focusing on the left/right divide in American politics is reductive. By doing so, we are missing another important divide, one that may actually run counter to the idea that America is hopelessly conflicted between red and blue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In their new book “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/other-divide/BAEDF5146C86E57F26696EF7AAB800FE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Other Divide</a>,” they argue that the gulf between Americans who are deeply involved in politics and those who are not deserves more of our attention. In fact, they say, the kinds of partisans who are engaged enough to actually despise the other side only make up 15-20 percent of the country. The other 80 percent or so are focused on their daily lives and, in large part, don’t like politics or want to talk about them. Krupnikov and Barry Ryan argue it’s a problem that the 15-20 percent minority drive our understanding of the two parties and politics.</p>

			<title>What Democrats And Republicans Get Wrong About Inflation</title>

			<category>The Biden Administration</category>
			<category>U.S. Economy</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Americans <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are pessimistic</a> about one of the weirdest economies in recent memory, and their negativity is largely due to inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced today that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prices increased 7.5 percent year-over-year in January 2022</a>, the highest figure since 1982, and as such, more expensive milk, furniture and cars — and the fear that their prices <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will continue to skyrocket</a> — are likely to remain top of mind for Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This, of course, has led to a lot of finger-pointing as to who — or what — is to blame for the price increases we’re seeing. Democrats have <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-democrats-supply-chain-prices-midterms-f6de1ceb-21a1-469c-a83f-88f48fc07a4b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed supply chain deficiencies</a> due to COVID-19, as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/01/10/white-house-inflation-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large corporations</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/25/business/biden-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monopolies</a>. Republicans, meanwhile, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/10/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-whats-their-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked</a> President Biden’s legislative agenda, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-are-they-right-2021-11-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming that his signature pieces of legislation</a> — most notably the American Rescue Plan featuring $1,400 stimulus checks paid directly to many Americans — are to blame. And to be sure, whether fair or not, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-are-afraid-of-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Americans</a> do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/business/economy/biden-economy-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blame Biden</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what <em>is </em>responsible for inflation in the U.S.? Is it all about the pandemic supply chain, as many Democrats claim, or corporate greed? Or does it have more to do with Biden’s policies, as Republicans have posited? </p>



<h2><strong>Inflation isn’t just a supply-chain issue, and the stimulus likely made it worse</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the Democrats’ most consistent talking points has been that the COVID-19-afflicted supply chain is to blame for our current levels of inflation. Biden has even gone as far as to say that supply chain issues have “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAqwiD_CH-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything to do</a>” with it, while House Democrats work to craft legislation <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/31/house-democrats-pivot-economy-legislative-win-00003385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted at ameliorating supply chain issues</a>. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/opinion/inflation-economy-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many economists</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/11/22829221/inflation-rate-cpi-supply-chain-biden-transitory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> say that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/15/omicron-supply-chain-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the foundering supply chain</a> has played a heavy hand in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/10/24/22743104/supply-chain-inflation-shortages-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving up prices</a>, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The thinking goes as follows: Americans stopped using their gym, nail salons and other services as their spending patterns rapidly changed in 2020, and the global supply chain — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/business/shortages-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already had issues</a> —  was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/business/inflation-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not equipped to deal with the surge</a> in demand for consumer durables (e.g., home workout equipment, office furniture) after the initial global economic shutdown. Combine that rapid demand increase with a shortage in supply, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/inflation-definition.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-supply-chain&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_top_links_recirc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you get higher prices</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the same time, this Democratic talking point has its limits, as it’s become clear to many economists that American inflation isn’t <em>just</em> a supply chain issue: Our economic response — namely, the trillions of dollars of COVID-19 stimulus paid out over the last 24 months — appears to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-13/u-s-inflation-is-starting-to-look-like-a-stimulus-led-outlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a meaningful differentiator</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A good way to tease this out is to look at Europe, which has faced similar supply chain issues and an even worse oil shock, as it is more dependent on foreign oil <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=32&amp;t=6#:~:text=How%20much%20oil%20consumed%20by,day%20(b%2Fd)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the U.S.</a> And yet, European countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/business/ecb-europe-interest-rates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have experienced lower inflation</a>, perhaps due in part to <a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2021/number/4/article/fiscal-stimulus-lessons-from-the-us-to-the-eu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their smaller government response</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Global supply chain problems affect every country in the world, but the United States has had more inflation than other countries,” said <a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/people/jason-furman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Furman</a>, a professor of economics at Harvard University and chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama. “If you look compared to Europe, in the United States goods consumption is higher, and services consumption is higher than what it is [in Europe].”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason for that higher consumption is government spending. In 2020, a divided Congress under former President Donald Trump passed two separate pieces of legislation — first the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 trillion CARES Act</a> in March, which <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/28/how-many-people-will-get-1200-in-every-state/111604090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doled out</a> $1,200 checks to most single adults and even more to families, then a $900 billion package <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/21/948862052/house-passes-900-billion-coronavirus-relief-bill-ending-months-long-stalemate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in December</a> that, among other aid, issued $600 targeted checks. But then in March 2021, Democrats passed another round of government stimulus in a $1.9 trillion relief package — including $1,400 direct payments to individual Americans — which some experts warned at the time <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/summers-warns-u-s-risks-rising-inflation-amid-massive-stimulus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might cause inflation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it does appear that this most recent round of government spending is at least partially responsible for our current levels of inflation. An October 2021 paper found, for example, that the American Rescue Plan <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2021/october/is-american-rescue-plan-taking-us-back-to-1960s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely made inflation slightly worse</a>, causing significant (but small and fleeting) upward pressure on prices, and many experts have stood by their 2021 assertions that the extra stimulus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/business/economy/inflation-biden-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would lead to inflation</a>. Of course, Biden’s additional stimulus was arguably <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/2021-was-a-year-of-bold-economic-policy-that-must-be-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary for Americans to participate in the economy</a> at the time, and polling <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/19/most-americans-say-another-round-of-covid-19-economic-relief-will-be-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found widespread support</a> among Americans for more relief. But it has also led <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-target-biden-democrats-over-inflation-what-would-they-do-n1284839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republicans to claim</a> that Biden’s policies are responsible for the historic price increases we’re seeing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Furman stressed to me that inflation likely would have been high even without a COVID-19 relief bill, however, because of a reopening economy and <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/what-are-base-effects-and-how-do-they-distort-inflation-yahoo-u-113754047.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base effect distortions</a>. Moreover, rising gas prices — one of the most tangible ways in which Americans process inflation — likely have nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan and much more to do with the dynamics of global oil. There is at least some evidence, though, that government spending has caused inflation, beyond the explanation that it’s merely been a supply chain issue.</p>



<h2><strong>But not all government spending leads to inflation</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Critically, however, despite what many Republicans claim, not all government spending has the same effect on inflation. In fact, historically government spending hasn’t usually led to inflation. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014292114001494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 paper</a> in the European Economic Review found, for example, that the effect of government spending on inflation post-World War II was “<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/may/how-does-government-spending-affect-inflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not statistically different from zero</a>.” But <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/dupor/sel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Dupor</a>, a co-author of that study and vice president of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told me that the size of the intervention matters — and that could help explain why government spending today has spurred inflation but hadn’t in recent memory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The big difference, I think, from now relative to that is just the enormity of the government spending,” Dupor said. “That could explain why it wasn’t finding big effects, while there could be big effects now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even still, not all government spending the Biden administration has greenlit has likely contributed to inflation. For example, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Biden signed into law in November is unlikely to have contributed to inflation for a number of reasons. First of all, very <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/politics/biden-infrastructure-bill-spending-economy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little of it has been paid for</a> at this point. Second, it’s targeted at ramping up the productive capacity of the economy — i.e., investing in new technologies and creating jobs — which means it might <a href="https://www.epi.org/open-letter-from-nobel-laureates-in-support-of-economic-recovery-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even tamp down inflation</a>. That’s different from the American Rescue Plan, whose $1,400 stimulus checks don’t build up the economy in the same way, according to the economists I spoke with. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans, however, aren’t necessarily making this kind of distinction when it comes to government spending. According to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/26/biden-poll-social-spending-inflation-00001785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January Politico-Harvard survey</a>, 43 percent of Americans think that the bipartisan infrastructure bill will increase inflation, while just 10 percent think it will decrease inflation (although 35 percent did say they think inflation will remain unchanged). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/thomas-philippon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Philippon</a>, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said that his biggest concern with the recent inflation brought about by the stimulus is that it muddies the waters of government spending in the eyes of voters. That, in turn, Philippon said, expends political capital that can’t be used to tackle other key issues, like infrastructure spending or child poverty.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“People then lump together all kinds of government spending, the good and the bad,” Philippon said.</p>



<h2>Big corporations aren’t the biggest cause, but …</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, some Democrats have singled out big companies and monopolies for their perceived role in driving up prices. Figures across the party’s ideological gamut -— from Sens. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/25/inflation-cause-democrats-amplify-nonsense-corporate-greed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/12/1072295047/inflation-is-still-surging-and-some-democrats-see-one-culprit-greedy-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a> to Biden — have posited that big businesses, by jacking up their prices in the middle of a pandemic, are to blame for inflation, and that a lack of competition has allowed corporate behemoths to raise their prices unabated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first glance, this explanation appears less plausible than other messaging on inflation. Profit-seeking companies didn’t suddenly become more profit-seeking during the pandemic, nor were they more generous before it. Additionally, corporate concentration has <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164974/corporate-concentration-inflation-price-gouging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown steadily since the 1990s</a> — an era of historically low inflation. <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/inflation-market-power-and-price-controls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A January survey of economists</a> at the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found most experts in agreement on both questions: Inflation wasn’t explained by big firms deciding to get richer, and antitrust interventions — such as those tossed about by the Biden administration — weren’t likely to curb inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is an element of the prices we’re seeing today — and how Americans are responding to them — that could be explained by big business run amok. Philippon, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whose book</a> “The Great Reversal” focuses on how a lack of competition and corporate concentration have defined the modern American economy, told me that one reason why inflation is such a big deal in the U.S. is that prices were already so high to begin with.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“That’s not a statement about rapid inflation, it’s a statement about slowly rising profit margins that slowly choke off the middle class,” Philippon said. “One reason it’s particularly painful in the U.S. is that prices were already high, people’s purchasing power, the real value of their wages was already being eroded by market power before. Then when you add to that a burst of inflation, it’s even more painful.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That may explain why recent polling has found that Americans <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-find-link-between-inflation-and-corporate-greed-convincing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are sympathetic</a> to arguments that attribute inflation to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/19/inflation-companies-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate greed</a>, and why Biden is singing a fairly populist tune on inflation. But as with all aspects of messaging on the issue, whether Democrats or Republicans are more right on the facts of inflation has very little to do with its potential electoral impact. Prices have to stabilize for Americans to feel good about the economy — and for Democrats to feel good about their chances in 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don’t think there’s any message that would make people feel good about 7 percent inflation,” Furman said.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Dinesh D’Souza can always be counted on to have a bespoke conspiracy theory. In the trailer for his “2,000 Mules” “documentary,” faux static flickers across the screen over footage of what appears to be people voting at ballot drop boxes. A slow, mournful rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” plays in the background. And that’s when D’Souza, a pro-Trump conservative personality who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/us/politics/dinesh-dsouza-facts-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pardoned by the former president</a> after being convicted of making illegal campaign contributions, drops the (totally unproven and false) bombshell: Thousands of “mules” stuffed ballot boxes to steal the election for President Biden. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is D’Souza’s version of the Big Lie, the unfounded claim that widespread voter fraud plagued the 2020 presidential election and that President Joe Biden’s win was illegitimate. But it is not the only version — the Big Lie means different things to different people. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A third of Americans — and a majority of Republicans — <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_012722/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe the Big Lie</a>, but the disparate theories include the <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/oct/15/steve-scalises-flawed-argument-states-didnt-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flawed-but-plausible</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/28/donald-trump-georgia-2020-election-dead-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely</a> and the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-how-hugo-chavez-dead-since-2013-became-responsible-for-trumps-election-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illogical</a>. While no two Big Lie theories are identical in composition, they do share commonality in function. In-depth polling and academic research reveal belief in the Big Lie is incredibly resilient and incredibly influential, swaying <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-big-lie-voting-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the creation of new voting laws</a> and shaping <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/02/07/more-than-80-pro-deniers-are-running-for-key-state-offices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election campaigns</a> for 2022 and beyond. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a mountain of baseless overlapping claims piled up inside the stultifying biodome of the Big Lie: voters casting multiple ballots, dead people voting, ballot-counting machines flipping votes, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-fact-check-debunking-italy-gate/fact-check-evidence-disproves-claims-of-italian-conspiracy-to-meddle-in-u-s-election-idUSKBN29K2N8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign</a> <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dominion-servers-germany-seized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nations</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9900544617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacking</a> systems to swap totals. The Big Lie is an à la carte conspiracy theory — a bit like QAnon in that respect — where adherents pick and choose what sounds right to them and disregard what doesn’t. Each individual who believes the Big Lie has their own suspicions about what took place, a personal recipe of different conspiracies to nourish their belief that the election was illegitimate. In right-wing chat groups on the messaging app Telegram, these theories are traded as casually as chats about the weather. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“What’s going to be any different this time?!” a user in a QAnon Telegram chat wrote about the midterm elections this past Tuesday evening. “Wait till 3am on election night and lots of mail in ballots and dead people voting.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brian Cates, a writer for the far-right publication The Epoch Times, was less morbid and more focused on the levers of power when he posted to his nearly 80,000 followers on Telegram earlier this week. “[W]hat happened on election night? Trump was surging to victory. They had to shut everything down and then spent THREE DAYS furiously ginning up enough fake votes to hand Biden the ‘win’ on Friday night.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Every iteration of the Big Lie, though, is wrong. The ones in the darkest corner of the Internet? Wrong. The ones brought forward in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/elections/2021/01/06/trumps-failed-efforts-overturn-election-numbers/4130307001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits by the Trump campaign</a>? Wrong. The ones already debunked by news sources? Still wrong. There is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voter-fraud-election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-7fcb6f134e528fee8237c7601db3328f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence of widespread fraud</a> in the 2020 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, polling gives us a glimpse of the most popular theories on the Big Lie menu. Last summer, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-belief-voter-fraud-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a YouGov/CBS News poll</a> asked voters who thought there had been widespread voter fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exactly what they thought had happened. They were asked about various sources of voting and how much of the voter fraud came from those sources, either “a lot of it,” “some of it” or “hardly any or none.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Seventy-seven percent said “a lot” of voter fraud and irregularities had come from ballots cast by mail, and 70 percent said a lot of it had come from voting machines or equipment that were manipulated, but just 22 percent said a lot of the fraud had come from ballots cast in person. Racism also appeared to inform a lot of thinking around the Big Lie: 72 percent said a lot of the fraud had come from ballots cast in major cities and urban areas, compared with 22 percent and 14 percent who said a lot of it had come from suburbs and rural areas, respectively. And 39 percent of those who believed voter fraud was widespread said “a lot” of fraud had come from ballots cast in Black communities, while 25 percent said so for white communities and 27 percent said so for voters in Hispanic communities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The University of Massachusetts Amherst and YouGov <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/toplines-and-crosstabs-december-2021-national-poll-presidential-election-jan-6th-insurrection-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fielded a similar poll</a> in December, asking those who said Biden’s victory was probably or definitely illegitimate to choose from a list of options all the reasons they believed that to be true. In that group, 83 percent said they believed fraudulent ballots had been counted, 81 percent said they believed absentee ballots had been cast using dead people’s identities and 76 percent endorsed the theory that ineligible voters had cast ballots. Just 39 percent said they believed voting machines had been reprogrammed by foreign governments to change ballots from Trump to Biden. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s important to note that people are not just picking everything,” said Alexander Theodoridis, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who fielded the survey. “Pure expressive responding would be like, ‘Yeah, everything was wrong with this election. It’s all this stuff.’ Whereas the way they did it suggests they do have at least some critical view of some of these [theories].” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea of expressive responding — the tendency for people to give answers to pollsters that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-meteor/trump-clinton-many-young-americans-prefer-giant-meteor-poll-finds-idUSKCN12I20S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflect their feelings</a> or values, but not necessarily their true beliefs — has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/27/no-america-is-not-on-the-cusp-of-a-civil-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been cited</a> as a possible explanation for the high percentage of Republicans in polls who say they believe the election was stolen. Some Republicans, in other words, might <em>say</em> they think the election was stolen when what they really mean is they think the results of the election stink.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Theodoridis has used some polling tools to test how genuine belief in the Big Lie is. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/07/republicans-big-lie-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He and his colleague Lane Cuthbert</a> used <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a research technique</a> meant to reduce expressive responding that went something like this: Survey respondents were divided into two groups, given a list of statements and asked <em>how many</em> of the statements they agreed with, but not which ones. The list of statements were identical, except one group was given an extra statement that the researchers wanted to test on: “Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election was legitimate.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Basically, if the average person in the control group chooses two out of four items and the average person in the treatment group chooses three out of the five items, you know that the only difference between those averages is the additional fifth item,” Theodoridis said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using this method, Theodoridis and Cuthbert found that only 28 percent of Republicans thought that Biden was legitimately elected. In their survey, <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Jan6thAnniversaryCrosstabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 percent of Republicans</a> said Biden’s victory was legitimate, and 8 percent said they weren’t sure. Theodoridis said this suggests that the Republicans in the survey were expressing a genuine belief. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if some or all of the Americans who say they believe the Big Lie don’t really mean it, the consequences of that expressed belief are very real. A forthcoming study based on a series of daily tracking surveys shows that even when those who believe in the Big Lie are confronted with evidence that counters it, their beliefs don’t waver. Kevin Arceneaux, a political science professor at Sciences Po, and Rory Truex, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, teamed up to run tracking surveys of U.S. registered voters from October 2020 through January 2021. As part of the surveys, the pair asked respondents who had identified Trump as the winner of the 2020 election about whether certain scenarios (such as Trump conceding, the Electoral College awarding more votes to Biden or Biden being sworn in) would change their minds. Of those registered voters, 45 percent said they would change their mind if Trump conceded, 31 percent said they would if Biden won the Electoral College, and 38 percent said they would accept the results if Biden was sworn in. But as those events occurred and Arceneaux and Truex continued their survey, belief in the Big Lie remained relatively unchanged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not totally surprising — if you ask a hypothetical question, you get a hypothetical answer,” Arceneaux said. “I was surprised how much the aggregate results did not really move in response to actual events that happened.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Arceneaux and Truex’s work revealed that not only is belief in the Big Lie tenacious, it also impacts voters’ views of politicians. When they asked Americans to compare hypothetical political candidates, Republican voters favored candidates who embraced the Big Lie by an average of 5.7 percentage points to candidates who accurately said Trump lost the election. This suggests that the Big Lie is not going anywhere soon and that it will have a meaningful sway on elections. Already we’ve witnessed the Big Lie being <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-jan-6-election-lie/2022/01/05/82f4cad4-6cb6-11ec-974b-d1c6de8b26b0_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wielded as a campaign tool</a> by Republican candidates across the country, demonstrating the power of this belief among the party’s voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as polls continue to capture the millions of Americans who endorse the Big Lie, precisely what they believe matters less than how that belief influences their actions. </p>]]></description>

<p>One of the neighborhoods that officials visited — now known mostly as Fairfax — was 55 percent Black, and as such, they gave this area a “D” grade, meaning they thought Fairfax was “hazardous,” or at high risk for defaulting on mortgage loans. <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=12/41.498/-81.769&amp;maps=0&amp;city=cleveland-oh&amp;area=D21">In their report</a>, HOLC officials concluded that property prices were trending down due to a “strong colored infiltration” and that there was a “detrimental change of ownership occupancy from white to colored.” Fairfax, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/realestate/what-is-redlining.html">most metropolitan neighborhoods</a> where Black people lived in the early 1900s, was then marked with red ink in the HOLC’s maps — a practice referred to as redlining.</p>
<p>It’s been over 80 years since the lines were drawn in Fairfax and over 50 years since <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-11/50-years-after-the-fair-housing-act-redlining-persists">the use of redlining was legally banned</a>, but the impact of redlining is still felt in cities like Cleveland, where redlined neighborhoods are some of the most starkly segregated in the country.</p>

<p>WHITEBLACKLATINOASIANOTHER“BEST”“DESIRABLE”“DECLINING”“HAZARDOUS”</p>
<p>But it’s not just Cleveland. In its 20 years of existence, the now-defunct HOLC drew hundreds of these maps across the country. In total, we analyzed the demographics of 138 metropolitan areas where HOLC drew maps, using data provided by the University of Richmond’s <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/">Mapping Inequality</a> project and by the 2020 census. And we found that nearly all formerly redlined zones in the country are still disproportionately Black, Latino or Asian compared with their surrounding metropolitan area, while two-thirds of greenlined zones — neighborhoods that HOLC deemed “best” for mortgage lending — are still overwhelmingly white.</p>
<p>“The redlining maps are like the Rosetta stone of American cities,” said LaDale Winling, a professor of history at Virginia Tech and one of the researchers behind the Mapping Inequality project. Winling told us that these maps were used to codify and institutionalize practices that had already been ongoing at a more scattershot level within the real estate industry.</p>
<p>You can see the effects of that institutionalized segregation clearly in this national map of formerly greenlined and redlined zones:</p>
<p>Most formerly redlined zones are people of color; most greenlined zones are white</p>

<p>Includes only micro- and metropolitan areas with both A- (“best”) and D-rated (“hazardous”) zones in their redlining map — 138 of a total 143 metropolitan areas in the University of Richmond’s Mapping Inequality project. Circle sizes are based on total population in the surrounding area of that metro’s redlining map and positions are approximate, meaning they do not represent exact locations.</p>
<p>But despite formerly redlined zones sharing a purpose — to disproportionately deny loans to low-income Americans and, in particular, Black and minority Americans — the legacy of redlining differs from city to city and region to region.</p>
<p>Formerly redlined zones in the Northeast and Midwest are among the most segregated areas in the country. In those regions, a higher proportion of Black Americans live in redlined zones compared with those zones’ surrounding areas — and a higher proportion than can be found in other regions of the country. Meanwhile, in the South, formerly redlined zones aren’t as segregated. But less residential segregation doesn’t mean that the South is a more equitable region for Black and minority Americans, especially given its history of slavery and the Jim Crow era. Additionally, even though redlining was a housing policy that heavily targeted Black Americans, redlining has also affected immigrants and other minorities, in particular Latino Americans — something visible today in places like California. But at the same time, huge demographic shifts, suburbanization, urban renewal and gentrification have also changed the landscape of many of these cities. In some cities, formerly redlined zones are now whiter and more developed than they were in the 1940s. In other cities, there are more Black people than white people living in formerly greenlined areas, or areas that government officials once rated as “best.”</p>
<p>There is no one legacy when it comes to redlining. And its legacy is particularly devastating because, as we were told by Stephen Menendian, assistant director of the Othering &amp; Belonging Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, “Housing really is at the core of every expression of racial inequality in America.”</p>
<p><a href="https://s.538.io/redlining/#explore-top">Jump to explore your city</a>The myth of the northern “Promised Land”</p>
<p>The legacy of redlining is particularly pronounced in the Northeast and Midwest,1 where cities like Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Chicago are home to some of the most segregated formerly redlined zones in the country. This segregation is especially entrenched in redlined cities with large Black populations. Of the 19 such cities in these regions, 16 were still segregated, with over two-thirds as many Black people living in formerly redlined areas as in the surrounding area. White people, meanwhile, made up less than a third of the population of formerly redlined areas and were vastly overrepresented in formerly greenlined areas.2</p>
<p>One reason northern cities remain so segregated is because of what historians call the Great Migration and Second Great Migration. From the 1910s through the 1970s, millions of Black Americans fled the oppressive Jim Crow South in <a href="https://rosaparksbiography.org/bio/the-northern-promised-land-that-wasnt/">search of jobs in industrialized cities and a better life in the Northeast and Midwest</a>. But Black Americans didn’t find <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297198/">refuge from systemic racism</a> in these regions, especially when it came to housing policy.</p>
<p>In fact, scholars have found that the increase in Black Americans in these regions led to growing efforts like redlining in northern metro areas to keep Black Americans and other immigrants in specific areas and prevent them from moving into predominantly white neighborhoods. Consequently, Black families had little opportunity to build generational wealth.</p>
<p>Take Pittsburgh. It saw a massive uptick in its population in the early 1900s, but Black Americans moving in were limited to <a href="https://aaregistry.org/story/the-hill-district-pittsburgh/">pre-war segregated areas</a> like the Hill District, which in 1937 was officially <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=12/40.442/-80.087&amp;maps=0&amp;city=pittsburgh-pa&amp;area=D10&amp;adimage=4/49.668/-138.955">redlined</a> by HOLC officials because of what they described as an “infiltration” and “concentration of negro and undesirables.”</p>
<p>Today, the Hill District, like all neighborhoods encompassing formerly redlined zones in the Steel City, is still overwhelmingly segregated. Pittsburgh’s formerly redlined zones have, on average, close to three times as many Black people living in them as compared to their surrounding areas — making Pittsburgh the second most segregated redlined city in the country,3 just behind Cleveland.</p>

<p>WHITE74.9%BLACK12.9%</p>
<p>One reason why an area like the Hill District is still so segregated is that redlining created a lack of investment in parts of Pittsburgh that persists today. Last year, a team of researchers <a href="https://newpittsburghcourier.com/2021/09/11/report-most-banks-give-citys-black-neighborhoods-few-loans/">released a report</a> that looked at bank lending data and public investment documents in Pittsburgh from 2007 to 2019, finding that just 7 percent of home mortgage loans went to predominantly minority neighborhoods in that time period, despite the residents of these neighborhoods comprising <a href="https://www.pghlending.com/_files/ugd/dcc000_182adaaa28e94fc9ac70a51578b56c70.pdf#page=23">almost 21 percent</a> of the city’s population. And out of $11.8 billion in loans to borrowers, less than 4 percent went to Black people.</p>
<p>“[Redlining] biased where investment was made,” Bruce Mitchell, a senior analyst at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition told us, with “hazardous” areas like Hill District suffering from years of neglect. Mitchell said it’s this lack of investment in formerly redlined areas that is one of redlining’s most devastating consequences.</p>
<p>Like Pittsburgh, Chicago saw a huge surge in its Black population as part of the Great Migration. Many Black people moved to Chicago’s South Side, north of Washington Park — the area where many of Chicago’s redlines were ultimately drawn.</p>
<p>At the time government appraisers drew those lines, housing near parks, lakes and swimming pools was typically inhabited by white people, but in one zone surrounding Washington Park appraisers noted that it had been “almost completely monopolized by the colored race.” <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/41.839/-87.885&amp;maps=0&amp;city=chicago-il&amp;area=D74&amp;adview=full&amp;adimage=3/41.574/-141.328">Appraisers concluded</a> that Black Americans couldn’t be “closed in” and Washington Park was already “doomed,” so they drew a redline around the area in their map.</p>
<p>Today, there are over 90 percent more Black Chicagoans in redlined zones than in the surrounding area.</p>

<p>In the South, most formerly redlined areas are also still starkly segregated — 28 of the 31 cities we analyzed.4 And while they aren’t as segregated as formerly redlined zones in the North, the formerly <i>greenlined</i> zones in the South are more segregated than in the North. On average, the South has almost twice as many white people living in greenlined zones compared with those zones’ surrounding areas — a much higher share than is seen in the North.</p>
<p>That’s important for understanding the legacy of redlining in the South because slavery and Jim Crow laws have played a much bigger role in the South’s unique form of segregation. Winling, who was one of the researchers behind the Mapping Inequality project, told us that Black Americans in the North began to move into greenlined areas after white populations started to flee because city neighborhoods were rapidly diversifying. But in some southern cities, he said, this didn’t happen to the same extent.</p>
<p>Take a city like Atlanta. Its neighborhood of Buckhead held <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-22/buckhead-fights-atlanta-s-multifamily-housing-push">the headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan</a> from the early 1920s to the mid-1930s. Currently, Buckhead is the city’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2021/11/05/buckhead-atlanta-secession-buckxit-impact">whitest and wealthiest</a> neighborhood, and it’s also where most of the “best” areas were drawn during in the late 1930s. And as can be seen on the map below, those “best” areas are 80 percent white.</p>

<p>Buckhead also remains very segregated from the rest of Atlanta. In fact, neighborhood residents are now <a href="https://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2021/09/01/buckhead-inches-closer-to-seceding-from-the-city-of-atlanta/">backing an effort</a> in the city’s legislature to create their own city and secede from Atlanta, a <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/atlantacitygeorgia">majority Black city</a>. If this were to happen, it would be financially devastating for Atlanta since the city would lose <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-01/buckhead-cityhood-vote-district-wants-to-secede-from-atlanta">an estimated 38 percent of its tax revenue</a>.</p>
<p>According to Andre Perry, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro and author of “Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America’s Black Cities,” it is these white enclaves in the South “where power is often exercised the most.”</p>
<p>Part of the way these areas amassed power was through the South’s long history of violent racism toward Black Americans, especially those moving to predominantly white neighborhoods. Consider Birmingham, Alabama, a city where <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40193532?read-now=1&amp;refreqid=excelsior%3A7db422490180d69e9d7d29353ee7c36c&amp;seq=14#page_scan_tab_contents">bombings against Black residents were so rampant</a> in the mid-1900s — there were more than 50 house bombings and burnings from the late 1940s until the mid-1960s — that Birmingham became known as “Bombingham.”</p>
<p>This ongoing violence, in addition to redlining, meant that much of Birmingham’s white population was confined to its greenlined zones. This pattern is still visible today, with the share of white people living in the city’s formerly greenlined zones being over twice as high as the share living in the surrounding area. In fact, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/half-century-federal-oversight-segregated-neighborhoods-pervasive-abc/story?id=82678035">per an ABC News analysis of mortgage-lending data</a>, people of color are still less likely to have their loans approved in majority-white neighborhoods.</p>

<p>But parts of the South’s racial makeup are changing, albeit slowly. Since the 1990s, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/14/black-migration-south/">more and more Black Americans have moved to the South</a> — a movement demographers are terming “The New Great Migration.” This has changed cities like Atlanta and Birmingham, which have also seen an influx of Asian Americans and other minorities, but according to Taylor, the Princeton professor, the South’s fixation on white exclusivity in places like Buckhead is still a big problem.</p>
<p>“People are returning to places that are just as segregated, just as excluded,” Taylor said.</p>
<p>“Anti-Black racism hurt everyone”</p>
<p>The harm redlining has caused Black Americans is extensive, but redlining has also affected other minorities in the U.S. — particularly the country’s growing Latino population. In some cities, government officials directly targeted Latinos with their redlining maps while in others, the continued lack of investment in formerly redlined areas has caused disproportionate harm to Latino communities.</p>
<p>Of 50 cities across the country with large Latino populations,5 we found that 72 percent have segregated Latino communities living in formerly redlined areas.</p>
<p>“That’s why I always say, anti-Black racism hurt everyone,” Perry said. “There’s lots of places where … anti-Black racism and hate against brown people and other groups really limited the amount of housing options for people of color, and the only places that they can generally go are formerly redlined or Black neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>Take San Diego. Its formerly redlined zones are the most segregated in the West, with 76 percent more Latinos living in these neighborhoods compared to the surrounding areas. Latinos were targeted <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=15/32.719/-117.131&amp;maps=0&amp;city=san-diego-ca&amp;area=D5">by HOLC appraisers</a>, too, as they wrote in their 1935 report that the area southeast of Fairmont Park had “many Mexicans with a definite trend of infiltration.”</p>

<p>In other parts of California, appraisers used even harsher, more racist language. In 1939, San Gabriel, a city in Los Angeles County, was <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=13/34.101/-118.173&amp;maps=0&amp;city=los-angeles-ca&amp;area=D13">90 percent Mexican American</a>, and appraisers described them as “peon Mexicans” and as a “distinctly subversive racial influence.”</p>
<p>Up until 1930, the U.S. census <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/">classified</a> Mexicans as white, but in the 1930 census, the government classified them as their own race. According to Jerry González, a historian at the University of Texas at San Antonio, this allowed the U.S. government to more easily target Mexican Americans as a racial threat.</p>
<p>This targeting was especially clear in redlining practices of the time. González told us that officials would specifically identify Mexicans living in places like Los Angeles, and then include language in their reports like, “do not sell this home to persons not fully of the Caucasian race.” González said that language gave housing officials the flexibility to more easily discriminate.</p>

<p>It’s not just Latinos that HOLC officials targeted either. Appraisers described other areas derisively as a “melting pot … long been thoroughly blighted,” also classifying Asian Americans as “subversive racial elements” in California. Today, San Gabriel’s Asian and Latino communities are still segregated from the city’s white population.</p>
<p>Beyond the red lines</p>
<p>Of course, segregation in many cities doesn’t fit neatly inside formerly redlined zones. This doesn’t mean, however, that these cities avoided or overcame a racist housing system. On the contrary, housing segregation manifests in ways that go far beyond HOLC’s color lines on these maps.</p>
<p>“The refusal of federal agencies to issue mortgages to those neighborhoods in the 1930s and 40s — that’s one of many policies that were followed,” Richard Rothstein, author of “The Color of Law,” said. “But it doesn’t entirely determine today’s landscape, and there are many, many other policies that get ignored that are equally important.”</p>
<p>For instance, even though it is <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/city-snapshot-detroit">one of the most segregated cities</a> in the country, Detroit’s segregation doesn’t match up with its formerly redlined zones. This is in large part because as Black southerners moved into Detroit during the Great Migration, white Detroiters responded by <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22077/w22077.pdf">leaving the city in droves</a>, mostly moving out to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america">federally subsidized and racially homogenous suburbs</a> — a migration that historians call “white flight.” White Detroiters went through great lengths to keep their wealthy suburbs exclusively white, too, with measures as extreme as building <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/detroit-segregation-wall/">a half-mile-long concrete wall</a> to physically separate themselves from Black families.</p>

<p>According to Joe Darden, a professor of geography, environment and spatial sciences at Michigan State University, the Detroit metro area continues to experience white flight, too. As Black Detroiters move into predominantly white suburbs, many white Detroiters move away — further perpetuating residential segregation.</p>
<p>“The future of Black suburbanization is going to be looking at those places that used to be predominantly white, and turning them more and more to be predominantly Black,” Darden said. “As Blacks move in, whites, even to this day, still have a tendency to move further and further out.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Philadelphia is seeing the opposite happen: More white people are moving into its formerly redlined zones. And as this occurs, property values increase and lower-income people, many of whom are Black, can no longer afford to stay.</p>
<p>This gentrification has fundamentally shifted where Philadelphia’s varying demographics reside so that its present-day segregation doesn’t really match up against its formerly redlined zones. In 2019, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/gentrification-philadelphia-african-american-latino-investment-neighborhood-20190320.html">a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition</a> found that seven cities account for almost half of all the gentrification in the U.S., and by their metrics, Philadelphia was one of the cities where gentrification was most rampant.</p>

<p>In recent years, it’s become popular among some Democrats to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/americas-formerly-redlines-areas-changed-so-must-solutions/">tout proposals</a> that will remedy segregation caused by redlining. But Taylor told us that these measures often fail to account for how the maps have changed over time. For instance, in Philadelphia, young white people have been able to move into historically Black neighborhoods and buy homes by <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/gentrification-became-low-income-lending-laws-unintended-consequence/">using programs</a> associated with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which was intended to remedy the damage of redlining. In fact, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/half-century-federal-oversight-segregated-neighborhoods-pervasive-abc/story?id=82678035">per an ABC News analysis</a>, it’s now easier for white people than people of color to buy homes in historically nonwhite neighborhoods. In 2019, 65 percent of the 347,000 white homebuyers who applied for mortgages in mostly nonwhite neighborhoods in the country’s largest metro areas were approved, compared with 56 percent of 715,000 nonwhite homebuyers who received a loan in those same neighborhoods.</p>
<p>What’s more, Taylor said, simply encouraging homeownership <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philly-just-challenged-an-infamous-slumlord-to-a-legal-death-match-and-won/">in neighborhoods like East Germantown</a>, where the housing stock is old and dilapidated, could saddle Black Americans with debt. Without being able to fund repairs or escape long, predatory mortgages, these programs could exacerbate the housing crisis and push more Black people out of their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>“There’s no money to be made in affordable housing, and so all the building that is happening now are million-dollar condos, because that’s where the money is,” Taylor said.</p>
<p>Some 40 years after the first redlining map was drawn, redlining was banned under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But in many ways, HOLC and the Federal Housing Administration had already written the textbook for racist real estate practices.</p>
<p>“[The Fair Housing Act of 1968] doesn’t roll back or undo or make amends for 50 years of housing discrimination that had gone on up to that point,” said Winling, the Virginia Tech historian involved in the Mapping Inequality project. “It’s going to take probably another 80 or 90 years of vigorous enforcement and vigorous remediation to undo that legacy.”</p>
<p>The legacy of redlining extends far beyond housing segregation, too. Its impact can be seen today in minority neighborhoods’ access to <a href="https://ncrc.org/holc-health/">health care</a>, poorer <a href="https://www.edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai21-363.pdf">educational opportunties</a>, and increased risk of climate change, as many of these areas are more prone to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-flood-risk-redlining/">flooding</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html">extreme heat</a>. Without a serious confrontation of its lasting generational damage, the racial segregation caused by redlining isn’t going anywhere either.</p>
<p>“I look at it as: Redlining happened. It was an important part of American history,” Perry said. “And we must reckon with the behaviors and the outcomes in ways that never discount what redlining did. And again, it has different stories for different cities, but redlining is a part of that story. It just is.”</p>

<p>Redlining maps used in this project were originally drawn by the now-defunct Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) from 1935-40 and downloaded from the <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining">Mapping Inequality</a> project. Individual HOLC zones that fall within the same metropolitan area were grouped according to <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/geographies/reference-files/2020/delineation-files/list1_2020.xls">census micro- or metropolitan area definitions</a>.6 A small number of HOLC zones fractionally overlapped in source map shapefiles; these overlaps were carved out of the geographically larger zone.7</p>
<p>Population and race/ethnicity data comes from the 2020 U.S. decennial census. Population counts were aggregated from census blocks, which are the smallest geographic census units and offer the most precision when matching census data to other geographic shapes. HOLC zones were matched to census data by first determining which census blocks geographically intersected with each zone. Data from all matching blocks was then weighted by the proportion of the block’s total area that intersects with that HOLC zone and summed to estimate the 2020 demographic makeup of each HOLC zone.</p>
<p>The surrounding area for each metropolitan area’s HOLC map was computed by adding a 10 percent buffer radius to the combined zones in that metropolitan area.8 Surrounding area population totals were then computed by summing census-block population data, weighted by the proportion of each block’s total area contained within the surrounding area’s border.</p>
<p>For each metropolitan area’s HOLC map, a <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/technical-appendix#footnote34_cnxakh3">location quotient (LQ)</a> — a small-area measure of segregation that specifically compares one racial/ethnic group’s proportion in a granular geography to its proportion in a larger surrounding geography — was calculated for combined A-, B-, C- and D-rated zones for each racial/ethnic group. An LQ above 1 for a given racial group indicates overrepresentation in that HOLC zone compared with the broader surrounding area, and values below 1 indicate underrepresentation. A metropolitan area’s HOLC zones were defined as segregated for a minority racial/ethnic group if: (1) its LQ in D-rated zones was greater than 1 (suggesting this group was overrepresented in redlined areas); (2) its LQ in D-rated zones was greater than its LQ in A-rated zones (suggesting this group was more represented in redlined areas than in greenlined areas); and (3) its LQ in A-rated zones was smaller than the white population’s LQ in A-rated zones (suggesting this group was not more represented in greenlined areas than the white population).</p>
<p>Population density dots were generated for each racial/ethnic group within a census block, with each dot representing one person. Dots were placed randomly within a census block and do not represent exact locations but rather the total population of a given race/ethnicity in that block. White, Black and Asian data excludes those who indicated Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Hispanic/Latino data includes all who indicated Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, regardless of race. Other race data includes all population counts that did not fall under white, Black, Asian or Latino. The Albers Equal-Area Conic projection, which guarantees areas on one map are equivalent to areas on another map, was used for all maps and spatial calculations.</p>]]></description>
