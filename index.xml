			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the early days of the pandemic, there was a real sense of camaraderie. We were all in this together. We stood on our balconies and stoops and leaned out windows to clap for front-line workers. We stayed home to keep each other safe. Now, that altruistic mentality has reverted to the all-too-familiar mean of tribalism. It can feel like the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthony-fauci-covid-19-unvaccinated-americans-delta-variant-face-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle lines have been drawn</a>: on one side, those who have been vaccinated, and on the other, those who haven’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But things are never that black and white. Even among those who have been vaccinated, many people <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/07/unvaccinated-different-anti-vax/619523/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still have concerns and questions about the vaccine</a>. And among those who haven’t, their reasons for not getting the jab vary from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/covid19-vaccine-dashboard/#section-26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns over potential side effects</a>, to a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-58086377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fear of needles</a>, to simply <a href="https://twitter.com/DeNovo_Fatima/status/1424693278469984256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not being able</a> to take time off work. The <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 30 percent</a> of eligible Americans who have yet to be vaccinated are not all anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists, and treating them as such could make them <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/24/how-talk-vaccine-hesitant-friends-family-about-getting-shot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even less likely</a> to get the shot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve collected some of the most common concerns with vaccination mentioned by people who are vaccine hesitant, and we’ve provided evidence-based responses to each one. If you or someone you know share any of these concerns, click through to see what information is out there to help you make this important decision. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that compared to something like a tetanus shot, which has been in use for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly a century</a>, COVID-19 vaccines have a much shorter record of safety. But there are a few things to consider. One is that, due to the pandemic, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions of people</a> have received these vaccines. Collecting data on how a medical intervention impacts <em>billions</em> of people would take decades in any other scenario, but we’ve been able to get it in just a few months. And because these vaccines are new, they are being carefully monitored. It’s how experts were able to identify that the AstraZeneca vaccine carries a small risk of a rare blood clot condition called thrombocytopenia syndrome. The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rare-blood-clot-cases-not-higher-after-astrazeneca-second-dose-study-2021-07-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk is less than 10 in 1 million</a>, yet researchers were able to identify it quickly due to intensive monitoring and the sheer number of people getting their shots. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the first vaccines using mRNA that have been approved, research on this kind of vaccine delivery method has been <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happening for decades</a>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Dendritic%20cell%20immunotherapy%20for%20HIV-1%20infection%20using%20autologous%20HIV-1%20RNA%3A%20a%20randomized%2C%20double-blind%2C%20placebo-controlled%20clinical%20trial&amp;journal=J.%20Acquir.%20Immune%20Def.%20Syndr.&amp;volume=72&amp;pages=31-38&amp;publication_year=2016&amp;author=Jacobson%2CJM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous clinical</a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Immunization%20of%20HIV-1-infected%20persons%20with%20autologous%20dendritic%20cells%20transfected%20with%20mRNA%20encoding%20HIV-1%20Gag%20and%20Nef%3A%20results%20of%20a%20randomized%2C%20placebo-controlled%20clinical%20trial&amp;journal=J.%20Acquir.%20Immune%20Def.%20Syndr.&amp;volume=71&amp;pages=246-253&amp;publication_year=2016&amp;author=Gandhi%2CRT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trials</a> for mRNA vaccines showed the vaccines were safe, with mild side effects like headache or soreness at the injection site. It also might be helpful to know that mRNA (or messenger ribonucleic acid) is not some new, lab-created substance, it’s a <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-mrna-the-messenger-molecule-thats-been-in-every-living-cell-for-billions-of-years-is-the-key-ingredient-in-some-covid-19-vaccines-158511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naturally-occurring molecule</a> that our body produces and uses as part of its daily cellular functions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re also building on decades of understanding of how vaccines work,” said Namandjé Bumpus, director of the Johns Hopkins University Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences. Part of that understanding includes the fact that adverse side effects from vaccines almost always show up very soon after they’ve been administered — from a few minutes, as in the rare cases of anaphylaxis after the Pfizer and Modern vaccines, to a few weeks, as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01419-1#:~:text=There%20is%20now%20compelling%20evidence,vector%20vaccine%20or%20the%20Ad26." target="_blank" rel="noopener">we saw with</a> the rare blood clot condition. The <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/vaccines-are-highly-unlikely-to-cause-side-effects-long-after-getting-the-shot-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longest time</a> before a side effect appeared for any type of vaccine has been six weeks. And because vaccines are designed to prompt our body to mount its own immune response, the actual vaccine doesn’t stay in our system — our bodies <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/vaccines-are-highly-unlikely-to-cause-side-effects-long-after-getting-the-shot-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process the ingredients</a> in the shot within a day or two. Since the vaccines have been in use for months at this point, any side effects should have emerged. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Could there be unforeseen effects of the vaccines that haven’t yet appeared? Possibly. But as Genevieve Kanter, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the regulation of biomedical technologies, pointed out, the novel coronavirus — and its variants — also haven’t been around very long. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We don’t know the long-term effects of COVID-19, either,” Kanter said. But what we know so far isn’t ideal: <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-long-haulers-long-term-effects-of-covid19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some people who recover from COVID-19</a> have side effects that have lasted for months, including fatigue, breathing difficulties and cognitive impairments. </p>



<hr><h2><strong>“I can still get COVID-19 after getting vaccinated, so there’s no point in getting the shot.” </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since before the vaccines were even available, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/covid-19-vaccine-dont-expect-cure-scientists/story?id=71333281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experts have warned</a> that they wouldn’t be 100 percent effective at preventing infection. Luckily, the vaccines that we ended up with were actually much more effective than what <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/covid-19-vaccine-dont-expect-cure-scientists/story?id=71333281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early predictions suggested</a> — Moderna and Pfizer are both <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better than 90 percent</a>, and Johnson &amp; Johnson is around <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72 percent effective</a> against the original strain of COVID-19 in the U.S. — but since they aren’t 100 percent, that means some vaccinated people can still get COVID-19. Early studies show the vaccines are less effective against the delta variant, with both <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pfizer</a> and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moderna</a> around 90 percent effective against infection, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/science/johnson-delta-vaccine-booster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J&amp;J</a> up to 71 percent effective against hospitalization. And we’re seeing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/delta-variant-most-prevalent/2021/08/08/d1017f0e-f558-11eb-9068-bf463c8c74de_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more breakthrough infections</a> as the delta variant spreads.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevertheless, study after study shows that your risk of getting COVID-19 is much lower if you’re vaccinated than if you’re unvaccinated. In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/react-study-shows-fully-vaccinated-are-three-times-less-likely-to-be-infected" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study published last week</a> that followed over 98,000 people in England from late-June to mid-July, vaccinated individuals were three times less likely to contract COVID-19 than unvaccinated individuals, even as the delta variant dominated cases. In fact, even if you do get infected after vaccination, your risks of getting seriously ill, needing to go in the hospital, needing to go in the intensive care unit or dying are reduced even further. Vaccinated Americans have accounted for less than 0.06 percent of hospitalizations, according to <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-data-from-the-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a review from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, which looked at states that report breakthrough cases. Of the more than <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">166 million Americans</a> who have been vaccinated, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,507 have died after contracting COVID-19</a> — a rate of 0.0009 percent, compared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a death rate of roughly 1.7 percent</a> for all confirmed cases of Americans who have been infected with COVID-19. That means that, if 100,000 unvaccinated people got COVID-19, on average, 1,700 people would die. If 100,000 vaccinated people got breakthrough cases of COVID-19, on average, not even one person would die. </p>



<hr><h2><strong>“Vaccinated people can still spread the virus, so it doesn’t make a difference to public health if I’m unvaccinated.”</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our understanding about whether vaccinated individuals can spread the virus to others is still evolving, and though <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/07/30/1022867219/cdc-study-provincetown-delta-vaccinated-breakthrough-mask-guidance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s evidence to suggest that they can</a>, there are still important public health reasons to get a jab. For one, your chances of getting COVID-19 in the first place <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/data-shows-how-rare-severe-breakthrough-covid-infections-are/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are reduced when you’re fully vaccinated</a>, which will in turn limit your likelihood of spreading the virus to someone else — you can’t spread what you don’t have. The more people who are vaccinated, the less easily the virus is able to circulate in the population. This helps protect people who can’t yet be vaccinated, such as children under age 12, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/health/coronavirus-children-delta.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who are being hospitalized at much higher rates</a> than earlier in the pandemic. You may have read about herd immunity and the fact that, for this virus, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/delta-s-spread-seen-pushing-herd-immunity-threshold-above-80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we would need very high levels of immunity</a> to reach that point. But Namandjé Bumpus, director of the department of pharmacology and molecular sciences at Johns Hopkins University, pointed out that regardless of whether we reach herd immunity, a more vaccinated population will lessen the spread of COVID-19 — a 70 percent vaccination rate is still better than 60 percent, which is better than 50 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Herd immunity is not this magic number where suddenly a bell will be rung across the country,” Bumpus said. “Every person counts.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But perhaps even more important for public health is the fact that fewer infections provide less opportunity for the virus to mutate into new, potentially more deadly, strains. Each time the novel coronavirus infects a person, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-the-coronavirus-mutates-and-what-this-means-for-the-future-of-covid-19-154499" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it replicates inside the body</a>. When the virus duplicates, it sometimes makes an exact copy of itself, and other times its copies have a slight mutation. Sometimes these mutations make the virus weaker, and other times, they make it stronger — such as being better able to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02039-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attach to our cells</a> — according to Dr. Jonathan Li, director of the Harvard/Brigham Virology Specialty Laboratory at Harvard University.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every time the virus infects a new person, there’s a chance it can find a mutation that benefits itself,” Li said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those beneficial mutations are what allow the novel coronavirus to evolve into new variants, including the delta variant, which is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/07/delta-variant-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 50 percent more contagious</a> than the original strain of the virus. New variants may be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00121-z%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">able to evade our immune responses</a>, rendering our existing vaccines less effective (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as with</a> delta) or making it easier for unvaccinated people to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/unvaccinated-more-than-twice-as-likely-to-get-covid-19-again-cdc-says-11628276064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get COVID-19 a second time</a>. By getting vaccinated, you’ll reduce the likelihood that you’ll get an infection, denying the virus a new opportunity to mutate and get stronger. And even if you do get a rare breakthrough infection, the <a href="https://news.arizona.edu/story/covid-19-vaccine-reduces-severity-length-viral-load-those-who-still-get-infected" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccines help reduce</a> the length and severity of infection, meaning you’re still reducing the time the virus has to mutate. </p>



<hr><h2><strong>“The vaccines haven’t been fully approved by the FDA.”</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true, none of the vaccines currently in use have been fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, they have all been granted emergency use authorization, which is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not an easy hurdle to clear</a>, and is constantly monitored — the FDA could <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/recalls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revoke this authorization</a> at any time if safety concerns arose. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/pfizer-vaccine-approval.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All signs suggest the FDA will fully approve</a> these vaccines within the coming months. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the reason the process has taken so long is because <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA required six months</a> of safety data to consider full approval, so we needed to wait until enough time had passed to collect the data. That means the process for granting full approval requires a “longer follow-up, [but] not necessarily more rigorous review,” said Susan S. Ellenberg, a former FDA official and a professor emeritus of biostatistics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who was on the Operation Warp Speed Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Given the urgency of a deadly pandemic, the emergency use authorization was granted to make sure we could get access to these vaccines sooner rather than later. Plus, if the FDA had rushed the full approval process, it may have eroded trust in the vaccines, rather than increased it, according to Ravina Kullar, an infectious disease expert and fellow at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p>



<hr><h2><strong>“I already had COVID-19, so I’m immune and don’t need the vaccine.” </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having a bout of COVID-19 does provoke an immune response, but <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/people-who-already-had-covid-19-should-still-get-vaccinated-scientists-urge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we still don’t know</a> how robust that response is or how long it lasts. It’s an unknown, whereas the vaccines are well studied and understood, so you can be assured your shot will give you a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-coronavirus-pandemic-ad52011f4ca1853fad6eee41a7310c2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong immune response</a>. It also isn’t as easy to confirm that you’ve had COVID-19 as it is to confirm that you’ve been vaccinated, which could pose problems for travel or work, depending on requirements. </p>



<hr><h2><strong>“I heard the vaccine can cause infertility.” </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a lot of rumors about potential scary side effects from the vaccine, and the ones around fertility are particularly frightening. However, there is no evidence that the vaccines cause any fertility risks — in fact, <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/science-in-5/episode-24---vaccine-myths-vs-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no vaccine in history</a> has ever caused infertility. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pregnant people are also at a higher risk</a> of more severe COVID-19 infections, so getting vaccinated is especially prudent if you might become pregnant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One version of this rumor <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-syncytin-idUSKBN2A42S7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be based on a confusion</a> between two types of proteins. The novel coronavirus attaches to the cells in our body using spike proteins. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) are designed to prompt our body to produce these spike proteins so that our immune system can learn how to identify them and attack them in case we come in contact with the virus. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/28/coronavirus-vaccines-dont-cause-infertility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some people have confused these spike proteins</a> with a completely different kind of protein called syncytin-1, which is part of placenta formation during pregnancy. They claimed the vaccine will cause our immune system to attack syncytin-1, causing infertility or miscarriages. This is not true. Syncytin-1 and the spike protein are immunologically very different, and our body can easily distinguish between the two, according to Ravina Kullar, an infectious disease expert and member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There is one small similarity, but the overall construction of the protein is completely different,” Kullar said. “Our immune system is way too smart to be confused by that.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">After New York Attorney General <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.08.03_nyag_-_investigative_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letitia James’s report</a> found that Gov. Andrew Cuomo had violated state and federal law by <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/Attorney-general-concludes-Cuomo-sexually-16359949.php?IPID=Times-Union-HP-CP-Spotlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexually harassing 11 women</a>, Cuomo <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-andrew-cuomo-resign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed intent</a> on riding it out. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just last week <a href="https://apnews.com/article/andrew-cuomo-investigation-sexual-harassment-04b0e7ba80db368124a5e9c9bcf4dc0d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he denied the report’s charges</a> and said that he wouldn’t resign. But with <a href="https://abc7ny.com/andrew-cuomo-biden-resign-attorney-general-letitia-james/10927344/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Democrats, including President Biden</a>, calling for his resignation, an impending impeachment investigation in the state legislature and public opinion now solidly against him, it all became too much for Cuomo. On Tuesday, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/andrew-cuomo-resign-york-governor-sexual-harassment-allegations/story?id=76171581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he announced his resignation</a>, effective Aug. 24.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When the allegations of sexual harassment first broke earlier this year, one of Cuomo’s political saving graces was that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/4-ways-andrew-cuomos-political-future-could-play-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public opinion hadn’t turned against him</a>. But in the aftermath of the report’s release, that quickly changed. Polls found that <a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Marist-Poll_NYS-NOS-and-Tables_202108040647-2.pdf#page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anywhere from 60</a> to <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent</a> of New Yorkers thought Cuomo should resign or that the state legislature should start impeachment proceedings if he didn’t resign, including a majority of Democrats. With such strong opposition within his own party, Cuomo had few options available to him. He had reportedly tried <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/8/9/22616581/cuomo-impeachment-seeking-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to reach a backroom deal</a> whereby he wouldn’t seek reelection in exchange for avoiding impeachment, but that clearly doesn’t seem to have been an option. The state legislature had been in the process of moving ahead with impeachment proceedings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-scandals-hurt-candidates-running-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some politicians have survived scandals</a>, but as my colleague Nathaniel Rakich has previously noted, politicians faced with charges of sexual harassment <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/4-ways-andrew-cuomos-political-future-could-play-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been forced out at a higher rate</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-people-are-resigning-from-congress-than-at-any-time-in-recent-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after the #MeToo movement in 2017</a>, when claims of sexual harassment and misconduct in the work place have been taken more seriously.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cuomo posed a serious liability to his own party. Sexual harassment is something that Americans, especially Democrats, view as a significant problem. In 2019, 80 percent of Democrats <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/247901/americans-views-sexual-harassment-workplace-victimization-trends.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Gallup that they thought sexual harassment was a major problem</a>, while 62 percent of Americans overall thought the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it was also easier for Democrats to push for Cuomo’s resignation because his successor, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, wasn’t herself mired in scandal, and as a Democrat, she would also keep the party in charge of the state. By comparison, one big reason the Democratic governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, didn’t resign following his <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/resisting-calls-to-resign-northam-denies-hes-in-racist-yearbook-photo-admits-he-appeared-in/article_f75d342d-e028-586e-8631-70d52424d604.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blackface scandal in 2019 was that his immediate successors, both Democrats, all</a> had their own problems: the lieutenant governor <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/4/18210638/justin-fairfax-ralph-northam-virginia-sex-assault-allegation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced multiple sexual assault allegations</a> and the attorney general had <a href="https://wamu.org/story/19/02/06/virginia-ag-mark-herring-admits-to-blackface-photo-from-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his own blackface scandal</a>. Had Democrats pushed for all three to step down, the governorship might have ended up in Republican hands. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hochul makes history now as the first woman governor of New York, but given she only has 15 months left to serve in Cuomo’s term, this also puts the 2022 New York gubernatorial election under a cloud of uncertainty as Cuomo — especially prior to the allegations — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-government-and-politics-campaigns-coronavirus-pandemic-0eca65bc9468ec773628c4045a8470ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was expected to mount a bid for a fourth term</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Hochul runs, the fact that she is an unelected incumbent could make for an interesting electoral dynamic. Right now, she’s not terribly well known — about half of New York’s registered voters in <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent Quinnipiac University poll</a> said they didn’t have an opinion of her job performance. That gives Hochul an opening to make an impression with voters, but she doesn’t have much time. The 2022 campaign is already underway, and even though unelected gubernatorial incumbents who run for a full term have <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/stepping-up-how-governors-who-have-succeeded-to-the-top-job-have-performed-over-the-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to win their party’s nomination</a>, they also are more vulnerable to a primary challenge than elected incumbents. And in a blue state like New York, there are a number of high-profile Democrats who might throw their hat in the ring. That said, it’s early yet, and we still don’t even know if Hochul will run. But for now, we’re keeping an eye on what New Yorkers think of Hochul and what that means for the race for the governor’s mansion in 2022.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Critical race theory is quickly becoming <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/06/24/critical-race-theory-fox-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Republican Party’s favorite culture-war cudgel.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From April to mid-July, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-obsession-critical-race-theory-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News mentioned it nearly 2,000 times</a>, per Media Matters, a left-leaning media watchdog that tracks right-leaning media outlets. In fact, since February, mentions of the theory have more than doubled month-over-month on Fox News with prominent Republicans, including former <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/06/18/trump-says-critical-race-theory-borders-on-psychological-abuse/?sh=3086eaba450e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Donald Trump</a>, former <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mike-pence-gop-critical-race-theory-state-sanctioned-racism-1604033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vice President Mike Pence</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-race-and-ethnicity-government-and-politics-education-74d0af6c52c0009ec3fa3ee9955b0a8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/559208-ted-cruz-says-critical-race-theory-is-as-racist-as-klansmen-in-white-sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Ted Cruz</a>, all railing against it.        </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The attacks aren’t merely rhetorical, either. According to a July report from the Brookings Institute, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/07/02/why-are-states-banning-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight states</a> (Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona and South Carolina) have passed laws banning critical race theory-related content from being taught in schools. Similar legislation has been <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced in over a dozen other state capitols</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Few Americans can define what <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/many-americans-embrace-falsehoods-about-critical-race-theory-2021-07-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a> actually is — an academic framework that <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originated among legal scholars in the 1970s</a> to help explain how racism permeates American institutions — but it’s not surprising that it has emerged as a bogeyman on the political right. Increasingly, the Republican base is politically animated by white racial grievances, which is a major reason why misrepresentations of critical race theory — “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/559208-ted-cruz-says-critical-race-theory-is-as-racist-as-klansmen-in-white-sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every white person is racist</a>” or “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/15/scholar-strategy-how-critical-race-theory-alarms-could-convert-racial-anxiety-into-political-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain children are inherently bad people because of their skin color</a>” — have found such a receptive audience. After all, many of the same grievances helped fuel Trump’s rise. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From the earliest days of his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/03/how-political-science-helps-explain-the-rise-of-trump-the-role-of-white-identity-and-grievances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support has been most heavily concentrated</a> among white Americans who think they face significant racial discrimination. In fact, perceived anti-white discrimination powerfully predicted voter preferences in the 2016 general election. One <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/discrimination-race-religion_n_5833761ee4b099512f845bba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> conducted shortly after the election found Trump voters were over four times more likely than Clinton voters <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/discrimination-race-religion_n_5833761ee4b099512f845bba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to say white Americans face “a lot” of discrimination</a> (45 percent versus 10 percent, respectively); other polls also consistently showed that Republicans and Trump’s 2016 supporters <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/racial-justice-2020-george-floyd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw racial discrimination</a> against white people as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/08/02/discrimination-against-whites-was-a-core-concern-of-trumps-base/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bigger problem than unfair treatment of racial and ethnic minorities</a> in American society. Those views have only grown more pronounced in Republican politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, the chart below, which draws on data from the American National Election Studies, shows that support for the Republican presidential candidate has steadily grown by 12-to-15 percentage points since 2012 among white Americans who think there’s at least a moderate amount of anti-white discrimination in the U.S.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="White racial grievance increasingly drives GOP politics" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hSzFS/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="475" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the reverse is true among white Americans who don’t think there’s much anti-white discrimination: Support for the Republican presidential candidate has steadily dropped. The same pattern holds even after accounting for several factors that are also strongly correlated with presidential vote choice, such as partisanship, ideology and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_resentment_scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial resentment</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is still a relatively new phenomenon in our politics, however. For instance, I found in my research with fellow political scientists John Sides and Lynn Vavreck that perceptions of anti-white discrimination <a href="https://unherd.com/2019/01/trumps-white-identity-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were not as predictive of voters’ preferences</a> in elections immediately preceding 2016, after controlling for other relevant factors. With Trump’s rise in 2016, perceived anti-white discrimination became a significantly more powerful predictor of voting behavior with the same controls in place.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, white grievance politics now explains more than just vote choice. Sides, Vavreck and I <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwsslcf9zzcudz9/white%20identity21.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in a 2021 working paper</a> that perceived anti-white discrimination increasingly predicts public opinion of people and policies connected to the former president, like Pence or repealing the Affordable Care Act. We also find that perceived anti-white discrimination is increasingly associated with Americans’ partisan attachments, much the way public opinion of Barack Obama often spilled over into <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1017/s0022381612000904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Black</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10659129211007211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islamophobic attitudes</a> that would shape party identification during his presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These findings dovetail with the important research of Duke University political scientist Ashley Jardina. Her book, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/white-identity-politics/5C330931FF4CF246FCA043AB14F5C626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“White Identity Politics</a>,” argues that white racial grievances more strongly influence political beliefs when white people perceive themselves as under threat, which is one reason why Trump was so effective in his <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trumps-use-of-white-identity-politics-strategic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many appeals</a> to the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-stephen-miller-capitalize-white-america-s-fear-its-racial-ncna1102081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/us/politics/donald-trump-white-identity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/06/21/donald-trump-is-a-symbol-of-white-identity-politics-in-europe-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical threats</a> that they were supposedly facing. And Republican attacks on critical race theory follow the same playbook, framing its teachings as an anti-white “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existential threat to the United States</a>.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican politics have become so animated by white victimhood in the Trump era that any honest accounting of racial injustice in U.S. history is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-politics-of-white-liberals-and-white-conservatives-are-shaped-by-whiteness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost certain to draw conservative ire</a>. Indeed, I found that the share of Republicans who think there’s too much Black history taught in schools <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/28/democrats-and-republicans-are-increasingly-divided-on-the-value-of-teaching-black-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased by 30 percentage points</a> from 2000 to 2018. But when you combine the rise of white identity politics in the GOP with its mischaracterization of critical race theory as tantamount to anti-white indoctrination, it’s even easier to see how a relatively obscure framework emerged as a leading issue in Republican Party politics. Moreover, the war on critical race theory suggests that the white grievance politics Trump helped activate isn’t going anywhere; rather, it’s a key part of the GOP strategy moving forward.  </p>]]></description>

And given that this data dump was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-delayed-census-has-affected-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed several months due to the pandemic</a>, the announcement will touch off a frantic, nationwide scramble to redraw voting districts in time for the 2022 midterm elections. <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/09/michigan-supreme-court-redistricting-timeline/5296643001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many states</a> are already <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/20/iowa-districts-legislature-special-session-likely-census-delay-redistricting-unfinished/5146158001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to the wire</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to overstate the impact that redistricting will have over American politics for the next 10 years. Republicans enter this redistricting cycle with the power to redraw <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">187 congressional districts to Democrats’ 75</a>,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also 167 districts where neither party enjoys full control of redistricting — either because of independent commissions or split partisan control. Plus, there are six at-large seats (Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming) that won’t be redrawn at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> which means redistricting could hand control of the House of Representatives <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/redistrictnopaywall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back to Republicans in 2022</a> all by itself given Democrats’ mere <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight-seat majority</a>. In fact, to understand the possible fallout of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-gerrymandering-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gerrymandered</a> congressional map, look no further than what happened after the 2011 redistricting cycle, when Republicans drew more than five times as many congressional districts as Democrats, resulting in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-setting Republican bias</a> in U.S. House elections <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/partisan-gerrymandering-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">throughout the 2010s</a>. This means what happens in the 2021-22 redistricting process could have repercussions for not only 2022, but also 2024, 2026 and throughout the rest of the decade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, it is very important to track how the partisan makeup and competitiveness of districts in the congressional maps that get drawn this fall, winter and spring change — which is exactly what we’re doing at FiveThirtyEight. Today, we launched our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021-22 redistricting tracker</a>, your one-stop shop for following the congressional redistricting process.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every state will also redraw its state-legislative boundaries before 2022, but we won’t be tracking legislative redistricting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> You can look up which party controls redistricting in each state, where the process currently stands and when to expect a new map to take effect; for states with proposed or final maps, you can also view the demographic and partisan breakdown of the new districts, see which party gained or lost ground and check if the map exhibits any signs of gerrymandering. Allow us to walk you through all the bells and whistles:</p>

This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> We’re considering districts with a partisan lean of D+15 or bluer as solidly Democratic; districts with a partisan lean between D+15 and D+5 as competitive but Democratic-leaning; districts with a partisan lean between D+5 and R+5 as highly competitive; districts with a partisan lean between R+5 and R+15 as competitive but Republican-leaning; and districts with a partisan lean of R+15 or redder as solidly Republican.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These categories are based on the historical competitiveness of districts with a given partisan lean.

<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, though, the new congressional map is mostly empty, since, other than the six <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-large" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at-large</a> states, no state has final maps yet. But once the map fills in more, you’ll be able to compare it to the old (pre-2021) congressional map in a few different ways. First, you can compare the maps themselves by toggling between “New Maps” and “Old Maps” in the upper-right corner. Second, you can compare the partisan tilt of the old maps and the new maps at a glance via the two waffle charts below the map. For instance, you can see the old map brought Republicans to the cusp of a House majority on the strength of Republican-leaning seats alone; how will the new map compare when it’s fully filled in?</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the bottom of the national page, you’ll find a table where you can quickly look up the date by which each state is expected to finalize a new map, whether new maps have been proposed and the partisan breakdown of the old map (and, eventually, the new one). Once states begin to finalize their maps, we’ll move those states to a separate table without the deadline and status columns — but with a column indicating whether the map got better for Democrats or for Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on whether the party’s chance of winning a majority of the state’s congressional districts significantly increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> </p>

At the top of each state page, you can see how redistricting works in that state, including which party (if any) currently has control over it, as well as a timeline of important dates in the redistricting process. For instance, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s Ohio</a>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1780" height="810" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04.Ohio_.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04.Ohio_.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04.Ohio_.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04.Ohio_.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And in states where new maps have been proposed (currently just Colorado), you’ll also see a table of all the maps we’re tracking — including their status, who proposed them and how many red, blue and competitive seats they each have. We make no promises to track <em>every</em> proposed map in <em>every</em> state — we’re not going to be able to analyze every map submitted to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, for instance — but we will track those maps that have a realistic chance of becoming law.</p>

(Once a state approves a final map, all this stuff will fill in on its <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main state page</a>, too.) Like the national home page, this page has partisan-lean-shaded maps of both the old and new district lines; two horizontal charts representing the old and new balances of power in the state’s congressional delegation; and a text description of how many Democratic-leaning, Republican-leaning and highly competitive seats are in the new map (plus how that differs from the old map).</p>

Gerrymandering is an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-cant-we-just-burn-gerrymandering-to-the-ground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredibly complex topic</a>, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is no one objectively fair way to draw a map</a>, but we’ve settled on three metrics that attempt to get at the question of whether a map is drawn in an anti-competitive fashion. (If you’re interested in checking out additional measures of a map’s fairness, we recommend those from the <a href="https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/tests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Princeton Gerrymandering Project</a>, <a href="https://planscore.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlanScore</a> and <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave’s Redistricting App</a>.) You can also see how a given proposed map compares with the old map or other proposed maps on each metric; the shaded row is the map you’re currently viewing.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maps appear in order from most biased toward Democrats to most biased toward Republicans; for the “competitiveness” measure, they appear from most to least competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1780" height="480" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/07.Colorado-proposed-fairness.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/07.Colorado-proposed-fairness.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/07.Colorado-proposed-fairness.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/07.Colorado-proposed-fairness.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Here’s how our three fairness metrics are calculated:</p>



<ul><li>The <strong>median seat</strong> metric compares the partisan lean of the median, or tipping-point, district in the state to the partisan lean of the state as a whole. The idea here is that the median seat should have roughly the same partisanship as the state, or else it’s possible that the party that wins the statewide vote will not win a majority of its congressional districts. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/partisan-lean/fivethirtyeight_partisan_lean_STATES.csv">partisan lean of Colorado</a> is D+6.4, and the partisan lean of the median district in its old congressional map (the <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/partisan-lean/fivethirtyeight_partisan_lean_DISTRICTS.csv">6th District</a>) is D+11.5, so the map has a 5.2-point<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not 5.1 points because of rounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> bias toward Democrats. In other words, if the two parties exactly tied in the Colorado popular vote, Democrats would be expected to win the 6th District by 5.2 percentage points — and Republicans would theoretically need to win the Colorado popular vote by more than 5.2 percentage points in order to capture a majority of its congressional districts.</li><li>The <strong>efficiency gap</strong> metric is based on a formula <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2457468">developed by a pair of academic researchers in 2014</a> whose goal was to set a quantifiable, legal standard for what constitutes gerrymandering.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their efforts failed when the Supreme Court rejected the standard in its 2018 decision in &lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gill-v-whitford/"&gt;Gill v. Whitford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a> The efficiency gap is the difference between the two parties’ “wasted votes” divided by the total number of voters, where “wasted votes” are defined as all votes cast for the losing party in a district as well as votes for the <em>winning</em> party in excess of a majority. To take a simple example, imagine a state with three districts — two of which Republicans win 60 votes to 40 votes, and one of which Democrats win 90 votes to 10 votes. Democrats have 40 wasted votes in each of the first two districts and 39 in the third (because they won 39 more votes than 51, the district’s majority threshold), for a total of 119. Meanwhile, Republicans have nine wasted votes in each of the first two districts and 10 in the third district, for a total of 28. The map’s efficiency gap is therefore 91 (119 minus 28) divided by 300 (the total number of votes in all three districts), or 30.3 percentage points in favor of Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there are no House elections under the new maps yet, we calculate the efficiency gap for all maps based on the results of the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a></li><li>Finally, the <strong>competitiveness</strong> metric is much more straightforward: It is simply the number of districts in a map that have a partisan lean between D+5 and R+5 — i.e., districts easily winnable by either party. This isn’t a measure of partisan bias, but rather of how competitive a map is and how responsive it is to changes in the political environment.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">If a map scores poorly on these three metrics, it might be gerrymandered. Then again, it might also just be that the state’s political geography has a <a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/inline-files/LDTX154.pdf?YcdXhXVmKchq3lc8BQXQ5YK3IjOED1ZX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in bias against one party</a> (for instance, if the vast majority of the state’s Democrats are packed into just one city). And if a map scores well on these metrics, it also doesn’t necessarily mean it <em>isn’t</em> gerrymandered in some other way. For instance, states can be racially gerrymandered to dilute the influence of nonwhite voters,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although in practice, this usually results in a partisan bias as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> or a map might break up <a href="https://aceproject.org/main/english/bd/bdb05c.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communities of interest</a>, although these are often notoriously difficult to define (and, thus, quantify).</p>

</div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the last table on each map page sums up the politics and demographics of the new map, including each district’s exact partisan lean and its incumbent representative. Here, you can see at a glance whether any incumbents have been drawn into an opposite-party district — or thrown into a district with a fellow incumbent. (By default, each representative is assigned to the new district that contains the greatest share of his or her current district. But if the representative has announced his or her intention to run for reelection in a different district — which will often happen to avoid scenarios like those we described above — we’ll switch him or her over to that district instead.) </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1780" height="1000" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/08.Colorado-proposed-district-breakdown.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/08.Colorado-proposed-district-breakdown.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/08.Colorado-proposed-district-breakdown.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/08.Colorado-proposed-district-breakdown.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">You can also see the racial makeup of the voting-age population (i.e., residents age 18 or older) in each new district. Because voting these days is so racially polarized, this is an important indicator of whether nonwhite communities will have adequate representation in Congress. The Voting Rights Act <a href="http://www.publicmapping.org/what-is-redistricting/redistricting-criteria-the-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires</a> that, where possible, districts must be drawn to give minority communities the ability to elect the candidate of their choice — which is usually, but not necessarily, interpreted as a district where a racial minority makes up at least 50 percent of the voting-age population. But there is no hard-and-fast rule. In fact, districts with a minority population significantly higher than 50 percent may be trying to “pack” nonwhite voters into too few districts — the mark of a racial gerrymander. And, of course, districts with a minority population below 50 percent may still elect a minority candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Each map and state page finishes up with a state-specific version of some of the modules you were first introduced to on the national page, such as the latest changes and additions to our tracker, the latest news from All About Redistricting and — in particularly interesting states — a blurb summarizing the current status and debates surrounding redistricting. In other words, if you’re interested in redistricting in a specific state, you should be able to follow the whole process from soup to nuts simply by bookmarking its state page.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, we hope you bookmark the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire redistricting tracker</a> and refer back to it often over the next several months.

<p data-paragraph="main">As cases rise nationwide due to the high number of unvaccinated Americans and the highly transmissible delta variant of the novel coronavirus, many governments and businesses have turned to vaccine mandates as a potential solution.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> have recently announced that they will require in-person employees to be vaccinated, and President Biden (along with <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2021-07-29/these-governors-are-mandating-the-covid-19-vaccine-for-government-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several state governors</a>) will require their workers to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-joe-biden-business-health-travel-a1670ffa08f1f2eab42c675d99f1d9ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attest that they are vaccinated</a> or else face stringent masking, testing and social-distancing requirements.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite prominent voices on the right giving vaccine mandates labels such as “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/mcenany-biden-vaccine-mandates-nyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orwellian</a>,” they are actually pretty popular among the American public. And where they are controversial, it’s based less on partisanship than on whether the individuals have been vaccinated themselves.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, the overall numbers. According to a late July <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/28/return-to-normal-vaccine-mandates-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> poll, 56 percent of adults said employers should probably or definitely require COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees and customers; only 32 percent said they probably or definitely should not. That confidence extends to schools, too. Last month, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/353042/parents-support-mask-mandate-divided-vaccines.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> found that 60 percent of Americans supported mandatory vaccines for high school students and 56 percent supported them for middle school students — although among K-12 parents, those numbers were notably lower (47 percent and 43 percent, respectively).</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/covid-19-cases-rising-americans-thoughts-steps-fivethirtyeight-79188933</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, the numbers don’t meaningfully change when Americans are asked about the government mandating vaccines for the general population. The <a href="https://osf.io/6wcn9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID States Project</a>, a polling consortium out of Northeastern, Harvard, Rutgers and Northwestern universities, found in a June/July poll that 64 percent of Americans approved of the government requiring <em>everyone</em> to get a COVID-19 vaccine. All but three states (North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming) had a majority in favor of mandatory vaccines.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because, while there <em>is</em> a partisan divide over mandatory vaccines, a healthy share of Republicans actually do support them too. Morning Consult found that 38 percent of Republicans supported company-mandated vaccines, albeit with 49 percent opposed. And the COVID States Project found that 45 percent of Republicans supported even government-mandated vaccines for all. Of course, these numbers paled in comparison to support among Democrats: 76 percent in the Morning Consult poll (with 15 percent opposed), 84 percent in the COVID States Project poll.</p>

				Some Republicans Have Changed Their Messaging On The COVID-19 Vaccine. Is It Too Little, Too Late? <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-republicans-have-changed-their-messaging-on-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-it-too-little-too-late/?cid=_inlinerelated">Read more. »</a>

<p data-paragraph="main">But these partisan divides are just proxies for the real schism over mandatory shots: individual vaccination status. For example, Morning Consult found that 74 percent of already-vaccinated people supported company-mandated vaccines, while 54 percent of unvaccinated people opposed them. Interestingly, 28 percent of unvaccinated people actually <em>supported</em> mandatory vaccines — if you are one of these people, we’d love to hear from you! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this is a reminder that, even as vaccine hesitancy remains a very real problem, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/03/politics/most-americans-vaccinated-polls/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“landslide majority” of Americans of every persuasion</a> have happily gotten inoculated. And so while there are significant divides in <em>who</em> approves of vaccine mandates, overall support is consistently high — despite what you might hear on cable news. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Marquette University Law School is out with its <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MLSPSC03Toplines.html">annual poll on the U.S. Supreme Court</a>, and Americans somewhat or strongly approve of the nation’s highest court 60 percent to 39 percent, making it, per the same poll, the most popular of the three branches of government. However, that approval rating was down 6 percentage points from last year, largely because of a decrease in popularity among Republicans. The public generally perceives the court as a center-right institution: A plurality of respondents (42 percent) rated the court as moderate, while 37 percent rated it as somewhat conservative.</li><li>In 10 of the countries polled by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/30/those-on-ideological-right-favor-fewer-covid-19-restrictions-in-most-advanced-economies/">Pew Research Center</a>, that country’s political right was more likely than its left or center to think there should have been fewer coronavirus restrictions. In Greece, however, 55 percent of the political left thought there should have been fewer restrictions, but only 34 percent of the right. Unsurprisingly, though, it was the U.S. that had the largest gap between left and right: 52 percent of stateside conservatives wanted fewer restrictions, while only 7 percent of liberals did. (Turns out we win the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/olympics-medal-count/">gold medal</a> for polarization too.)</li><li>Between <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/fires/article253286498.html">massive wildfires</a> and <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/data/2021/07/oregons-heat-wave-death-toll-grows-to-116.html">heat waves</a>, it has been a grueling summer in the American West.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">According to local media, when reporters asked House Minority Whip Steve Scalise in the beginning of April when he planned to get a COVID-19 vaccine, he replied, “Soon.” A month later, when asked again, his sense of urgency — or lack thereof — <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_f569bf58-e970-11eb-8456-7ba1aef698cd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remained the same</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then in July, something changed. Sitting inside a clinic in his home state of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican in the House posed for a photo as he got vaccinated at last. Four days later, <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/national/coronavirus/republicans-amp-up-calls-for-americans-to-get-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a press conference</a> outside the U.S. Capitol, he encouraged others to do so too. “I have high confidence in it,” Scalise said of the vaccine. “I got it myself.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Scalise isn’t the only Republican who has suddenly changed his tone. That same week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose 2022 reelection campaign merchandise <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/14/florida-ron-desantis-digs-fauci-merchandise-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features drink koozies</a> that say “Don’t Fauci My Florida,” noted that nearly everyone hospitalized now for COVID-19 was unvaccinated. “These vaccines are saving lives,” he said at a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/florida-covid-19-hospitalizations-jump-significantly-79024355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press conference</a>. Even hosts on Fox News, where COVID-19 was initially denied as a “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/fox-news-covid-denial-hasnt-aged-well" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoax</a>,” are <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1417300107960094720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1417300107960094720%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fsean-hannity-fox-hosts-recant-disinformation-campaign-covid-19-vaccine-2021-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encouraging viewers to get vaccinated</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But their statements of support — prompted by the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant — are unlikely to change the minds of those who are certain they don’t want the shot. Some <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prominent members of the party</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalentertainment/2020/04/10/covid-19-lawsuit-against-fox-news/?sh=610644855739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative media networks</a> spent months downplaying the severity of the pandemic and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/us/politics/republicans-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spreading misinformation</a> about the vaccines, and their sudden about-face is unlikely to be enough to change that dynamic. But for those who were hesitant — but not necessarily opposed — there may be some chance for Republicans to change minds.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/covid-19-cases-rising-americans-thoughts-steps-fivethirtyeight-79188933</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Not all Republicans have rejected the vaccine, but <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-profile-of-the-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most vaccine refusers</a> <a href="https://echeloninsights.com/in-the-news/july-omnibus-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are Republican</a>. That doesn’t mean their resistance is partisan alone — but it may mean it’s difficult for partisan leaders to persuade people to get the vaccine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one thing, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/covid19-vaccine-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine resistance is well-entrenched</a> at this point, and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/04/22/covid-vaccine-holdouts-access-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns about</a> how fast the vaccine moved through clinical trials — not to mention social media <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/us/politics/republicans-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disinformation about the efficacy of the inoculation</a> — are still prevalent. On top of that, some well-known members of the GOP, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, are still embracing <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/23/coronavirus-vaccine-republicans-500668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine skepticism</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican leaders’ pleas to get the vaccine also aren’t new. Just ask former President Donald Trump. Having gotten the vaccine himself <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-vaccinated-coronavirus-bd88b0fa-6a19-483d-8fd4-d949f23f25f9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in January</a> — but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/trump-wife-quietly-got-white-house-shots-as-others-went-public" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of the public eye</a> — he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/16/978008056/trump-encourages-his-supporters-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-within-limits-of-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encouraged his supporters</a> to follow suit. “I would recommend it to a lot of people that don’t want to get it,” he said in a phone interview on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-urges-all-americans-to-get-covid-vaccine-its-a-safe-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> in March. “It’s a great vaccine, it’s a safe vaccine, and it’s something that works.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But his endorsement carried little weight with Republicans who rejected the vaccine. According to a survey experiment conducted by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-presidential-encouragement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov</a> in March, Republicans — which include Republican-leaning independents — who were flat-out noes on getting a vaccine were not moved by Trump’s words or deeds. However, among Republicans who were undecided, hearing that Trump himself was vaccinated and encouraging others to do the same did move the needle. Unvaccinated Republicans were interviewed twice, and in the second survey, half were told that Trump had endorsed the vaccine. Per the findings, those who said yes or maybe on the first survey were 15 percentage points more likely to say they would get the jab after hearing about Trump’s endorsement, compared with the group who didn’t hear the cue. However, those who said no on the first survey largely weren’t influenced by Trump’s statements.</p>

That group was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccines-optimism-pandemic-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely</a> overall to say no or maybe when asked whether they would get the vaccine, but CBS News/YouGov found that Biden’s endorsement made them less certain; it both softened some noes to maybes and moved some yeses to maybes.<strong> </strong>However, in follow-up questioning, most of those “maybe” respondents said they would “probably” get the vaccine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, an <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/8w7calyx30/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov survey</a> from late July/early August showed that Republicans who said they didn’t plan to get the vaccine wouldn’t be swayed even if they were told that Trump had gotten it and encouraged others to do the same. Just 3 percent of respondents who told the pollster they didn’t plan to get vaccinated said they would be persuaded to get the shot if Trump urged them to do so, including only 5 percent of Republicans. In a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/06/29/could-trump-boost-vaccination-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate survey from June</a>, The Economist/YouGov found that among adults who said they would not get the vaccine, a larger share said they trusted medical advice from Trump (53 percent) than from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (14 percent), Dr. Anthony Fauci (9 percent) and Biden (7 percent). Still, only 3 percent said that Trump’s endorsement would sway them to get the vaccine themselves.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What’s also working against Republicans’ new pro-vaccine push is that hesitancy and refusal rates have been stagnant so far, especially in red states. According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/covid19-vaccine-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult’s tracking</a>, the share of Americans who said they were either unsure or unwilling to get vaccinated has decreased by only 3 points in two months, from 34 percent in May to 31 percent in July. That trend is particularly entrenched in states that heavily supported Trump. On average, in the 20 states that backed him by more than 10 points in the 2020 election, 25.2 percent of respondents said in the July survey that they were unwilling to get vaccinated (essentially unchanged from 25.9 percent in May). By contrast, in the 16 states that voted for Biden by more than 10 points, an average of only 15.0 percent of respondents in the July survey said they were unwilling to get vaccinated, similar to the 15.4 percent who said the same in May. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the future is unknowable, and some newly released research suggests the opposite of what these polls were finding: that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/32/e2106559118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine endorsements from elite Republicans</a> may in fact have a positive impact on everyday voters. But that research is based on a study from March, a time when <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/?gclid=CjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGjTjKjKbxgjc8ItKnZKZyfOPB7GnzRF91gOP7Mam52xkxpaGflQIuxoCzaMQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a greater share of unvaccinated Americans were on the fence</a> about the vaccine. Yet new Morning Consult polling shows that vaccine skepticism <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/04/fox-news-viewers-covid-vaccine-hesitancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has decreased slightly</a> among Fox News viewers after more hosts began promoting vaccinations, suggesting that the network’s new attitude may be having some impact on its audience — though Fox News Republicans were already less hesitant about vaccines than Republicans who get their news from more far-right sources. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, it’s possible that hesitancy might decrease as the delta variant continues its spread, and <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine rates had been ticking up slightly</a> in the last half of July. However, <a href="https://echeloninsights.com/in-the-news/july-omnibus-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July survey from Echelon Insights</a> suggests the increase may be due more to Democrats getting vaccinated than to any changes among Republicans: The share of Republicans saying they probably wouldn’t get the vaccine increased by 3 points from their June survey, while the share of Democrats who said the same decreased by 3 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that GOP leaders touting vaccines will have the opposite effect and cause some Republicans to double-down on their anti-vaccine sentiments. That’s because when people resist persuasion, they can become <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-08203-005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more firm in their beliefs</a>. Plus, public figures <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/05/13/celebrity-vaccine-covid-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t typically influence people’s actions</a>. As the Kaiser Family Foundation previously noted, pro-vaccine messages from doctors, family members and friends <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/briefing/vaccine-skepticism-vaccination-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have the greatest impact</a> on vaccine skeptics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, if nothing else, it’s objectively a good sign that some elected Republicans are beginning to take the pandemic seriously. It shows their concern about the country’s stalled progress, and represents a broader acknowledgment that a complete return to normalcy requires their base to step up. </p>

	</aside><p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James released the results of an investigation into Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s history of alleged sexual harassment. The report found evidence that Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women and created a hostile workplace. He apologized but flatly denied the allegations. Cuomo is now facing overwhelming pressure to resign from numerous elected officials, including President Biden. According to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/marist-poll-results-analysis-governor-andrew-cuomo/#sthash.n8XGuWuU.dpbs">snap poll</a> following the report, 59 percent of New Yorkers said Cuomo should resign. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew talks about what the report means for Cuomo and the political future of New York.</p>

Andrew Cuomo was released.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Back in March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/4-ways-andrew-cuomos-political-future-could-play-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political future hung in limbo</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://lindseyboylan4ny.medium.com/my-story-of-working-with-governor-cuomo-e664d4814b4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/andrew-cuomo-sexual-harassment-albany-reporter.html?utm_campaign=nym&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=s1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women</a> had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/nyregion/cuomo-charlotte-bennett-sexual-harassment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/third-former-andrew-cuomo-aide-describes-inappropriate-workplace-treatment-11615081956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forward</a> with <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Female-aide-said-Cuomo-aggressively-groped-her-at-16015863.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cuomo-toxic-workplace/2021/03/06/7f7c5b9c-7dd3-11eb-b3d1-9e5aa3d5220c_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegations</a> of sexual harassment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/nyregion/cuomo-harassment-anna-ruch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">against</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/nyregion/alyssa-mcgrath-cuomo-harassment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuomo</a>, and in light of these allegations, there was a growing consensus among Democratic lawmakers that Cuomo should resign. (Both of New York’s U.S. senators, at least 20 of its 27 U.S. representatives, at least 45 of its 63 state senators and at least 55 of its 150 assembly members had all <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2021/03/notable-lawmakers-calling-for-cuomo-to-resign/175124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called on Cuomo to resign from office</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But <a href="https://twitter.com/Kimjeanpierre/status/1368982802897702912?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some Democrats</a> — most prominently <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cuomo-resign-allegations-confirmed-biden-exclusive-abc-news/story?id=76499093" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden</a> — said they would withhold judgment until state Attorney General Letitia James conducted an independent investigation into the allegations. And after months passed with no news about the scandal, even some politicians who had condemned Cuomo <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/04/21/senate-majority-leader-appears-alongside-cuomo-after-calling-for-his-resignation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed to have moved on</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That changed on Tuesday when James released a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.08.03_nyag_-_investigative_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> concluding that Cuomo violated state and federal law by <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/Attorney-general-concludes-Cuomo-sexually-16359949.php?IPID=Times-Union-HP-CP-Spotlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexually harassing 11 women</a>, in addition to retaliating against the first woman who publicly accused him and creating a hostile work environment for women. In a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?513912-1/ny-governor-cuomo-denies-sexual-harassment-allegations-independent-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video statement</a> later in the day, Cuomo denied making inappropriate sexual advances, but this did not stop <a href="https://twitter.com/JerryZremski/status/1422615177808261132?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several lawmakers</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/luisferre/status/1422598783754440705?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewing</a> their <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewSolender/status/1422595029655240720?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calls</a> for him to step down. Indeed, he is now under more pressure to resign than ever, as some <a href="https://westfaironline.com/139039/breaking-news-latimer-cuomo-must-resign-in-wake-of-ags-sexual-harassment-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new names</a>, including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/biden-calls-on-cuomo-to-resign-after-bombshell-sexual-harassment-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden</a> and <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/8321-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, have <a href="https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1422606310324023297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined the chorus</a> as well. <em>[Editor’s note: After publication, Biden said Cuomo should resign, as did Pelosi.]</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The political consensus around calls for Cuomo’s resignation reflects just how much <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/247901/americans-views-sexual-harassment-workplace-victimization-trends.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans’ attitudes about the seriousness of sexual harassment</a> have changed — especially among Democrats. In 1998, Gallup found that 50 percent of Americans thought that sexual harassment was a major problem; by 2019, that number had risen to 62 percent. And among Democrats that number had risen even higher: 80 percent said sexual harassment was a major problem. Those kinds of numbers make it very difficult for any Democratic politician to stand by Cuomo and explain why even some of his <a href="https://twitter.com/chriscquinn/status/1422594300471296000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closest allies</a> have now broken with him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So will Cuomo heed his colleagues’ calls for him to resign? A lot could depend on whether public opinion turns against him as a result of this report. The <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/2021/07/01/only-one-third-of-voters-say-cuomo-should-run-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last poll</a> before James’s report, conducted June 22-29 by Siena College, found that, while New York registered voters were divided in their opinion of Cuomo (45 percent had a favorable view of him, while 47 percent had an unfavorable view), only 23 percent wanted him to resign immediately. And that wasn’t just because New Yorkers had moved on from or forgotten about the allegations; even in <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/2021/03/15/voters-say-cuomo-should-not-resign-50-35/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early March</a>, in the immediate aftermath of the allegations, New York registered voters told Siena 50 percent to 35 percent that they did not think he should resign. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday morning, however, <a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/marist-poll-results-analysis-governor-andrew-cuomo/#sthash.3QPgSB3r.dpbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marist College</a> released the first poll conducted since James’s report, and it found that 59 percent of New Yorkers wanted Cuomo to resign — and if he doesn’t resign, the same share thinks the state legislature should impeach him. This is just one poll, but it could suggest that many New Yorkers have found the report’s findings disturbing enough to change their mind. Then again, in the June Siena survey, a plurality (42 percent) of voters thought James’s investigation would uncover evidence that Cuomo committed sexual harassment — and yet only 23 percent wanted him to resign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, Cuomo seems as if he will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/4-ways-andrew-cuomos-political-future-could-play-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try to hold onto power</a> as long as he feels he still has a public mandate. He may reason that resignation would forever tarnish his political legacy, whereas if he serves out his term, the scandal may fade into the background — as it did from March through July, and as Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/resisting-calls-to-resign-northam-denies-hes-in-racist-yearbook-photo-admits-he-appeared-in/article_f75d342d-e028-586e-8631-70d52424d604.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blackface scandal</a> did (in fact, Northam’s popularity has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/northam-job-approval-poll/2020/10/22/1e6e7bc8-13c5-11eb-ad6f-36c93e6e94fb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully recovered</a>). Cuomo may even still be entertaining thoughts of running for reelection. He has a whopping <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-cuomo-campaign-disclosure-scandals-fundraising-20210715-mkfwqjhzmrhqdeiwo7jisajkvm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$18.5 million</a> in his campaign war chest, and New Yorkers still approve of many aspects of his governorship, including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic (despite his administration’s alleged <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cuomo-advisers-altered-report-on-covid-19-nursing-home-deaths-11614910855" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cover-up</a> of thousands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/nyregion/nursing-home-deaths-cuomo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19-related deaths</a> at New York nursing homes).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Cuomo’s fate also may not be fully in his own hands. Back in March, Democratic legislators raised the possibility of <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/state/2021/03/how-would-a-cuomo-impeachment-work-a-look-at-new-yorks-process.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impeaching Cuomo</a> for his misdeeds, and several <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/andrew-cuomo-impeachment-sexual-harassment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated their support for impeachment</a> on Tuesday. According to state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, James’s report has been <a href="https://twitter.com/ShannanFerry/status/1422590234735353856?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referred</a> to the Assembly committee in charge of impeachment, which Newsday <a href="https://twitter.com/YanceyRoy/status/1422596548857405442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> will meet on Monday. Clearly, this is a fast-moving story, and Cuomo’s future is still very much up in the air.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican, there’s a major battle over the future of your party taking place today in Ohio. Voters in two Buckeye State congressional districts will go to the polls on Tuesday for a pair of special primary elections that will effectively decide their next congresspeople. In the deep-blue 11th District, Democrats will once again choose between a progressive icon or an establishment stalwart. And in the red 15th District, the power of former President Donald Trump’s endorsement in Republican primaries will be put to the test for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-special-election-in-texass-6th-district-will-test-trumps-influence-on-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second consecutive week</a>. Here’s what to expect in each contest.</p>



<h2><strong>Ohio’s 11th District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner has been a major figure in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party ever since she defected from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s orbit to <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/nina-turner-endorses-bernie-sanders-215809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. She then became president of Our Revolution, a group devoted to electing progressive candidates, in 2017 and co-chair of Sanders’s presidential campaign in 2020. Turner, however, didn’t seek higher office herself until then-Rep. Marcia Fudge left Congress earlier this year to become President Biden’s secretary of housing and urban development.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not long after Turner got into the race for Fudge’s <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/OH/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleveland-based seat</a> last December, she <a href="https://ninaturner.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned the backing</a> of virtually the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire progressive apparatus</a>: Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, the Working Families Party, Sanders and every member of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Squad_(United_States_Congress)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Squad</a>.” Her national profile — and access to <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/04/nina-turner-shontel-brown-tout-a-significant-fundraising-edge-in-11th-congressional-district-democratic-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national money</a> — helped her jump out to a wide lead in the early days of the Democratic primary, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the race is hardly entirely a done deal for Turner, who faces tough competition in Cuyahoga County Council Member Shontel Brown. Either Turner or Brown would be the third consecutive Black woman to represent the 11th District, but they represent very different wings of the party. As chair of the county Democratic Party, Brown has developed strong relationships with local power brokers — including Fudge. Though Fudge hasn’t issued a formal endorsement, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gatqZzHC9ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brown campaign ad</a> features none other than Fudge’s mother saying “Shontel Brown is Marcia’s protegee” and “we’re voting for Shontel Brown.” But perhaps more importantly, Brown has also become the candidate of choice for Turner’s nemeses in the national party establishment. In June, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/16/hilary-clinton-ohio-special-election-494953" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton endorsed Brown</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/06/south-carolina-rep-james-clyburn-endorses-shontel-brown-for-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn</a> and the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/07/congressional-black-caucus-ohio-special-election-498596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Black Caucus PAC</a>. And the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, a group that supports pro-Israel Democrats, has spent almost $2 million to help Brown with messaging that <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/4945195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacks Turner</a> for criticizing Biden. (The DMFI PAC <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/divides-on-israel-among-democrats-highlighted-in-ohio-special-congressional-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Brown in February</a> partly in response to Turner’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ninaturner/status/1392328115909664774?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palestinian sympathies</a>.) Brown herself has leaned into the establishment branding, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qezc954Gk18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">airing ads</a> emphasizing how closely she will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhUoBo-F7pQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with Biden</a> and trying to make the race a referendum on <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/4952328?link_id=35&amp;can_id=5f27a3767bd4756f5c4ec89f31b71bbe&amp;source=email-morning-digest-why-one-candidates-fealty-to-trump-has-pennsylvania-republicans-looking-elsewhere&amp;email_referrer=email_1242982&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-why-one-candidates-fealty-to-trump-has-pennsylvania-republicans-looking-elsewhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party loyalty</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To hear Brown and her allies tell it, this has helped Brown <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017a-9b36-dffc-a5fa-db7665bc0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close the gap</a> with Turner in the final month of the race. For instance, a <a href="https://jewishinsider.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/22210942/FILE_8871.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 13-17 poll</a> from the Mellman Group on behalf of the DMFI PAC put Turner at 41 percent and Brown at 36 percent. However, that still suggests that Turner is the front-runner, especially when you consider that internal polls tend to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overestimate the side that sponsors them</a>. (There has been no independent polling of the race, unless you count a <a href="https://freebeacon.com/elections/beacon-poll-shows-brown-and-turner-tied-in-ohio-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 8-10 poll</a> by TargetPoint Consulting for the conservative Washington Free Beacon — but the wording of some of that poll’s questions suggests they are rooting against Turner.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fundraising numbers tell a similar story: Brown has undeniably picked up the pace in recent months, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/07/nina-turner-leads-shontel-brown-in-fundraising-as-out-of-state-money-bolsters-both-congressional-campaigns.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $1.3 million</a> from April 1 through July 14, bringing her total haul through July 14 to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OH11169/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.1 million</a>. But Turner has been a consistent financial powerhouse and raised more than twice as much for the cycle: <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OH11151/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.5 million</a>. Eleven other candidates are also in the race, but both polling and fundraising suggest they are no threat to win; no other active candidate has polled higher than 4 percent or raised more than $65,000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s easy to boil this race down to another progressive vs. establishment fight — and it is that — but if Turner wins, it will be important not to draw the wrong conclusions. The majority-Black 11th District is no progressive stronghold (it voted <a href="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/OH-D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68 percent to 32 percent</a> for Clinton in the 2016 primary), and as such, Turner has <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nina-turner-democratic-primary-cleveland_n_60e60c37e4b0fe5f06a7d9b7?lrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run a correspondingly meat-and-potatoes campaign</a> despite her national profile as an outspoken progressive. For instance, instead of touting her post-2016 career, she has emphasized her tenure in the state legislature, where she had a reputation as a productive team player. (Case in point: The first section on her endorsements page is “Ohio Elected Officials.”) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A Turner victory would certainly represent a win for the national progressive movement, both in terms of the efficiency of its campaign apparatus and the addition of another prominent voice in Congress. But it wouldn’t necessarily be a sign that nonwhite voters, a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-do-black-democrats-usually-prefer-establishment-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditionally moderate group</a>, are warming to progressive ideas, although it might point toward a winning strategy for progressives in areas where nonwhite voters are the majority.</p>



<h2><strong>Ohio’s 15th District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ohio’s other vacant congressional district is the conservative 15th, which takes in a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/OH/15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide swath of south-central Ohio</a> from the Columbus suburbs to Appalachia. The race that matters here is on the Republican side, but the contest is just as unpredictable as in the 11th. Eleven candidates are running here, but there is no clear front-runner; instead, a case can be made that around a half-dozen are in the hunt.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former Rep. Steve Stivers resigned from this seat in May to lead the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, and he quickly <a href="https://www.lancastereaglegazette.com/story/news/2021/06/02/steve-stivers-endorses-jeff-lare-replace-him-congress-15th-district/7511217002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed state Rep. Jeff LaRe</a> to be his successor. But LaRe has struggled with fundraising (he took in only <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OH15145/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$239,299</a> from April 27 through July 14); luckily for him, though, Stivers put his money where his mouth is: In an unusual move, the former congressman spent <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1420370862541246465?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300,000</a> of his leftover campaign funds on ads urging people to vote for LaRe. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But then came what is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually the coup de grâce</a> in a GOP primary: On June 8, Trump <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/06/08/trump-endorses-mike-carey-ohio-15th-congressional-district-race/7611520002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> coal lobbyist Mike Carey. And Make America Great Again Action, a super PAC run by former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/07/trump-aligned-pac-makes-last-minute-buy-in-special-election-for-ohios-15th-congressional-district.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed up the endorsement</a> with over $400,000 in spending on Carey’s behalf. Carey has also raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OH15228/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$460,404</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, Trump’s endorsement has not <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/14/trump-allies-special-election-499655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coalesced other conservative influencers</a> around his pick, though. For example, Conservative Outsider PAC, which is <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/contrib.php?cmte=C00748475&amp;cycle=2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded</a> partly by the anti-tax group the Club for Growth, has spent $232,000 against Carey. And Sen. Rand Paul has endorsed a third candidate, former state Rep. Ron Hood. Hood hasn’t raised much cash himself (just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0OH18101/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$153,801</a>), but he’s benefited from $678,357 in spending from Paul’s allies at Protect Freedom PAC. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also in the race are state Sen. Bob Peterson, golf-course owner Tom Hwang and minister Ruth Edmonds. Peterson has a healthy number of <a href="https://www.bobpetersonforcongress.com/endorsements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local endorsers</a> and has raised more money from individual contributions than any other candidate ($441,500; his total fundraising stands at <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OH15129/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$555,700</a>). Hwang, though, has raised the most money overall (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OH15202/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$578,560</a>), thanks almost entirely to self-funding. For her part, Edmonds has raised little money (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OH15160/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$162,327</a>) but does boast the endorsement of Debbie Meadows, the wife of Trump’s former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There have been no independent polls of the race; a <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewJTobias/status/1408544144461533189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates poll</a> released by the Carey campaign in late June did find Carey in the lead with 20 percent and no one else in double digits, but this survey tells us very little about who will win. First, of course, internal polls are to be taken with grains of salt; second, the poll is at least five weeks old and was conducted before most of the race’s campaigning and advertising took place. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after Susan Wright, the Trump-endorsed candidate, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/07/27/jake-ellzey-leading-trump-backed-susan-wright-in-race-to-replace-the-late-ron-wright-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost</a> what was effectively a Republican primary in Texas’s 6th Congressional District last week, the political stakes are high for Trump in this race. If Carey loses, it will raise questions about whether Trump’s influence over the GOP has diminished since leaving office. It won’t answer those questions, though. Two Trump losses in a row would indeed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be unusual</a>, but it would not yet be proof that his endorsement has lost its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-looked-at-hundreds-of-endorsements-heres-who-republicans-are-listening-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictive power</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even if Trump’s influence is on the decline, it might not be for the reason you might assume. A Carey loss <em>could</em> signal that Republican voters are ready to move on from Trump — or it could mean simply that other Republican leaders have agency, too. Whether because Trump now lacks the awesome power of the presidency or simply the ability to angrily tweet, some Republican politicians and organizations clearly feel comfortable expressing a different preference from him in both Ohio and Texas. And since we know that <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/elite_cues_and_political_decision_making.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elite cues can shape public opinion</a>, this may give voters permission to break from Trump; more cynically, it might just be the case that when Republican financiers are willing to spend money against a Trump-endorsed candidate, he or she is likelier to lose. On the flip side, if Carey wins in the face of so much coordinated opposition, it would be a strong signal that Trump (who often endorses candidates who are shoo-ins in an apparent attempt to pad his record) is still top dog in the GOP. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So our advice for following the primaries in both the Ohio 11th and Ohio 15th is not to read too much into the results. The 2022 election cycle is just barely underway, and there are dozens of Democratic and Republican primaries (both special and regular) that will give us a lot more data soon enough. It won’t be long until we know a lot more about the direction each party is headed.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): Initially, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/03/republicans-condemned-trump-after-capitol-attack-now-they-are-opening-door-him-future-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both Republican and Democratic lawmakers</a> condemned the mob of Trump supporters that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But those days are long gone.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A House-led investigation into <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jan-select-committee-meet-steps-move-subpoenas/story?id=79118740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what happened that day is currently underway</a> in the form of a select committee, but it is for all intents and purposes a Democratic-led effort. (In May, Senate Republicans <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000524897/senate-republicans-block-plan-for-independent-commission-on-jan-6-capitol-riot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked the creation of a bipartisan, independent commission</a> to investigate what happened, and although the select committee does have two Republicans on it, House Republicans have otherwise refused to cooperate following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/21/pelosi-vetoes-banks-jordan-for-jan-6-select-committee-500424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejection of two</a> of House Minority Leader <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/21/pelosi-vetoes-banks-jordan-for-jan-6-select-committee-500424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin McCarthy’s picks for the committee</a>, Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Understanding what happened on Jan. 6 and making sure that it doesn’t happen again — the guiding principle behind the 9/11 Commission, which <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/26/999930573/why-a-9-11-commission-is-popular-but-may-not-happen-for-the-jan-6-capitol-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this investigation was originally modeled on</a> — is unlikely. Let’s unpack what this says about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-danger-is-american-democracy-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the health of our democracy</a> and the power of political investigations in our deeply politicized era.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, let’s talk about democracy. The Republican Party has increasingly moved in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/in-americas-uncivil-war-republicans-are-the-aggressors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an anti-democratic, illiberal direction</a>. Take this 2020 report from <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/democracy-maybe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Democracy Fund’s Voter Study Group</a>. It found that a third of Americans had supported authoritarian ideas at some point in the previous three years, but as the chart below shows, Republicans were more likely than Democrats and independents to support unilateral action on every scenario asked about.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="1190" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/chat.JAN-6COMMITTEE-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/chat.JAN-6COMMITTEE-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/chat.JAN-6COMMITTEE-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/chat.JAN-6COMMITTEE-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">How does this growing disconnect between Democrats and Republicans factor into investigating an attack on democracy?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/kaleigh-rogers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleigh Rogers</a>, tech and politics reporter):<strong> </strong>The issue here is that you cannot divorce the insurrection from politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Individuals who have been charged for participating in the attack have repeatedly stated that they did so <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2021/02/10/trump-blamed-capitol-riot-some-who-were-arrested/4361411001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because former President Donald Trump encouraged them</a>. Trump’s role in this is hard to deny, so naturally any attempt to peel back the layers may result in the former leader of the Republican Party looking not so great. As such, many Republican lawmakers aren’t interested in taking on this investigation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, elections analyst):<strong> </strong>+1 to that, Kaleigh.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/covid-19-cases-rising-americans-thoughts-steps-fivethirtyeight-79188933</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Republican voters also don’t really <em>want</em> to investigate what happened. According to <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us05272021_ussb63.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent Quinnipiac poll</a>, 74 percent of Republicans believed “too much is being made of the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6th and it is time to move on”; only 18 percent thought it “was an attack on democracy that should never be forgotten.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter):<strong> </strong>And no matter what Pelosi does, most Republicans are going to view any probe into Jan. 6 as inherently partisan — despite <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/27/kinzinger-cheney-republican-leaders-jan-6-hearing-500847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming</a> also being part of the committee. (They’re <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/us/politics/insurrection-committee-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely to sway pro-Trump Republicans</a> to believe the committee’s findings, given that they’ve been so outspoken in their criticism of Trump.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s important to remember, though, that Democrats are in a difficult position here. Their initial attempt to create a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate what happened was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-commission-bill-capitol-riot-senate-republicans-block/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot down by Senate Republicans</a> — many of whom claimed that even that investigation would be too politically motivated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>Republicans seem to have been strategic in their opposition to a 9/11 Commission-type investigation. Now, they can <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/january-6-republicans-trump/2021/07/27/79a29e38-eef4-11eb-bf80-e3877d9c5f06_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chalk the whole thing up to a partisan witch hunt</a> and discredit it. Had they agreed to an independent commission, that would’ve been a lot harder to do.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>The space that investigations have come to occupy in Congress is interesting. NPR published a piece in May that argued that even an independent commission <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/26/999930573/why-a-9-11-commission-is-popular-but-may-not-happen-for-the-jan-6-capitol-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was always going to be a hard sell for Republicans</a> given that even the independent 9/11 Commission carried a lot of political risk for Republicans. That commission, held just months before the 2004 presidential election, charged that the Bush administration had been underprepared for the terrorist attacks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It goes back to the point Kaleigh<strong> </strong>made earlier — you can’t separate the politics from this, and Republican lawmakers and voters just don’t seem interested in engaging with what happened on Jan. 6. They’re either convinced it wasn’t a big deal and/or are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/republican-reaction-january-6-probe/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more interested in the 2022 midterm elections</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Is <em>not</em> participating in the investigation a risky move for Republicans, though?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I don’t think non-participation will impact Republicans politically. And that’s largely because most Republican voters want to move on. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A Morning Consult poll from June found that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/06/28/capitol-riots-six-months-later-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority of Republicans</a> (68 percent) believed the attack on Jan. 6 has received too much attention. This compares to just 23 percent of Democrats who felt the same way. Republicans were also far less likely than all voters (17 percent versus 47 percent) to think the rioters were representative of the GOP. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the flip side, I have seen the argument that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/29/republicans-would-only-hurt-themselves-by-not-participating-pelosis-jan-6-select-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans benefit by participating in the commission</a> — even if they’re 100 percent loyal to Trump — because it gives the GOP a means to act as Trump’s defense counsel. It also would allow members to ask witnesses their own questions and make their own requests for lines of questioning. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>I wonder if that’s a risk Republicans were worried about, Sarah, given how they’ve responded to the investigation. I expected them to largely ignore it, but they’ve aggressively criticized it, and so have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/hannity-january-6-commission-donald-trump-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing news pundits</a>. Fox News personalities Tucker Carlson, Laura<strong> </strong>Ingraham and Sean Hannity have all gone hard <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1420209713644331009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">against the testimony of Capitol Police officers</a> and have made a concerted effort to <a href="https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1420180649395302404?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame these hearings in a particular way</a>, rather than just brushing them off.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>There’s also the way they’ve tried to shift the blame for what happened on Jan. 6 to Democrats. I’m thinking of a popular line of attack among Republicans: the false claim that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/us/insurrection-pelosi-claims-fact-check.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pelosi didn’t do enough to secure the Capitol</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>There’s also been <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/false-equivalency-black-lives-matter-capitol-siege-experts/story?id=75251279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of false equivalence and whataboutism</a>, saying this kind of investigation should have happened for some of the vandalism that occurred after and surrounding Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s truly bizarre to see people within the right-wing communities I follow online who typically express support for police now mocking these officers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>Let’s talk about the power of political investigations, given the current polarization of American politics. Historically, political science research has found that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-a-slew-of-new-congressional-investigations-erode-trumps-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigations can significantly weaken presidencies</a>, namely, by driving down a president’s approval rating. But despite the many investigations against Trump during his presidency, his approval rating didn’t really change. And although Trump’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/since-the-capitol-attack-trumps-approval-rating-has-plummeted-at-a-record-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plummeted after Jan. 6</a> — including among Republicans — it <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/01/19/trump-approval-senate-impeachment-conviction-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has largely bounced back</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What, if anything, can this investigation really change in terms of how people view Trump?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m skeptical it’ll do much, largely because Trump still has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/was-attack-our-capitol-murkowski-criticizes-gop-colleagues-opposing-jan-n1268906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a pretty strong hold over the Republican base</a>. Back in May, when Senate Republicans rejected an investigation resembling the 9/11 Commission to investigate the attacks, only <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-73-percent-of-republicans-blame-left-wing-protesters-for-jan-6-attack-just-23-percent-blame-trump-191520343.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">41 percent of Republicans</a> said supporters of Trump who congregated at the Capitol on Jan. 6 bear “some” or “a great deal” of the blame for the ensuing riot. Less than a quarter of Republicans (23 percent) blamed Trump himself, and a majority (52 percent) said he was “not at all” to blame.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Agreed. I think you saw Trump’s approval drop in January because even a lot of Republicans — for example, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and McCarthy — criticized Trump for his role in the attack. And political science research has shown that <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/elite_cues_and_political_decision_making.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elite cues can drive public opinion</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But since then, Republican politicians have had a chance to get their story straight, and maybe reconsider what breaking from Trump meant for their political futures (exhibit A: Cheney), so they have closed ranks again — and their voters have followed suit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if you subscribe to that theory, then having some credible Republicans on an independent commission might have lowered Trump’s numbers again. But with just Cheney and Kinzinger, who are perceived as anti-Trump, on a “Pelosi-led” commission, there are no Republican leaders left to sway Republican voters’ opinions against Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>Honestly, ever since special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, it has seemed as though even independent investigations have gotten politicized, to the point where it is very hard to convince either side to budge.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take the Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/16/hunter-biden-probe-prosecutor-499782" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigation into Hunter Biden’s dealings with China</a>. Republicans think this is a significant investigation and will undoubtedly make hay over whatever the findings are — they <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/senate-republican-continue-hunter-biden-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hard on Hunter in 2020</a> in the lead-up to the election. Democrats think it’s inconsequential since Hunter Biden isn’t an elected official.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are always independents or swing voters who might be open to seeing what these inquiries turn, but it’s hard to find a significant investigation that remains truly un-politicized.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>I <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/the-starr-report-20th-anniversary-trump-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blame the Starr Report</a>, Kaleigh. (That was a four-year, wide-ranging investigation into then-President Bill Clinton, which ultimately resulted in his impeachment.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>Fair! Wayback playback.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>Is there a risk for President Biden or Democrats in this investigation, though? We know from the polls that both Republicans in Congress and Republican voters are ready to move on from the investigation, but what about Democratic voters or independents?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Per that Quinnipiac poll I cited earlier, 84 percent of Democrats believed Jan. 6 “was an attack on democracy that should never be forgotten,” compared with just 12 percent who thought “too much is being made of the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, and it is time to move on”; independents felt the same way, but by a much narrower margin, 54 percent to 42 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Other polls show much of the same thing. Per Morning Consult, support for a congressional investigation into what happened on Jan. 6 <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/27/capitol-riot-panel-probe-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped 11 percentage points among Republicans in the last month</a> — from 45 percent in June to 34 percent last week. Among independents, there was a 13 percentage point drop, with just 52 percent of independent voters saying they supported a congressional probe versus 65 percent in June. Democrats, though, have always been overwhelmingly in favor of investigating what happened that day, with over 80 percent saying they backed an investigation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>It’s interesting that support among independents for an investigation is already so tepid. Seems as if many Americans may just want to move on.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Speaking of the Mueller investigation, it’s also noteworthy that when it originally started in 2017, there was actually <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-politics-of-the-mueller-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty notable support</a> for it among both Democrats and Republicans.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1082" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mehta-MUELLER-POLLS-02.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mehta-MUELLER-POLLS-02.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mehta-MUELLER-POLLS-02.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mehta-MUELLER-POLLS-02.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That, of course, changed over the course of the investigation, but it had more cross-party appeal initially than the current Jan. 6 select committee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>It’s interesting that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/us/insurrection-pelosi-claims-fact-check.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some Republicans who have said</a> they have questions about the attack and the events leading up to it have also blocked the kind of investigation that may have answered those questions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>How do Democrats combat the GOP criticism that the commission isn’t bipartisan?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Having Cheney and Kinzinger on the committee, by default, makes it bipartisan. Of course, since the two have taken some pro-democracy stances as of late — like speaking out against <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/leadership-backing-stefanik-house-republicans-poised-oust-liz/story?id=77601583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the lie that the election was stolen from Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/14/956621191/these-are-the-10-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting to impeach Trump</a> — they might be viewed as out of touch with the current GOP. But, if nothing else, their participation forces the media to describe the findings as bipartisan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And oddly enough, Pelosi’s rejection of Jordan and Banks may have helped build credibility, too. Not only did both vote in January <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/23/pelosi-just-rejected-two-republicans-jan-6-investigation-here-are-three-takeaways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">against certifying Biden’s election victory</a>, but they’re also supporters of the “Big Lie.” Pelosi’s decision not to give them a voice on the commission could help shore up credibility because it saves members from having to deal with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/20/power-up-mccarthy-taps-jim-jordan-3-big-lie-supporters-jan-6-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad-faith attacks about the nature of the violence</a> that occurred.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>McCarthy appointing Banks and Jordan definitely put Pelosi in a difficult position for the reasons you cite, Alex. It’s interesting, though, that she only chose to block Jordan and Banks from being included on the committee, while Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, who also voted against certifying Biden’s election victory, was not barred.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, this move was unprecedented and angered McCarthy to the point that he <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/pelosi-rejects-mccarthy-nominations-banks-jordan-jan-6-commission-1611930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yanked the remaining members</a>. It also put Pelosi in the position of having to appoint Republicans to the committee. Hence why McCarthy has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-calls-cheney-kinzinger-pelosi-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">derided them as “Pelosi Republicans.”</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>As Alex is getting at<strong>, </strong>the media plays a big role here, too. I get the instinct to dismiss Cheney and Kinzinger as not “real” Republicans — I’ve done that myself. But it’s also objectively true that the commission is bipartisan and that there is a wide ideological gulf between Cheney/Kinzinger and the committee’s Democrats. That shouldn’t be dismissed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, what the committee <em>doesn’t</em> have is pro-Trump representation. And I think that’s what people really mean when they say the commission should be “bipartisan.” But as we’ve seen, being pro-Trump is functionally equivalent to acting in bad faith re: Jan. 6.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>One question I want to revisit here — earlier we said there wasn’t much political risk for Republicans in not participating, given that most Republican voters want to move on/aren’t interested in investigating what happened on Jan. 6. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Is it possible that Republicans are overestimating the power of Trump’s influence?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is one data point, but I’m thinking of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-special-election-in-texass-6th-district-will-test-trumps-influence-on-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the special election in Texas’s 6th Congressional District</a> earlier this week. The Trump-endorsed candidate and widow of the late congressman ended up losing by over 6 points. It’s one election — and you know what we say about a sample size of one — but maybe there is less appetite for some of Trump’s most bald-faced lies?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Well, Sarah, I’m not ready to use that election result as evidence for anything just yet. Sure, it could signal a weakening in Trump’s hold over the party now that he’s no longer in office, but we need to wait for more data.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, though, I do think Republicans overestimate Trump’s influence — but it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. I think if Republicans in Congress adopted a united front in favor of an independent commission, at least some Republican voters would follow their cue. But because congressional Republicans think they need to toe Trump’s line, they do so, and public opinion doesn’t move.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>Well, I also don’t know that avoiding a Jan. 6 commission is only about Trump’s influence. He still has a significant hold on the party, to be sure, but there are no absolutes in politics: Eighteen percent of Republicans think Trump shouldn’t have any influence on the direction of the Republican Party, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-poll-trump-republicans-future-ba85f8d2a572c553b621f86e991ee197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July 27 poll from the Associated Press- NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>, and 34 percent think he should have only “a little” influence. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can imagine that there are some GOP voters who just want to put this all behind us, who worry about it making the party look bad or just think the whole thing was overblown, regardless of whether they particularly like Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>That could be true, Kaleigh, but a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/w1um475jkt/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Economist poll</a> from early July implied that non-Trump-voting Republicans weren’t ready to put Jan. 6 behind them. Those who voted for Trump in the 2020 election opposed the commission 69 percent to 17 percent, while Republicans overall opposed it 60 percent to 24 percent. That suggests that the small sample of anti-Trump Republicans are still fairly supportive of the commission.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>It goes back to what you said at the outset, Kaleigh. It’s impossible to separate the politics from the attack at the Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means, though, there can both be a contingency of Republicans who don’t believe what happened on Jan. 6 was a big deal and a contingency who just want to move on because they think it’s bad for them politically. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both things can be true.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But OK, to wrap — what will you be watching as the investigation makes its way forward?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong>: This might be a cop-out answer, but I’m watching how Republicans outside the room react and how Cheney and Kinzinger will work with Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong>: I’ll be watching media coverage of the investigation: how much it receives, and how it is framed (i.e., is it a “bipartisan committee” or is it dismissed from the get-go because it’s not the full-on independent commission?). I’ll also be watching Trump’s favorability ratings, I guess, even though I don’t expect much movement there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Honestly, I’m most interested in the ongoing court cases and investigation into the attack. I wonder if the testimony and evidence shared in Congress will shed any light on who participated, what their motivations were and what they did exactly.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">It’s easy to blame partisanship for everything these days. Including the speed with which COVID-19 is raging through the U.S., causing cases to spike and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-backtracks-masks-guidance-vaccinated-people-schools/story?id=79089396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC guidance to shift</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The delta variant is spreading rapidly in part because around 30 percent of Americans remain entirely unvaccinated. About 60 percent of adults <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are fully vaccinated</a> and another 9 percent are partly vaccinated,<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of July 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> which puts the country just short of — and behind schedule for — President Biden’s <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-biden-aims-for-vaccinating-70-percent-of-adult-americans-by-july-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent goal</a> set for July Fourth.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as we’ve seen for months, Americans’ willingness to get vaccinated can become a proxy for their politics. Republicans are more likely than Democrats and independents to say they won’t get a vaccination. Depending on the poll, somewhere <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/religious-vaccines-covid-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 20 percent</a> to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/v60y11605p/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 percent of Republicans</a> say they won’t get vaccinated, whereas only about 5 percent of Democrats say the same. Independents who are refusing to get the vaccine range from around 10 percent to 25 percent in surveys. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/mysterious-case-2020s-polling-error-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79104379</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But partisanship isn’t the only thing that has shaped Americans’ vaccination status. Unvaccinated Americans tend to be younger, less well-educated and poorer; they are also more likely to be a person of color. The situation we’re in is not just because of politics but also because of access to the vaccine and broader skepticism of the health care system.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Age is an even more significant dividing line for vaccinations than politics is. Older Americans are far more likely to be vaccinated, undoubtedly because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-do-we-get-back-to-normal-fastest-prioritize-access-to-the-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they were prioritized in the vaccination rollout</a> since they’re more at risk from coronavirus infections. About 80 percent of Americans age 65 or older are fully vaccinated, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, compared with about 55 percent of Americans 18 to 64. Within that 18-64 range, the younger the age group, the less likely it is to be vaccinated relative to its share of the population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some degree of skepticism or uncertainty may be playing a role in why young people are not as likely to be vaccinated. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/06/21/young-adults-covid-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC reported in June</a> that from March to May, nearly half of American adults under 40 either were unsure about the vaccine or didn’t plan on getting one. Polls suggest that there may be less skepticism now, as the <a href="https://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PRRI-IFYC-Jul-2021-Vaccine.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Religion Research Institute recently found</a> that the share of Americans under age 50 who were hesitant or opposed to getting the vaccine fell from slightly more than 50 percent in March to 35 percent in June. Still, just under half of that group of 35 percent remained opposed to getting vaccinated in the June survey.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The younger someone is, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/30/most-common-age-among-us-racial-ethnic-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the more likely they are to be a person of color</a>, so it’s also unsurprising that Black and Hispanic Americans have lower vaccination rates than non-Hispanic white Americans. In the <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/v60y11605p/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest weekly survey from The Economist/YouGov</a>, slightly less than half of Black and Hispanic adults reported being fully vaccinated, while more than 60 percent of white adults said they were. And even when you include those who are still in the process of being vaccinated or intend to be vaccinated, a larger share of white Americans than Black or Hispanic Americans are vaccinated, are partly vaccinated or plan to get vaccinated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The lag among people of color isn’t just about an unwillingness to get the jab. The <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-april-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> found in April that significantly more unvaccinated Black and Hispanic adults than white adults didn’t know where or when they could get a vaccine. More fundamentally, unvaccinated people of color were far more likely than white Americans to say they hadn’t gotten the vaccine because they didn’t have enough time or were worried about missing work, <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-june-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to KFF’s June survey</a>. Similarly, PRRI found that Black Americans were slightly more likely than Americans as a whole to say a lack of child care or transportation was a barrier to getting vaccinated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It does seem like more outreach about the relatively minor side effects could pay dividends as well. KFF found in June that 60 percent of Hispanic adults and 55 percent of Black adults were concerned about side effects, slightly more than the 51 percent of white adults who said the same. And slightly more people of color mentioned being wary of getting vaccinated as a reason for not having had the shot, which may have something to do with their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/20/948614857/race-and-the-roots-of-vaccine-skepticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long history of experiencing inequities in the health care system</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are still more complicating factors than just race, age or partisanship. Socioeconomic status is playing a role, too. KFF’s June survey found that about 4 in 5 college graduates had at least one dose of the vaccine, compared with 3 in 5 of those without a degree. The education gap also exists among white Americans, too, as The Economist/YouGov survey showed that around 80 percent of white Americans with a college degree had been fully vaccinated, compared with about 55 percent of those without a degree. In addition, only 52 percent of those making under $50,000 said they were fully vaccinated, compared with 63 percent of those making $50,000 to $100,000 and 72 percent of those making $100,000 or more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, to recap: Americans sure are a complicated bunch. But there’s still hope for getting more people vaccinated. PRRI found that about half of those who were hesitant about getting the vaccine were more likely to get it after hearing that it would help protect human life, help protect the most vulnerable people in their community or allow them to safely visit family and friends. And according to KFF’s June survey, some other changes might also encourage more people to get vaccinated, including implementing vaccine lotteries (already used by some states), using mobile vaccine units in undervaccinated neighborhoods and providing free child care during the vaccination and recovery process.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, we have a long way to go, and many people will get seriously ill before we get there. It’s easy to imagine that only another deadly wave of COVID-19 cases might spur some uncertain Americans <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/07/america-covid-19-vaccine-decline/619474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to get the vaccine</a> — and those who are younger, less affluent or people of color could be more at risk considering they’re more likely to be unvaccinated.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>According to a new <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/outside-covid-19-biden-receives-mixed-approval-ratings">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a>, 63 percent of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of COVID-19, but that’s 9 percentage points lower than the share who approved at the end of March. Meanwhile, Biden’s numbers on other issues were much lower, particularly those on crime, immigration and gun violence. </li><li>In light of Biden’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/09/1014512171/president-biden-defends-decision-to-withdraw-troops-from-afghanistan">decision to withdraw U.S. combat troops</a> from Afghanistan, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/352793/americans-split-whether-afghanistan-war-mistake.aspx">Gallup found</a> that Americans were evenly divided over whether U.S. involvement there — which began in October 2001 under President George W. Bush — was an error in the first place. Forty-seven percent told the pollster the U.S. made a mistake sending military forces into Afghanistan, while 46 percent said it wasn’t a mistake. Americans have usually been more likely to say U.S. involvement wasn’t a mistake, although Gallup found a near-even divide in 2014, too. In the new poll, a majority of Democrats and independents said they thought U.S. involvement was a mistake, while fewer than 3 in 10 Republicans felt the same way.</li><li>As for possible intervention in Haiti, three-fourths of registered voters told <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/564824-poll-75-percent-say-us-should-not-get-involved-after-haitian">The Hill/HarrisX</a> that the U.S. should not get involved following <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57762246">the assassination</a> of the Caribbean nation’s president, Jovenel Moïse, earlier this month. Biden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-government-and-politics-haiti-42975e871627d635ae3e6d7fdac83f1a">stated he had no intention</a> of sending U.S. troops there even though Haiti’s interim government requested that the U.S. and U.N. send security forces <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombian-suspects-haiti-presidents-killing-arrived-via-dominican-republic-2021-07-09/">to help protect Haiti’s critical infrastructure</a> during this time of political instability.</li><li><a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/27/capitol-riot-panel-probe-polling/">Morning Consult/Politico found</a> that 58 percent of registered voters supported a congressional commission investigation of the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, which comes as the House select committee looking into the insurrection <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/27/1020713409/here-are-the-9-lawmakers-investigating-the-jan-6-capitol-attack">held its first hearing on Tuesday</a>. Support was down from 66 percent in June, however, as only 34 percent of Republicans and 52 percent of independents backed the congressional investigation, down from 45 percent and 65 percent, respectively. </li><li>Nevada recently made waves by passing a law <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/11/politics/nevada-law-caucus-primary/index.html">to establish a presidential primary</a> as opposed to its usual caucus. Per a <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/most-nevada-voters-are-ready-to-move-on-from-caucuses">poll from OH Predictive Insights</a>, Nevadans are very much on board with this change, as 52 percent say they prefer a primary, compared with only 13 percent who prefer the caucus system. In an unusual show of bipartisanship, majorities of both Republican and Democratic voters say they back a primary system. However, the law also sets the primary for the first Tuesday in February starting in 2024, which could put Nevada in conflict with Iowa and New Hampshire over which states lead the presidential nomination process. While Nevada Republicans in the OHPI poll backed the change to a primary, the state party actually opposed the move to avoid upsetting the nomination calendar.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

	</aside><p data-paragraph="main">Cases of COVID-19 are surging in the U.S., largely due to the spread of the delta variant. Earlier this summer, an average of <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases" data-type="URL" data-id="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11,000-15,000 cases per day</a> were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that average is now surpassing 60,000 per day. The federal government and some states have started taking measures to try to increase vaccination rates, particularly among public employees and health care workers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It’s official: For only the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/governor-recall-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth time in U.S. history</a>, a state will hold an election on whether to recall its governor midterm. The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/california-voters-should-start-preparing-for-a-recall-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-expected</a> gubernatorial recall election in California is set for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-01/california-governor-newsom-recall-election-set-for-september" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept. 14</a>, and <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/statewide-elections/2021-recall/certified-list.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 candidates</a> (not including the governor himself, Democrat Gavin Newsom) have officially qualified to run. But perhaps the most intriguing development in the race has come in recent polling. After the recall looked <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/californias-gavin-newsom-will-likely-face-a-recall-election-but-hell-probably-survive-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncompetitive for months</a>, evidence has emerged that the race is tightening.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Until last week, there had been no new polls of the recall election in about a month. But since then, we’ve gotten two — and both showed Newsom in danger of being recalled. First, an <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/california-voters-split-on-recalling-governor-newsom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College/Nexstar Media</a> survey found that 48 percent of registered voters in California wanted to keep Newsom in office, while 43 percent wanted to recall him. Then, a poll from the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-27/likely-california-voters-now-almost-evenly-split-on-newsom-recall-poll-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of California, Berkeley, Institute of Governmental Studies</a> co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times found that 50 percent of likely recall voters wanted to keep Newsom and 47 percent wanted to oust him. These fresh polls — both within the margin of error — differed markedly from a <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=e3ae1d7e-9d6e-44b2-b1f8-e51c51df9ea2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handful of surveys</a> released in May and June that <a href="https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/ppic-statewide-survey-californians-and-their-government-may-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> the recall effort <a href="https://twitter.com/ChangePolls/status/1414617510901604354?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailing by</a> at least 10 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Who casts a ballot in this unusually timed election could be pivotal. The UC Berkeley IGS/Los Angeles Times poll underscored why: Among registered voters, Republicans were far more likely to say they’d vote than Democrats or independents. Eighty percent of Republican registered voters said they were <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6rz4s037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absolutely certain to vote</a>, compared with only 55 percent of Democrats and about half of independents. As such, <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/96k2v40r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely voters</a> were opposed to removing Newsom by only 3 points, while the spread was much wider among all registered voters — 51 percent were opposed to removing him compared with just 36 percent in favor (in line with the pollster’s findings in <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1m66w3d9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early May</a> and <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8hm883bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late January</a>). In fact, Republicans’ enthusiasm for this race is so high that they make up roughly one-third of the survey’s likely electorate, even though they constitute only <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-odd-year-2021/county.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about one-quarter</a> of California’s registered voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Irregularly timed elections, like a gubernatorial recall held in September of an odd year, can produce <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/politics/democrats-republicans-pennsylvania-special-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unexpected results</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/nyregion/ny-democrats-try-to-avoid-upset-in-special-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lopsided electorates</a>. However, there’s one reason why that might not happen in this race: California has <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-extends-mail-ballots-for-all-voters-15964937.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended its pandemic-inspired election-law changes</a> that require ballots to be automatically mailed to all active registered voters through the end of 2021. Mail elections <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-is-no-evidence-that-voting-by-mail-gives-one-party-an-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t inherently help the Democratic Party</a>, but studies have found that they do <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/letting-people-vote-at-home-increases-voter-turnout-heres-proof/2018/01/26/d637b9d2-017a-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase turnout</a>, which could help insulate Newsom from a scenario where only his most fervent opponents bother to cast a ballot.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s tempting to point to COVID-19 <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/07/22/coronavirus-surge-squeezes-newsom-with-california-recall-approaching-1388872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the chief cause</a> for why Newsom is in hot water since the pandemic <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/star-dimmed-californias-newsom-face-recall-74709802" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped galvanize the recall effort</a> in the first place. The highly contagious delta variant has led to an uptick in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/california-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cases of COVID-19</a> in California, and Newsom is now weighing <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-20/possibility-statewide-mask-order-political-challenge-newsom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether to impose statewide restrictions</a>, which could further energize his opposition. (Los Angeles County has already <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/los-angeles-again-requiring-masks-indoors-starting-saturday-amid-covid-spike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinstated an indoor mask mandate</a>.) The governor has also had disputes with teachers unions and school administrators over the <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/01/28/newsom-california-schools-wont-reopen-if-we-wait-for-the-perfect-1360877" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reopening of schools</a>, and many Californians are still frustrated by the state’s continually changing <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article249023830.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination-distribution plan</a>. Yet Newsom’s handling of the pandemic might not be his biggest liability. A slightly greater share of likely voters in the Berkeley poll agreed with the statement that Newsom should be recalled “because he has failed to adequately address many of the state’s longstanding problems,” such as homelessness, income inequality and wildfires (48 percent), than agreed with the statement that he should be recalled “because he greatly overstepped his authority as governor when responding to the COVID-19 pandemic” (44 percent).<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference was even greater among registered voters, 42 percent versus 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, California voters may be displeased with conditions related to COVID-19, but other problems in the state are troubling them, too. Thus, the pandemic may not be solely responsible for what we’ve seen in the polls.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For his part, Newsom is painting the recall as a contest between him and a rash of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-16/gavin-newsom-recall-election-trump-covid-19-campaigns-republicans-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-supporting Republicans</a> (for instance, the governor has tried to <a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/politics/2021/07/27/newsom-casts-political-blame-in-new-california-vaccine-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pin the growing number of COVID-19 cases on Republicans and conservative media</a> and their misinformation on vaccines). But this strategy may be complicated by a judge’s ruling on July 12 that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-12/newsom-wont-get-democrat-beside-his-name-on-recall-ballot-says-judge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsom won’t be listed as a Democrat</a> on the official recall ballot.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a law that &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB151#:~:text=SB%20151%2C%20Umberg.,Elections.&amp;amp;text=This%20bill%20would%20authorize%20an,the%20statement%20of%20party%20preference." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Newsom himself signed&lt;/a&gt; in October 2019, elected officials subject to a recall must ask for their party to be listed on the ballot within seven days of the start of the recall effort — long before anyone knows whether the recall will actually make the ballot. (In Newsom’s case, the deadline was more than 16 months ago.) Newsom filed a lawsuit in late June, claiming that the public interest in knowing his party outweighed the arbitrarily early deadline, but he lost the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>17</sup></a> Most Californians are probably aware that Newsom is a Democrat, but having his party affiliation spelled out in black and white <a href="https://gallatindemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TeamsWithoutUniformsPaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have helped him on the margins</a> in this very blue state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent developments in the recall haven’t been all bad news for Newsom. Crucially, his efforts to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-03-22/democrats-newsom-recall-challenger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discourage other prominent Democrats from running in the recall</a> seem to have paid off. Of the 46 candidates running to replace him, only nine are Democrats — and none are established politicians. By contrast, 24 Republican candidates are in the race, as well as two Green Party candidates, one Libertarian Party candidate and 10 independents. This means that, in the event that Newsom <em>is</em> recalled, it’s very likely a Republican will win the race to replace him (the second question on the recall ballot). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If California does get a new governor, which Republican is it likely to be? According to both recent polls, conservative talk-radio host Larry Elder has the most support (16 percent per Emerson, 18 percent per Berkeley). Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and perennial candidate John Cox make up the second tier, each receiving 6 percent in the Emerson survey and 10 percent in the Berkeley poll. Reality-TV star Caitlyn Jenner, despite getting <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jenner-defends-australia-trip-california-recall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of media coverage</a>, barely registered in either poll. At this point, though, the race is still very fluid, with the plurality of voters (53 percent per Emerson, 40 percent per Berkeley) still undecided on who should replace Newsom. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, of course, that question will only come into play if Newsom is recalled. The latest polls suggest real danger for Newsom, but he’s still not in the same troubled territory Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was back in 2003, when Californians <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2003&amp;fips=6&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted by 11 points</a> to recall him from office. Surveys conducted around the same time in that election cycle found Davis in very bad shape: The <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Bustamante-and-actor-take-lead-in-state-poll-2595709.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote</a> to recall him <a href="https://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/survey/S_803MBS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led by</a> about 20 points or more <a href="http://i.timeinc.net/time/covers/1101030818/poll/images/poll1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in most surveys</a>, and his approval rating <a href="https://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/survey/S_803MBS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was in the 20s</a>. By comparison, Californians are more inclined to retain Newsom, and they tend to approve of his job performance somewhat more than they disapprove (among registered voters, the Emerson and Berkeley polls put Newsom’s job approval at about 50 percent and disapproval at 42 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Newsom clearly has his work cut out to raise Democratic interest in the recall vote. And if he fails on that front, an unusual off-year electorate might be just Republican-leaning enough to boot him out of office.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This is the latest edition of our column that excavates the origins of public figures’ factually dubious comments. We explain what their claims are referring to, the evidence (or lack thereof) behind them and where they sprang from in the first place.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Who said what …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">On July 19, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia <a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1417096540074565636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted the following</a>: “The controversial #COVID19 vaccines should not be forced on our military for a virus that is not dangerous for non-obese people and those under 65. With 6,000 vax related deaths and many concerning side effects reported, the vax should be a choice not a mandate for everyone.” Because her post contained several false statements, Twitter labeled it “misleading” and issued a 12-hour ban on her account for violating the service’s <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 misleading information policy.</a> Greene’s claims that there have been 6,000 “vax related” deaths and that COVID-19 is “not dangerous” for people who aren’t obese or over 65 are both inaccurate. Among the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 163 million people</a> who have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S., <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6,207 deaths</a><a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dec. 14, 2020, through July 19, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> have been reported according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no evidence those were “vax related deaths.” And while obesity and old age are risk factors for COVID-19, they are not the only ones, and the disease is still dangerous for people without those risk factors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<h2><strong>Some background …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since the earliest days of the pandemic, researchers have been studying which kinds of comorbidities can make someone more likely to have a severe case of COVID-19 that could lead to hospitalization or death. After a year and a half, it’s clear obesity or old age does make someone more susceptible. But so do lots of other conditions. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CDC lists 17 categories</a>, including cancer, pregnancy and chronic lung diseases. But otherwise healthy people can also become seriously ill from COVID-19, not to mention die from it. To claim that the novel coronavirus is “not dangerous” for anyone who isn’t obese or over 65 is wildly inaccurate. And focusing on obesity as though it were the only risk factor for severe COVID-19 is a trend among right-wing communities that combines two parallel threads in online subcultures: the <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/05/anti-vaxxers-have-a-dangerous-theory-called-natural-immunity-now-its-going-mainstream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-vax community’s belief</a> that a healthy lifestyle and one’s natural immune system are as effective as vaccination in preventing disease and the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing troll culture’s long fixation</a> on fat shaming. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?513570-1/representative-marjorie-taylor-greene-holds-news-conference-temporary-twitter-suspension" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press conference about the Twitter ban</a>, Greene tried to clarify her statement, saying she “was talking about the highest amount of deaths, the highest risk factor” and that “78 percent of people that were hospitalized and died were obese.” That stat is based on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/covid-cdc-study-finds-roughly-78percent-of-people-hospitalized-were-overweight-or-obese.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a CDC study from March</a>, but it comes with some caveats. First, this figure includes people who are considered obese <em>and</em> people who are considered overweight. Second, 73.6 percent of Americans age 20 or over are considered overweight or obese, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the CDC</a>. While the numbers for people with obesity are still higher among COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized, needed a ventilator or died, the stat Greene cited is a bit like surveying COVID-19 cases at a sorority house and finding that 100 percent of the hospitalizations occurred among women. And that’s not even taking into account that the measurement used to diagnose obesity — the body mass index — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bmi-is-a-terrible-measure-of-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is flawed, at best</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/mysterious-case-2020s-polling-error-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79104379</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">There is no denying that obesity is a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 infections. Compared with people with a healthy weight, obese people who contract COVID-19 are 113 percent more likely to be hospitalized, 74 percent more likely to be put in intensive care and 48 percent more likely to die, according to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.13128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a meta-analysis published in August</a> in the journal Obesity Reviews<em>. </em>But obesity is not the only, or even necessarily the highest, risk factor for more severe COVID-19 infections. Smokers, for instance, have a 40 to 50 percent higher risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19 compared with nonsmokers, according <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2021-who-supports-people-quitting-tobacco-to-reduce-their-risk-of-severe-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the World Health Organization</a>. People diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease who contract COVID-19 have a 30 percent higher risk of death than people without Parkinson’s, according to <a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.28325" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a University of Iowa study published in September</a>. And pregnant women who get COVID-19 are 70 percent more likely to die than those who aren’t pregnant, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6944e3.htm?s_cid=mm6944e3_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the CDC</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Greene didn’t tweet that people who don’t smoke, aren’t pregnant or don’t have Parkinson’s disease have nothing to fear from COVID-19. She specifically singled out obesity, something many right-wing communities online have done since the start of the pandemic. </p>



<h2><strong>Where the comment came from …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">A common refrain in this online community is that the only people at risk for severe COVID-19 infections are those who are considered either overweight or obese. Occasionally, other medical risk factors are mentioned, but there seems to be a particular focus on obesity. On patriots.win, a forum for supporters of former President Donald Trump, there are dozens of posts about obesity being a risk factor for COVID-19, many of which are scrutinizing news reports of deaths to give an armchair diagnosis of the victims. “The vaccine would not have saved her son. He’s obese and looks unhealthy,” said one post sharing a screengrab of a Daily Mail article about an Alabama woman who regretted not having her son, who died of COVID-19, vaccinated. “Vulnerable remain vulnerable even with vaccine,” the post claims.  </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">After the CDC published its finding that 78 percent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were considered overweight or obese, this statistic became a frequent (and often misquoted) datapoint in right-wing and anti-vax communities online. In May, Jordan Sather, a QAnon influencer, shared a video with his tens of thousands of followers on the messaging app Telegram of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio promoting vaccinations. Many responded with inaccurate quips about COVID-19 affecting only obese people. “They know that obese was 90% of the reason people were in the hospital for COVID?! I guess they don’t believe in the science,” one follower wrote. “Aren’t 80 percent of all C19 deaths from obese people? Hmmm…” wrote another. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a long history of right-wing groups fat-shaming people online. To wit: <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An appreciable contingent of subscribers</a> to the now-banned subreddit r/fatpeoplehate — which existed only to mock and criticize people who are overweight in the most vitriolic terms possible — moved over to the now-also-banned subreddit r/The_Donald, where Trump supporters posted right-wing memes and discussions. Of course, fat-shaming online is not limited to right-wing trolls. It’s incredibly widespread, and many on the left are just as guilty of it — consider House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/you-enjoyed-nancy-pelosi-calling-donald-trump-obese-because-you-ncna1210911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly fat-shaming</a> Trump on live television, or the droves of internet users who have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/covid-vaccine-prioritization-already-hard-don-t-make-it-worse-ncna1255408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized measures</a> to prioritize obese people for the COVID-19 vaccine, or reward vaccination with free goodies <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/krispy-kreme-free-doughnut-vaccine/2021/03/25/3662706e-8d72-11eb-a6bd-0eb91c03305a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Krispy Kreme doughnuts</a>. But it does hold a particularly pernicious and prevalent role in right-wing communities online. The fixation on obesity as if it were the only, or most important, risk factor for severe COVID-19 infections is just the latest in right-wing trolls’ longstanding tradition of attacking overweight people online. </p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): With <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/covid-delta-variant-surge/?id=79058271" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the delta variant of the coronavirus surging</a> in the U.S. and COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations once again on the rise, there is <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/07/im-sorry-but-its-too-late-alabama-doctor-on-treating-unvaccinated-dying-covid-patients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a renewed sense of urgency</a> that people get vaccinated — as the rate of vaccination <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has steadily ticked down since April</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those who aren’t vaccinated <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are bearing the brunt of this latest COVID-19 surge</a>, as states with low vaccination rates, like Arkansas, Louisiana and Florida, have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the worst hit areas</a>. Given that states with low vaccination rates often skew Republican, it has meant that some Republican leaders in those states have undertaken a sudden reversal <a href="https://www.axios.com/republicans-coronavirus-vaccines-resistance-trump-a02544f7-c3ee-443a-a2f7-ab9c83e86c98.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in how they talk about vaccination</a>. Former White House press secretary and Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Sarah Huckabee Sanders had previously kept a low profile on her vaccination status, but on Sunday she penned an editorial <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/jul/25/the-reasoning-behind-getting-vaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urging fellow Arkansans to join her in getting vaccinated</a>. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_f569bf58-e970-11eb-8456-7ba1aef698cd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received his first shot of the vaccine</a> earlier this month. Even the biggest on-air talents at Fox News, a network whose coverage of the vaccine has often been critical, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/business/media/fox-news-covid-vaccines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed for vaccination</a> in recent weeks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The question is: Is any of this enough to stop yet another deadly spike in the pandemic? To unpack this, let’s talk about what we know about people who are still unvaccinated, what the science says about vaccination and whether stronger messaging can make a difference.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, what do we know about people who are not yet vaccinated?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/Health/video/people-hesitant-trust-covid-19-vaccine-74659883</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): A poll conducted in mid-May by the <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-profile-of-the-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> found the most common demographic profiles of unvaccinated Americans. Forty-one percent of this group was 30-to-49 years old, 49 percent identified as Republican (compared to 29 percent who identified as Democrats), 56 percent were white, 80 percent were without a college degree,<strong> </strong>56 percent were based in the suburbs and, surprisingly, 76 percent were insured. The study also found that unvaccinated Americans were more likely to be low-income than high-income.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But of the unvaccinated group, there was a stark contrast between people who said they would “definitely not” get the vaccine versus those who plan to “wait and see”: The former group was mostly white (70 percent) and Republican (67 percent), and a plurality (48 percent) was 30-to-49 years old. The latter group, meanwhile, was a bit more diverse; 39 percent of the “wait and see” contingent were Democrats, and 41 percent were Republicans. Further, 22 percent of the hesitant group were Black adults, and 20 percent were Hispanic adults. Seventy-two percent of respondents in this group were between the ages of 18 and 49. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/maggie-koerth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie Koerth</a>, senior science writer):<strong> </strong>We also know that most people made their decisions months before the vaccine was available and have stuck to those choices. That same KFF polling found that only <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/concerns/concerns/messages/information#intentions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in five people</a> said they were hesitant or definitely not going to get the vaccine back in January and have now gotten vaccinated.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>There is also a geographic element to this.<strong> </strong>For example, researchers have found that vaccination rates are lagging in Southern states. An analysis by <a href="http://www.vaccinetracking.us/analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers at Georgetown University</a> identified 30 clusters of counties nationwide with low vaccination rates and larger populations. The <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-delta-variant-risk-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five most significant</a> of these clusters were in the South and Midwest and included portions of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and New Mexico. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst):<strong> </strong>To Alex’s point about the “won’t get vaccinated” group being particularly likely to be Republican, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/1aaz80mjhy/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Economist/YouGov’s weekly poll</a> has found that since April, the share of adult Republicans who say they won’t get vaccinated hasn’t really budged — roughly 25 percent to 33 percent say each week that they “will not get vaccinated.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is in line with polls from Democratic-aligned firms <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/global-strategy-group-gbao-navigator-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Strategy Group/GBAO (Navigator Research)</a> that have repeatedly found since January that the share of Republican registered voters who said they’re very unlikely to get the vaccine <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Navigator-Toplines-07.20.2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is about 30 percent</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>In June, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/01/unvaccinated-americans-reasons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> conducted a poll asking unvaccinated Americans <em>why </em>they weren’t getting the vaccine. They found that the biggest reason was a lack of trust in the vaccine development process (26 percent of respondents), followed by concern over its safety/side effects (23 percent) and conspiracies theories and/or mistrust of drug companies and the government (10 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>There have been a <a href="https://time.com/5957222/covid-vaccine-side-effects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lot of stories</a> about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/they-claimed-the-covid-vaccine-made-them-sick-and-went-viral/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people having negative reactions</a> to the vaccine, so I can see why concern about potential side effects might have dampened interest in getting vaccinated. And perhaps that is partly why younger age groups have been slow to catch up when it comes to the vaccine — if you’re worried about making ends meet, getting sick and missing work might put you off from seeking out the vaccine. After all, those making less money are also <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vjfvegistz/20210715_yahoo_vaccine_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to have gotten the vaccine</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth: </strong>Another thing that really stood out to me in the KFF polling, and that I haven’t seen discussed a lot, is that of the people who have yet to get vaccinated … a lot of them don’t really know HOW. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A full 42 percent of unvaccinated Hispanic adults said <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/concerns/concerns/messages/messages/messages/messages/information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they didn’t know whether they were eligible</a> — and 29 percent didn’t know where to go if they did want a vaccine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>I was going to say, Maggie, vaccine access is still a really big issue. A <a href="http://unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Religion Research Institute survey</a> conducted in June found that younger Americans and Black and Hispanic Americans are disproportionately likely to face barriers to vaccine access — like having the time to get vaccinated or reliable transportation to a vaccination site.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It seems as if when discussing the unvaccinated there are two groups: 1) Those who refuse to even consider getting vaccinated; and 2) those who just aren’t sure or have concerns about getting vaccinated. Does that seem right? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I think so, Sarah. Among that second group, there is polling that shows that financial incentives, along with employers encouraging employees to get vaccinated, can increase people’s willingness to get vaccinated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Per Morning Consult, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/05/13/covid-19-vaccine-incentives-penalties-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43 percent of unvaccinated U.S. adults</a> would “definitely” or “probably” get a COVID-19 shot if they received a small financial incentive, such as a $50 savings bond. And if the government offered a $1,000 savings bond, 57 percent of unvaccinated adults said they would be more likely to get inoculated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the KFF poll found that <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/press-release/workers-are-more-likely-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-when-their-employers-encourage-it-and-provide-paid-sick-leave-though-most-workers-dont-want-their-employers-to-require-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">73 percent of workers</a> whose employers encouraged a vaccine and 75 percent whose employers offered paid time off to do so have received at least one dose.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth: </strong>Honestly, <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I think the breakdown might be even more fragmented than that.</a> First, you have the people who absolutely won’t consider vaccination (some of whom have political reasons, some of whom have medical reasons, some both) and then you have the people who would consider vaccination but just haven’t gotten the shot yet. Those people’s reasons fall into multiple buckets though, too — medical concerns, access concerns and then concerns that are largely about power and trust in institutions, such as the government or pharmaceutical companies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It also looks like most people who are unvaccinated still have more than one reason for why they aren’t. It’s a lot of overlapping circles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that doesn’t even address the (very small) group of people who are still like, “Oh I mean to do that ASAP,” but just haven’t. It’s like 3 percent. But they’re out there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>There really are a lot of different reasons for why Americans are unvaccinated. But as we mentioned at the outset, the biggest distinction might still be between those who say they are hesitant about getting vaccinated and those who refuse to even consider getting vaccinated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to PRRI’s June survey, vaccine holdouts are a pretty small portion of the population — 13 percent, although it’s important to reiterate that is a fairly steadfast group; that number is essentially unchanged from what PRRI found in March (14 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good news here, though, is that the group of holdouts isn’t really growing. As more Americans get vaccinated, the share of Americans who are hesitant about getting vaccinated ticks down. Just 15 percent of Americans are hesitant versus 28 percent in March.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth: </strong>That’s important because what we’re learning is that you can take the “wait and see” people at their word. If you’re tempted to write that off as a euphemism for “I don’t wanna but I don’t want to say that,” well, some of those people are really coming back and getting vaccinated after they waited and saw.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>Exactly, Maggie. The reasons <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/24/us/covid-vaccine-hesitant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people aren’t vaccinated, or just now getting vaccinated</a>, are really, really complicated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But OK, let’s talk about vaccination. The science isn’t really changing — <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccines are effective in preventing severe cases of COVID-19</a>. But vaccination rates have still largely dropped off since April, and many parts of the county are nowhere near hitting <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/05/1013080128/as-covid-vaccinations-slow-parts-of-the-u-s-remain-far-behind-70-goal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s goal of having 70 percent of the population receive at least one dose</a> by the Fourth of July. Why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth: </strong>Well, I think one of the important things that all that polling data is telling us is that the WHY is not (or at least not purely) <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/07/america-covid-19-vaccine-decline/619474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a political thing</a>. I’m seeing a tendency to make these very political assumptions about people who aren’t yet vaccinated. But if you look at what they are telling us about themselves … politics is part of the motivation for some — but not all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So there’s the actual polarization and anti-establishment sentiment driving vaccine refusal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But then there is the polarization of assumptions about what is driving vaccine refusal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And both are happening simultaneously.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/year-karaoke-fivethirtyeight-77653577</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>The New York Times had a really interesting article looking at how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/us/covid-vaccine-immunity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">young adults were one of the biggest barriers to herd immunity</a>. There wasn’t a clear-cut reason as to why, though things like difficulty in convincing young people they should be vaccinated or even misinformation surrounding the shot’s effect on fertility among that generation were floated as two potential culprits.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Looking over the polling and <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the actual vaccination data</a>, it’s clear that the share of older adults who are vaccinated is much higher, which makes sense. They are the ones most immediately in danger of dying from COVID-19, and as such <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-do-we-get-back-to-normal-fastest-prioritize-access-to-the-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were prioritized in the vaccine rollout process</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The problem for younger Americans is that as the country reopens, there may be less of an incentive for them to get the vaccine, especially given some of the barriers to access we discussed. Unfortunately, it might take another wave to spur some of those fence-sitters to get the vaccine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth: </strong>That’s a really good point, Geoffrey. One of the things that’s come up with the testing on kids younger than 12 is that <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/pfizer-lower-vaccine-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you have to adjust the dosage</a>. Not just because smaller people need a different dosage than adults, but also since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/us/politics/covid-vaccine-trials-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their risks are much lower, their side-effect tolerance is different</a>. You’re working with a different risk/benefit calculation here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I mean, there have been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01898-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debates among scientists</a> about <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210506/should-covid-shots-for-teens-go-to-developing-nations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether it even makes sense</a> to get vaccines to little kids in the U.S., given the risk/benefit calculation, vs. getting those vaccines to unvaccinated adults in countries where vaccine access has been more limited. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which is a long way around to saying that, yeah, younger people who are eligible for the vaccine are doing a different calculation in their heads than the elderly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>As we’ve discussed, people’s decision to not get vaccinated is not purely political. How, though, did vaccination become so political? I want us to unpack this a little, as it seems especially important for understanding the vaccine holdouts, who, as we’ve discussed, overwhelmingly skew Republican and white. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>COVID-19 was a partisan issue even before the vaccine rollout. Even during the beginning stages of the pandemic, Republicans were less likely than Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-face-masks-surveys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to want to wear masks</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/29/21345228/liability-shield-mitch-mcconnell-republican-safe-to-work-act-gross-negligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impose business restrictions</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>That’s right. From the very start, Republicans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/07/22/republicans-remain-far-less-likely-than-democrats-to-view-covid-19-as-a-major-threat-to-public-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been less worried about COVID-19</a> than Democrats. That may have been related to a combination of messaging and opposition to government actions to combat the virus (like closing businesses and churches), but they have consistently been less likely <a href="https://morningconsult.com/views-on-the-pandemic/#section-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to view it as a severe health risk</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Religion also plays a factor in this. White evangelical Protestants, who <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make up a sizable part of the GOP</a>, were the most likely to say they wouldn’t get the vaccine out of the religious and racial/ethnic groups PRRI’s survey examined — 24 percent of them said they would refuse to get vaccinated, essentially unchanged since PRRI’s March survey. <a href="https://religionnews.com/2021/05/14/survey-white-evangelicals-trust-fox-news-black-protestants-look-to-mainstream-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Distrust of mainstream media</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/us/covid-vaccine-evangelicals/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governing institutions</a>, which is also high among this group, likely plays into this as well. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth: </strong>I’m curious about something that I wonder if you more-politics people have insight on: How much of the politicization of COVID-19 is a Democratic/Republican thing — that is, former President Donald Trump doesn’t think it’s a big deal, there’s a Democratic backlash to that, a Republican backlash to THAT — and how much is creeping anti-establishment sentiments in the U.S.? To be sure, that still takes on a political character that is heavily tied to the Republican Party, but I do think it exists in a sort of parallel track to Republicans and Democrats fighting against each other.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ve struggled with what to call the sorta “Joe Rogan demographic” of COVID-19/vaccine/mask skeptics. Some are Republicans, but not all. Their shit is political. But not necessarily <em>party</em> political. I haven’t found a lot of polls that ask questions that get at this well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Part of this, Maggie, might have to do with trust in science generally — right after the pandemic started, the Pew Research Center found that Democrats were notably more likely than Republicans to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/05/21/trust-in-medical-scientists-has-grown-in-u-s-but-mainly-among-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust medical scientists</a> — and scientists more generally — to act in the best interests of the public. It’s another partisan component, yes, but it also isn’t wrapped up entirely in Trump-this or that. Here, again, is a question about trust in institutions that have been major players in combating the virus — Republicans <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-health-tracking-poll-september-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tended to have less trust</a> in the Centers for Disease and Control and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has played a key role in advising both the Trump and Biden administrations on how to handle the pandemic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>It’s an interesting question, Maggie. I think you’re onto something. Natalie Jackson of PRRI wrote an article for us earlier this month that found that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extremes-of-the-gop-have-moved-beyond-fox-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether Republicans believed in QAnon or getting vaccinated</a> varied significantly based on their media diets. Republicans who watched Fox News were far more likely to have received at least one dose of the vaccine or would get the vaccine as soon as possible (54 percent) than those who turned to OANN or Newsmax (32 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It does seem as if we’re talking about a very extreme but small-ish slice of the Republican Party that falls into this hardcore anti-COVID-19 stance. Part of the problem, though, is that there haven’t really been many Republican leaders/elites pushing a pro-vaccination message from the outset. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Imagine had Trump decided to get vaccinated in public. Instead, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2020/12/18/trump-absent-as-vice-president-mike-pence-receives-covid-19-vaccine-live-on-camera/?sh=58b4665149bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was then-Vice President Mike Pence who did it</a>, while Trump refused to say whether he’d get vaccinated. (He <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/01/politics/trump-melania-vaccinated-white-house/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since has, but off camera</a>.) We are now seeing some Republicans step forward and urge people to get vaccinated, but it still seems largely confined to more establishment Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Other, more Trumpy Republicans, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-03e6b17b205b18067c05e07b77dc2e04" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</a>, have done so, too. And he’s not the only Republican governor encouraging vaccinations: Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007884087/alabama-governor-coronavirus-unvaccinated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had strong words</a> for unvaccinated people. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I think the jury is still out on whether Republican leaders will continue their highly public encouragements to get vaccinated. Politicians also respond to their bases, and there’s a significant chunk of the GOP base that is pretty anti-COVID-19 vaccine right now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Elites <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/elite-influence-on-public-opinion-in-an-informed-electorate/7A5185F2D31929DC547F735F8F3F9DB5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can lead on public opinion</a>, but recently it’s felt, at times, like the GOP is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-republican-party-isnt-rebranding-after-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more inclined to follow the party base</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I agree with you there, Geoff. It might be too early to say definitively whether various GOP officials’ push for vaccines will <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/25/republicans-unleashed-deadly-vaccine-skepticism-can-they-now-contain-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have any impact on Americans</a> who are hesitant to get vaccinated. I mean, even Trump couldn’t do much. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The CBS News team <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-presidential-encouragement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran an experiment in March</a> testing whether Trump or Biden could influence people’s willingness to get vaccinated. And one big takeaway on the Republican side was that Trump’s encouragement didn’t persuade Republicans who outright said “no,” although he did seem to move some Republicans who were on the fence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>Not to mention, it seems as if there might be yet another backlash brewing, which could complicate this nascent GOP vaccination push. And that is, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/covid-local-officials-across-us-are-starting-to-reimpose-mask-rules-as-delta-variant-takes-hold.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states are considering reinstating mask mandates</a> given the spread of the delta variant. In fact, the CDC recommended on Tuesday that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/health/cdc-masks-indoors-delta-variant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some vaccinated people wear masks indoors</a>. This will likely renew efforts among Republican lawmakers to <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/06/17/more-states-rein-in-governors-emergency-powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limit the emergency powers of governors</a> and/or to limit vaccination mandates that companies and various government agencies have implemented. (Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio is an example of a Republican whose own party <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/ohio-republicans-defy-their-governor-limiting-his-power-manage-pandemic-n1261989" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to limit his power to issue public health orders</a> earlier this year.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth: </strong>I’m working on a story about this, and I’m waiting for the newest data, but at least 15 state legislatures <a href="https://www.networkforphl.org/resources/proposed-limits-on-public-health-authority-dangerous-for-public-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have proposed such laws</a> as of May. It’s probably even more now, and several states have passed these measures. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s interesting about these laws is that they’re both specific — meant to address things people didn’t like about the particular ways the COVID-19 response played out — and often broad. Some could affect emergency powers even in non-pandemic disasters like wildfires and tornadoes, for instance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And some of these laws are ALREADY getting in the way of emergency responses. In Arkansas, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/arkansas-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 36 percent of people are fully vaccinated</a>, cases, hospitalizations and deaths are rapidly rising. But both the governor and local city governments are now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-science-health-arkansas-coronavirus-pandemic-db3b9d141319c5a828d79a44196fe891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevented from instituting masking requirements</a> of any kind. School boards have petitioned the governor and legislator to change the law so that they can require masks in schools. And on Monday, the governor said he’d be meeting with GOP legislators this week to discuss changes like that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I am just not confident Americans will be inclined to go back to staying inside again — even if there’s a major uptick in COVID-19 cases due to the delta variant. We’ve talked a lot about those who are hesitant or vaccine holdouts, but a majority of adults got the vaccine in the U.S. and are ready to get back to normal. An Axios/Ipsos poll from June, for instance, <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-vaccine-july-4-eb4c37de-bac5-4141-a994-bf8ce6322185.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested that far fewer people were willing to self-quarantine or stay inside</a> than last year, even though people were concerned about the delta variant. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> It certainly does seem as if this isn’t the last chapter, by any means, in how the pandemic will play out in the U.S.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (July 28, 2021, 7:46 a.m.): </strong>On Tuesday, Republican state Rep. Jake Ellzey handily defeated longtime GOP activist Susan Wright <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/27/us/elections/results-texas-house-district-6-special-runoff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by nearly 7 percentage points</a> in a special election runoff for control of Texas’s 6th District. With Ellzey and Wright running on nearly identical platforms, the race was largely viewed as a test of former President Donald Trump’s endorsement power — he backed Wright in April, days ahead of the initial blanket primary when Republicans closed out Democrats in the 23-way race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to say what this means for Trump’s endorsement power ahead of the 2022 midterms — it’s one low-turnout special election — but it is a reminder that a Trump-backed candidate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t always a sure thing</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Ideologically, <a href="https://susanwrightforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susan Wright</a> and <a href="https://www.ellzeyfortexas.com/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Ellzey</a> have a lot in common. For starters, the first three priorities on their respective campaign websites are identical: defending the Second Amendment, opposing abortion rights and strengthening the U.S.-Mexico border. Both also claim that President Biden and his administration are promoting immigation among undocumented migrants and, echoing former President Trump’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-election-voter-trust/2020/12/20/00282aa6-407a-11eb-8db8-395dedaaa036_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">false claims of election fraud</a>, call for more restrictive voting laws. Overall, both candidates tout their conservative bona fides as a reason why they should represent Texas’s 6th Congressional District.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Where the two really differ is in their respective endorsements. Ellzey, a state House representative and retired Navy fighter pilot, has the support of former <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1131517827366617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Gov. Rick Perry</a>, who also served as energy secretary under Trump. And Wright, a longtime GOP activist and the widow of Ron Wright, the late congressman of the district <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/08/texas-ron-wright-dies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who died in February</a> after contracting COVID-19, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/28/donald-trump-susan-wright-texas-special-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the backing of Trump</a> himself.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not clear, though, how much that endorsement will matter to voters during Tuesday’s runoff election, when they decide which of the two candidates should represent them in Congress. That’s because Texas’s 6th District — which includes parts of Tarrant, Ellis and Navarro counties — has been trending away from Republicans in recent years. While 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-2020-2016-and-2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried the district by about 17 points</a>, Trump won it by roughly 12 points in 2016 and only 3 points in 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, most indicators lean in Wright’s favor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There hasn’t been a good, independent poll of the district since the initial blanket primary — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-special-election-in-texass-6th-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 23-way race</a> — took place on May 1. In early June, Wright’s campaign <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/84c8faf48625b2f334ce6f14f/files/9dc866c0-2d8b-6bfd-d259-9d8ae6961254/Susan_Wright_for_Congress_IP_Memo_June21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released an internal poll</a> by American Viewpoint that had her leading Ellzey 49 percent to 34 percent, with 11 percent of voters undecided. <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/84c8faf48625b2f334ce6f14f/files/171856ba-1fd9-5980-1fd8-54bf66be22ee/Susan_Wright_for_Congress_IP_Memo_July21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another internal poll</a> by the same firm released by the Wright campaign on Thursday found a similar result: Wright led Ellzey by 10 points, with 12 percent of voters undecided. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">House races are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notoriously hard to poll</a>, and we’d advise you take internal polls with a grain of salt, but Wright did also outperform Ellzey in the May 1 primary. Wright <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/texas-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came in first place</a> with 19.2 percent of the vote compared to Ellzey’s 13.8 percent. And it does appear that Trump’s endorsement played a role in the results. His public statement of support <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/26/texas-congress-special-election-donald-trump-endorsement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came on the second-to-last day</a> of early voting, and per the <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/texas-house/tx-06-runoff-can-fighter-pilot-overcome-trump-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook Political Report’s analysis</a> of election day ballots versus early votes, Wright and Ellzey were essentially tied during the early voting period, but Wright had nearly double the support among voters who cast their ballots on election day — 25 percent to 11 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if Wright has any weakness right now, it’s her paltry fundraising numbers. According to her <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00770420/1527201/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest federal filing</a>, Wright raised $450,668 between April 12 and July 7 — just over one-third of <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00770438/1527490/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellzey’s $1.22 million haul</a>. Ellzey also ended the period with $484,940 cash on hand versus the $164,101 Wright had. But Wright is getting a hefty boost from outside groups, including the Club for Growth and <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00662221/1523174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Action</a>. In late June, the Club for Growth <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/theblast/2021/06/29/#club-growth-launches-tv-ads-susan-wright-tx-6-runo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a $228,000 TV ad buy</a> promoting Wright’s endorsement from Trump that ran on Fox News and satellite TV. On top of that, the group said it planned to spend $150,000 on door-knocking. And in advance of Tuesday’s election, Trump’s Make America Great Action PAC <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00771477/1530268/se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent another $100,000</a> on an ad campaign boost for Wright. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition to Trump, though, Wright has also been bolstered by a number of high-profile Republicans, including Sen. <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/article252102983.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ted Cruz</a> from Texas and Rep. <a href="https://elevate-pac.com/2021/03/26/congresswoman-elise-stefaniks-e-pac-endorses-susan-wright-tx-06-as-rising-star-candidate-for-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elise Stefanik</a> of New York. But that might not matter as much as Trump’s backing because if recent elections and statewide efforts to restrict voting have taught us anything, it’s that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/11/how-republican-party-became-party-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump still rules the GOP</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ahead of the 2022 midterms, Trump has made clear his intentions to get involved in competitive primary races to help Republicans <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tells-republican-donors-hell-help-win-congress-2022-2021-04-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">win back Congress</a> and weed out candidates who <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-influence-looms-gop-recapture-congress-2022/story?id=76348665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are not in lockstep with his views</a>. He issued at least two recent statements of support for Wright, one last week calling her “outstanding” and reiterating she has his “complete and total endorsement,” and another on Monday saying she will “never let you down!” He also <a href="https://twitter.com/SusanWrightTX6/status/1419397692699127810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently participated</a> in a robocall for Wright and held a <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1419421542740635651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tele-rally for Wright</a> yesterday evening, according to The Texas Tribune. Meanwhile, Wright has continued <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1405218863642558464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to tout Trump’s support</a> on her campaign website. And with the backing of the Club for Growth, he two have painted Ellzey as being <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/07/21/rick-perry-says-donald-trump-was-fed-a-bill-of-goods-before-backing-susan-wright-over-jake-ellzey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at odds with Trump</a> and soft on border security. In one mail ad, for instance, Wright’s campaign highlighted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBiR2q0aH1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellzey’s opposition</a> to a spending bill Trump signed in 2018. The former president, for his part, has also <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/trump-effect-susan-wright-jake-ellzey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bragged</a> during a tele-town hall before the May primary that he and the Club for Growth have “never had a loss together.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Various Republicans, including Rep. Joe Barton, who represented the 6th District for <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/11/30/joe-barton-retire-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over three decades</a>, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/07/19/joe-barton-backs-jake-ellzey-over-susan-wright-in-district-6-runoff-for-his-old-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have chided Wright’s team</a> for lying about Ellzey’s record. Ellzey, meanwhile, has also tried to defend himself from such attacks. He recently released a YouTube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9hmyqYJMtc&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showcasing Trump supporters</a> who were backing his campaign and earned the endorsement of Houston-area Rep. Dan Crenshaw, <a href="http://fb.watch/6q15Vcgb13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who commented</a> that Wright was running a “dishonest” campaign. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday’s runoff will undoubtedly be viewed as a test for how Trump-endorsed candidates fare against fellow conservatives who have similar policy plans, but lack the former president’s backing. In the immediate future, though, whoever wins will only have a few months in office before having to start his or her next campaign since the seat is up for reelection again in 2022.<strong> </strong>(It’s not yet clear whether national Democrats will make a play for the seat after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/02/texas-special-election-too-close-to-call-but-gop-on-verge-of-lockout-win-485194" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sitting out the primary</a>; in May, Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez failed to make the runoff after coming <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/texas-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 400 votes</a> behind Ellzey.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond testing Trump’s endorsement power, the race is also notable because Wright’s win could be history-making. Should she prevail, Wright would push the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/15/a-record-number-of-women-are-serving-in-the-117th-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record number</a> of <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-house-representatives-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican women in the House</a> to 32. Moreover, this could be the second time this year where a politician’s wife succeeded him following a tragedy. In Louisiana, Julia Letlow, a Republican, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-to-watch-in-louisianas-two-special-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the special election</a> to replace her late husband Luke, who won his 2020 race but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/29/politics/luke-letlow-died-covid/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died in December</a> after being diagnosed with COVID-19. </p>]]></description>
