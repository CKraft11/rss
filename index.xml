<p data-paragraph="main">The Senate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started out as a toss-up</a> when we launched our forecast in June — and after a summer in which political developments <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly played to Democrats’ favor</a>, there is now clear movement back toward Republicans. The FiveThirtyEight Senate forecast gives Democrats a 58 percent chance of keeping control of the Senate, down from a peak of 71 percent last month.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All forecast odds and polling average figures are as of Thursday, Oct. 20, at 5:30 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How to translate a roughly 60 percent chance into words is a tricky one, since it’s right on the threshold where you might choose to emphasize that one party is ahead <em>or</em> that it’s pretty close to 50-50. Poker players use the term “<a href="https://www.pokervip.com/poker-terms/flip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flip</a>” (short for “coin flip”) when two hands have about an equal chance of winning, even if the chances aren’t <em>exactly</em> equal. Most players would describe <a href="http://twodimes.net/poker/?g=h&amp;b=&amp;d=&amp;h=Ac+Ks%0D%0ATd+Th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this poker hand</a> as a “flip,” for instance, even though the pair of 10s would win 57 percent of the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In politics, the similar term “toss-up” is often applied, although the definition is fuzzy. We’re even inconsistent in how we use it ourselves.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longstanding “official” FiveThirtyEight definition of a toss-up is a race where both parties have less than a 60 percent chance of winning, although in some of the text that the forecast interactive autogenerates, we’ve used a 55 percent threshold instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But let’s get real. If a friend asked me to characterize the Senate race, I’d say “it’s pretty fucking close,” and emphasize that neither party has much of an advantage. Here’s why.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one thing, as of Thursday afternoon, Republicans realized a slight lead (of 0.1 percentage points) in the FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot average</a> for the first time since Aug. 2. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="900" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-711-2.png" alt="A line chart showing voter preferences on the generic ballot, with Republicans leading by one-tenth of a percentage point as of Thursday, Oct. 20, 2022." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-711-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-711-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-711-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="900" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-335-2.png" alt="A line chart showing voter preferences on the generic ballot, with Republicans leading by one-tenth of a percentage point as of Thursday, Oct. 20, 2022." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-335-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-335-2.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-335-2.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Obviously, a lead of a tenth of a percentage point isn’t much. The advantage may have flipped back by the time that you’re reading this. But the tied generic ballot overstates the case for Democrats. That’s because our <em>polling average</em> takes generic ballot polls as they come, which are a combination of polls of likely voters, registered voters and all adults. Our <em>model</em>, however, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takes an additional step</a> and adjusts polls of registered voters and adults to make them more similar to polls of likely voters, which this year have been more favorable to Republicans. So a tie on the generic ballot among all polls translates to a slight GOP lead with the likely voter adjustment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Something else that’s made this year’s forecast hard to convey in plain English is that there are three entirely plausible scenarios: A Republican sweep of Congress, a Democratic sweep or a split Congress (which would more likely involve a Democratic Senate and a GOP House, rather than the other way around). Until recently, a split Congress had the most likely of the three scenarios, though the chances of this outcome were under 50 percent. Now, however, a GOP sweep (41 percent) is more likely than a split (38 percent):</p>

This is a complicated subject; I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>mostly</em> think</a> the model does a good job of accounting for this, and one should keep in mind there’s also the possibility that the polls could be biased <em>against</em> Democrats. But I’m <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not entirely confident</a>, so my mental model is slightly more favorable to the GOP than the FiveThirtyEight forecast itself. It’s worth noting, though, that some of the states where people had been most concerned about the polls being wrong, such as Wisconsin and Ohio, have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown a shift</a> toward the GOP <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in recent weeks</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the main reason why I think of the race for control of the Senate as a toss-up — rather than slightly favoring Democrats — is because there’s been steady movement toward the GOP in our model over the past few weeks. In principle, past movement <em>shouldn’t</em> predict future movement in our forecast and it should instead <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/random-walk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resemble a random walk</a>. (We put a lot of effort in our modeling into trying to minimize <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/autocorrelation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autocorrelation</a>.) This year, though, the forecast has moved in a predictable-seeming way, with a long, slow and steady climb toward Democrats over the summer, and now a consistent shift back toward Republicans.</p>

It’s hard to know whether it reflects the real state of the race or is an artifact of how our model works. The summer produced an unusual streak of favorable developments for Democrats, from the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-republican-outsiders-have-made-their-mark-this-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backlash to the Supreme Court’s decision</a> to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/13/business/us-gas-prices-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower gas prices</a>, to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-trumps-presence-in-the-midterms-is-risky-for-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump’s unhelpful involvement</a> in the midterms, to a string of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-could-the-inflation-reduction-act-save-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislative victories for President Biden</a>. There is, of course, a tendency to see patterns in random noise, but it’s as though the coin really did come up heads for Democrats six or seven times in a row.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From a modeling standpoint, another challenge is that Democrats were defying political gravity. The president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically performs poorly in the midterms</a>. There <em>have been</em> some exceptions and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there <em>is</em> some reason to think this year may be one of them</a>. But the model has been trying to balance polls showing Democrats having a pretty good year against its prior expectation that the electoral environment should be poor for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the election nears, the model relies on its priors less and trusts the polls more, so it was initially skeptical of buying into a post-Dobbs surge for Democrats. Right about the time the model had fully priced in Democrats’ improved polling, though, the news cycle shifted toward a set of stories that were more favorable for Republicans, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/22/23365868/desantis-marthas-vineyard-migrants-midterms-border" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/business/economy/high-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed concerns about inflation</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible to overstate the case for Republican momentum. Midterm elections <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/betting-markets-are-treating-the-midterm-elections-like-its-a-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend not to turn on a dime</a> in the way that presidential elections sometimes do. And there haven’t been any self-evidently important developments in the news cycle in the past week or so. If you’re one of those people who thinks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/18/gas-prices-election-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gas prices are all-determining of election outcomes</a>, they’ve <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even started to come down again slightly</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather, this is more a case of now having more evidence to confirm that the Democrats’ summer polling surge wasn’t sustainable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t mean it was fake: In fact, Democrats had a string of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent special election and ballot referendum results</a> in which they met or exceeded their polling. If you’d held the midterms in late August, I’d have bet heavily on Democrats to win the Senate. It sure would be nice to have another special election or two now, and to see how these polling shifts translate into real results. Polls can sometimes change for reasons that don’t reflect the underlying reality of the race, such as because of <a href="https://moeblog.substack.com/p/pollings-new-problem-partisan-non" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan nonresponse bias</a> or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-some-pollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pollster herding</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And certainly, Democrats have plenty of paths to retain the Senate. Republicans don’t have any sure-fire pickups; Nevada is the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely</a>, and even there, GOP chances are only 53 percent, according to our forecast. Meanwhile, Democrat John Fetterman is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still ahead in polls of Pennsylvania</a>, although his margin over Republican Mehmet Oz has narrowed. The model is likely to be quite sensitive to new polling in Pennsylvania going forward. If Democrats gain a seat there, meaning that the GOP would need to flip two Democratic-held seats to take the chamber, that starts to become a tall order. Nevada, sure, but I’m not sure Republicans would want to count on Herschel Walker in Georgia or Blake Masters in Arizona.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the bottom line is this: If you’d asked me a month ago — or really even a week ago — which party’s position I’d rather be in, I would have said the Democrats. Now, I honestly don’t know.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Meet Luke Bay, a Korean American Californian who once considered himself a “hardcore pro-life, pro-second Amendment, Jesus-loving patriotic Christian.” Years later, the 43-year-old now describes himself as a “patriotic, atheist, socialist” who is pro-choice, supports single-payer healthcare and wants to repeal the Second Amendment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then there’s Syed Fahim, a Pakistani American who lives in Pennsylvania. “I am a rare outlier because I’m a Muslim American, the son of two immigrants and a naturalized citizen myself. But I’m still a strong supporter of the Republican Party,” he told me. While Fahim <em>did</em> vote against former President Donald Trump in 2020, he typically supports GOP candidates in down-ballot races — and plans to stick with that tradition this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Asian American voters like Bay and Fahim are part of a group with growing political power. According to a recent analysis by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/10/12/key-facts-about-asian-american-eligible-voters-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pew Research Center</a>, more than 13.3 million Asian Americans are projected to be eligible to vote in 2022 — up 9 percent from the last midterm cycle in 2018. Under that broad umbrella are a range of ethnic identities with different political leanings: For example, while <a href="https://socialinnovation.ucr.edu/news/2020/08/18/latest-polling-data-shows-indian-americans-continue-lean-towards-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Americans</a> tend to strongly favor Democrats, Vietnamese Americans <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2020/11/10/misled-and-misinformed-why-vietnamese-voters-make-up-the-largest-asian-demographic-in-favor-of-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more evenly divided between Democrats and the GOP</a>. On the whole, however, Asian Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/10/12/key-facts-about-asian-american-eligible-voters-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically lean Democratic</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Most Asian Americans support the Democratic candidate in congressional races" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vgkEY/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="438" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">To that end, I wanted to see what was on the minds of five Asian American voters in the weeks leading up to this year’s midterm elections. Of course, as was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-5-latino-voters-are-thinking-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the case with Latino Americans</a>, I knew that I couldn’t paint this group with a broad brush. These voters’ policy preferences and concerns about the country are varied (as the interviews below show), and survey research backs this up, too. According to the <a href="https://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AAVS-2022-Embargoed-7-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Asian American Voter Survey</a>, Filipino Americans were the group most likely to say that immigration, inflation and health care were “extremely important” in deciding how they’d vote in November, while Indian Americans were the group most likely to prioritize gun control. Vietnamese Americans, meanwhile, were the ethnic group most likely to say foreign policy in Asia was extremely important in deciding how they’d cast a ballot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But these voters’ clout will likely be felt most in just a few states. In its analysis, Pew estimated that in terms of raw numbers, most Asian Americans reside in California, New York, Texas, Hawaii and New Jersey. But their electoral weight varies — for example, in Hawaii, because it’s a small state, Asian American voters make up more than half of eligible voters. And although 32 percent of the country’s Asian American electorate lives in California, Asian Americans make up about 16 percent of the state’s eligible voters there. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Asian Americans are generally a highly politically engaged group. (<a href="https://apiavote.org/policy-and-research/asian-american-voter-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than two-thirds</a> of Asian American registered voters said that they planned to vote this midterm cycle.) But political parties don’t always treat them that way: Per this year’s Asian American Voter Survey, 52 percent of respondents said they haven’t been contacted by the Democratic Party in the past year, while 60 percent say they haven’t been contacted by the Republican Party. One frustration I heard in my conversations, too, was that Asian Americans are often treated as one bloc versus individual, unique communities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Both parties tend to think that Asian American voters vote uniformly,” said Rohan Vaidya, a 24-year-old Indian American living in Texas. “The way this manifests is through political outreach because you can tell that certain outreach isn’t targeted toward the specific concerns of Asian American voters. Instead, it’s based on assumptions about how this massive community as a whole will vote.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: What are the most important issues to you heading into the midterm elections?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Syed Fahim (31, Pakistani American, Pennsylvania, Republican): The No. 1 issue for me is the economy. I’ve seen the prices of everything around me go up — whether it’s gas, food or groceries. Although I am what many would consider upper middle-class, I’ve still had to budget and cut back on some quality of life expenditures, like vacations or the purchasing of other leisure goods and services.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tiansang Sylverne (38, Asian American, Illinois, Democrat): I generally care about social issues more than fiscal issues. So after the Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade, abortion access is now very important to me. Gun control is, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Luke Bay (43, Korean American, California, independent): Gun control and health care. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rohan Vaidya (24, Indian American, Texas, independent): Health care, the economy and preserving the health of our democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kylin Beeson (31, Chinese American, Washington, Democrat): Abortion access is very important. Even though abortion is legal where I live, I still think this is a relevant issue and that it should be legal for women everywhere. Addressing climate change is also top of mind for me. I’d really like to see more politicians who promote policies and actions toward that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: </strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/22/999345393/the-growing-power-of-the-aapi-vote-by-the-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Polling suggests</strong></a><strong> that Asian American voter turnout spiked in 2020. Were you especially motivated to vote that year? And are you planning to vote in the 2022 midterm elections?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sylverne: I was very motivated to vote in 2020. I think a lot of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters like myself were tired after enduring four years under Donald Trump and were ready to vote him out of office. I personally had many issues with him, including the fact that I think he’s not ethical and lacks morals. I’m also planning on voting in this year’s midterm elections, but I wouldn’t say I’m more motivated than I was in prior years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: As I’ve gotten older, I’ve learned that voting is a privilege, so voting in 2020 was very important to me — as is voting this year. While voting <em>is</em> a constitutional right, there are so many ways in which people’s right to vote is being restricted or is made more difficult. As a result, I don’t take voting for granted. I take voting seriously and want to make sure that my voice is heard.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Do you see Asian Americans more as one distinct group or as a set of different ethnic and racial groups?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I think we’re very diverse, with very diverse viewpoints. As a Pakistani American and practicing Muslim, my concerns are probably very different from those of, say, people of Eastern Asian descent — whether they be Chinese, Vietnamese or Korean American. So I view us not as a monolith, but as a range of many different ethnicities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: Asia is such a huge continent with many different cultures. As a Korean American, I know that I have completely different experiences from other Asian Americans. My family came here — through a green card program for nurses that my mom qualified for — seeking new opportunities. And the struggles they faced in life are different from the ones that other Asian Americans suffered. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I definitely see us as a mix of different ethnic and racial groups and not as a homogeneous voting bloc. We come from so many different counties and all have different experiences. For example, I’m an Asian American adopted from China, and I currently live in a very rural, predominantly white neighborhood. So the things that affect me are different from the things that affect Asian Americans who live in urban areas or someone who has just come into the United States. I think everyone’s experience is unique and different, so you can’t make broad generalizations about Asian Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: </strong><strong>Do you identify more as an Asian American or as a member of a specific Asian American ethnic or racial group?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I identify more with a specific subset of the Asian American community, which is Pakistani or South Asian American.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sylverne: I identify more with Asian Americans in general. I’m Chinese, but I don’t know if there’s a huge difference between Chinese Americans and Korean Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: If people ask, I’m Korean American first. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: I personally identify more with being Indian American than I do with being Asian American.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I would normally say Asian American, but if someone asks me my specific ethnic or racial background, I’d say Chinese American. I don’t know if I feel strongly toward either, though.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Do your values align more with the Republican Party or Democratic Party? Does your racial and ethnic identity affect your political views? If so, how?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: Socially, I’m more inclined to support the Republican Party. My wife and I are both practicing Muslims, so our religious and social values tend to skew more toward the right. When it comes to things like health care, however, we tend to skew more to the left. But I don’t think my racial and ethnic identity affects my politics, per se. I don’t think that being of a certain race or religion predisposes me to one political party over the other. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: I used to be a super hardcore right-winger. But during the Obama presidency, the hypocrisy of the right started popping up and showing its ugly face. I started to realize, “Hey, these people don’t even like me as a person.” Plus, later on in life I did a lot of traveling and that opened my eyes up to things touted by Democrats — like universal health care and universal access to education. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But I think what really made me turn away from Republicans is what happened when my dad was diagnosed with cancer. At this point, his business had already failed and he was scraping by making a living as a roofer. When he needed help with his health care, the U.S. wouldn’t do anything. He got lucky enough to go back to Korea and get health care there as an American citizen, but Missouri, where we were living at the time, didn’t approve him for treatment until after he passed away. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I do think that my racial and ethnic identity affects my politics now. It seems like the Republican Party doesn’t want immigrants here and that they don’t even see us as real people. Democrats have their own issues with how they treat Asians, but at least they’ll say that I’m welcome to be here. I just see more racist crap from Republicans than I do [from] Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: I’d say that my values have become more aligned with the Democratic Party over time. My racial and ethnic identity plays a role in the sense that I don’t feel as though the Republican Party adequately represents the interests of the Indian American community or the Asian American community at large.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Americans are very concerned about the economy and inflation. Have these issues personally affected you, and will they affect who you vote for this fall? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I work in a community health setting where I serve people who either have no insurance or are on Medicaid, so I interact with the most vulnerable in our society in terms of having access to health care. I know that they’re affected way more than I am by inflation and price increases, but I’ve felt the effects of inflation, too, even at my income level. Like I said, we did have to cut back a bit on some leisure spending. That said, I already intended to vote [for Republicans] this November, and I don’t see that changing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sylverne: Everyone can see the gas prices rising and prices in grocery stores increasing, but this is a global issue. It’s not just happening in America. But, in general, fiscal issues are just not as important to me when it comes to who I vote for.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: The economy and inflation are definitely top issues for me headed into the midterms. Inflation has affected me because buying things like food or consumer goods has become more expensive, which puts a strain on my finances. Still, as far as voting goes, the economy and inflation don’t impact my vote this fall insofar as they’re not the main bases on which I’m voting. So, while the economy is important, it doesn’t necessarily override other policy concerns that I have.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I definitely feel the impact of inflation, especially when I’m grocery shopping or going to the gas station. I’ve felt like I should cut back on my spending and be more conservative about not buying things that I don’t really need. But I wouldn’t say inflation is going to affect my vote. I still think I’m going to vote for Democrats this fall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are there certain policy issues on which you trust one party more than the other? If so, what are they? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: When it comes to gun rights and tax policy, I think the Republican Party reflects my values more closely. But in terms of things like foreign policy, health care and abortion access (but only for the life or health of the mother or in cases of rape or incest), I tend to agree more with the Democratic Party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sylverne: On abortion access, gun control, environmental issues and preserving our democracy, I trust Democrats more. But with fiscal issues, it’s hard to tell. I don’t agree with the trickle-down economics approach that Republicans have adopted, but I don’t agree with all of Democrats’ economic policies, either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: In regards to women’s health, the economy, climate change, marijuana legalization at the national level and criminal justice issues, I trust Democrats more. But that’s probably all just bias. Lately, I feel such disgust for most Republicans because of their policies and attitudes these days, so I can’t say that there are policy issues where I trust their judgment more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Have you noticed a lurch either to the left or right among Asian American voters within your community? Has your political ideology changed over the last few years? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I’ve noticed that people in my community tend to skew left. And with the election of Trump in 2016, I’ve seen that accelerate more and more — even among my friends and people in my age range. In regards to myself, however, I would say that, in the last few years, I’ve moved more to the right. When someone goes out of their way to oppose you and your views, it makes you more defensive and dig in a little bit more to the positions that perhaps weren’t so hard and fast before. At least, that’s how I am personally.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: People here have moved a little toward the right, particularly on guns and law and order issues, because of the attacks that happened to Asian people as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. My sisters live in New York, and they even tell me they’re afraid to go outside sometimes. And I know in Southern California, where I live, that a lot of Asians have bought guns for protection. So in that sense, they’re more on Republicans’ side when it comes to guns, but it’s mainly so they can protect themselves. My political ideology hasn’t changed in the last few years, though.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: In my estimation, younger Indian Americans and younger Asian American voters still seem very tied to the Democratic Party. But I have seen older Asian American voters, particularly middle-aged men in my community, move toward the Republican Party in recent years. But that’s just my anecdotal experience. As for myself, I’d say that my political ideology has definitely changed. A few years ago, I might have described myself as a Republican-leaning independent, and now I would say I’m a Democratic-leaning independent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Were you affected by discrimination as a result of COVID-19 pandemic? And if so, has that affected your vote previously — and will it affect your vote this year? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: No, I wasn’t personally affected by any discrimination related to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this point in time, COVID-19 and its after-effects have almost no effect at all on determining who I would vote for in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: Fortunately, I wasn’t the target of any discrimination, but I know people of Asian descent who were either the targets of racist comments or were actively threatened in public places. Personally, discrimination as a result of the pandemic won’t affect <em>my</em> vote this November, but I know many people who say they’ll be voting differently this year as a result of the discrimination they suffered throughout the pandemic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I experienced some microaggressions early on. For example, I would go to the grocery store and people would not want to stand near me. But I haven’t experienced anything overt or aggressive, thankfully. I don’t think the discrimination I experienced, however, will affect my vote this fall.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: A </strong><a href="https://aapidata.com/blog/2022-aavs-motivated-electorate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>recent report</strong></a><strong> claimed that only about half of Asian Americans said they have been contacted by either major political party. Have you been contacted by either Democrats or Republicans this year? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: The Republican Party has reached out repeatedly in order to solicit donations, if that counts. But in terms of just contacting me to connect or get involved, I haven’t had either major political party reach out to me this cycle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: I have been contacted only by Democrats and only by one campaign, which would be the Beto O’Rourke campaign [for governor] in Texas. They’ve primarily reached out through mass texts soliciting donations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I have not been contacted ever in my life as far as I can recall, but I also don’t put myself out there very often. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What is a common stereotype or misconception about Asian American voters that you wish both parties would stop falling for?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I think a common misconception is that Asian Americans are a monolith. ... I wish there was a little bit more recognition of our differences versus just lumping us all under one ‘Asian American’ category. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: On the Republican side, it’d be the ‘model minority’ myth. Meanwhile, Democrats seem to take us for granted because they assume all people of color will vote left. Steven Yeun from The Walking Dead summed up my feeling perfectly when he said, “Sometimes I wonder if the Asian American experience is what it’s like when you’re thinking about everyone else, but no one is thinking about you.” That’s how I feel treated by both parties.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a time-honored tradition of election season: the debate. But for many midterm contests this year, it’s missing. Take the Senate race in Nevada. As of Tuesday, Oct. 18, three weeks before Election Day, Democratic incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and her Republican challenger, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/nevada-stands-alone-only-battleground-senate-debate-midterms-rcna52028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had not agreed to a debate before the Nov. 8 election</a>. It’s a closely watched, tight race — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast considers it a toss-up</a> — so the likelihood the candidates won’t meet on a debate stage seems a bit unusual. But it is not so unusual for this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Digging into a thorough (but not comprehensive) <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPyE8jDqKXVMnKjLQOYfJsQ7LPzu4lKu6ZsZeD2MK0A/edit#gid=1150776969" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database of debate schedules maintained</a> by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AP-aeseNIOU/gregory-giroux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregory Giroux of Bloomberg</a>, and supplementing it with our own research, we found that the 2022 cycle has seen fewer debates between candidates for Senate and governors than previous cycles.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did not count debates in House races because of the sheer number of them and our concerns about being comprehensive enough to include their data in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> There are a number of possible reasons for this, but a big one might be that earlier this year the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/rnc-votes-withdrawal-commission-presidential-debates-84091035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican National Committee left the Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, claiming bias and ending a partnership with the Democratic Party that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/14/1092916451/republicans-say-theyre-quitting-the-biased-commission-on-presidential-debates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began in 1987</a>. While that doesn’t directly affect down-ticket races, it helped set a tone.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="This year has seen fewer debates between Senate candidates" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Nh3cd/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s look closely at the Senate. Out of 36 contests this year,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including special elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> we counted only 19 debates in 15 contests held as of Oct. 18.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debates counted include at least two major candidates meeting to answer questions from an independent moderator. A &amp;#8220;major candidate&amp;#8221; is considered to be either a candidate from a major party, or a viable third-party or unaffiliated candidate, such as independent Evan McMullin in Utah in 2022. McMullin is being &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/16/utah-independent-senate-candidate-evan-mcmullin-00062004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;backed by state Democrats&lt;/a&gt; as that party decided not to nominate a candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> Candidates in at least four states have had two debates: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, which are both competitive races; <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska</a>, in which Republican Kelly Tshibaka is slightly favored to beat incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, according to our Deluxe forecast; and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont</a>, which is considered safe for Democrat Peter Welch, currently the state’s at-large representative to the U.S. House. But in the other 11 states where the two major candidates have already debated — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Utah — the candidates have only met once. This means 58 percent of Senate races this year have not had any debates so far. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of this cycle’s debates looked like they wouldn’t happen at all until recently. That was the case for the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-tim-ryan-meet-ohio-senate-debate/story?id=91254198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oct. 10</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/wireStory/ryan-vance-odds-abortion-jan-ohio-senate-debate-91655554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oct. 17</a> debates in Ohio between Senate candidates Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat, and venture capitalist  J.D. Vance, a Republican. The candidates <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/09/tim-ryan-jd-vance-agree-to-two-october-debates-for-ohios-us-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negotiated the terms of the debates</a> through August and September, and one debate was canceled <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-ohio-campaigns-mike-dewine-political-debates-be1b69abcd9ad518744ba667bd145332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after Vance did not respond to an invitation</a> by the Ohio Debate Commission. In the end, Vance and Ryan’s latest debates may have <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/tim-ryan-and-jd-vance-trade-insults-in-bitter-ohio-senate-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted the differences</a> between the two candidates but don’t seem to have upended the race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To compare those numbers to previous election cycles, we set a cutoff date of three weeks before Election Day. In 2020, a year marked by special protocols because of the COVID-19 pandemic, candidates in 20 Senate races had held debates by this point in the election cycle, 57 percent of the total. (That year in the Senate, there were 33 regularly scheduled elections and two special elections.) Candidates in nine of those races had held more than one debate. In Maine, where Democrat Sara Gideon hoped to unseat longtime Republican incumbent Sen. Susan Collins, the candidates had debated twice by this point in the cycle, and would go on to meet <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/29/final-debate-susan-collins-and-sara-gideon-spar-over-senate-seat/6067727002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three more times</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Previous recent election cycles were more similar to 2020 than to this year, and my colleague Nathaniel Rakich kept track of the numbers of debates — again, supplemented by additional research — in 2016 and 2018. In 2016, 65 percent of that cycle’s 34 Senate races had featured at least one debate by this point in the cycle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">2016 and 2020 are presidential election years, though, when more people are tuned into politics and there’s a top-of-the-ticket election to raise the stakes. Yet even when compared with the previous midterm cycle, this year’s debate numbers are lagging. In 2018, 49 percent of Senate races had at least one debate by now. That year, there were also six races in which candidates had already met for two or more debates, leading to a higher overall total of debates held by this point: 24 in 2018 compared with 19 this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, there were more Senate debates in the final three weeks before the 2018 election than there are currently scheduled for this year.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 2 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> In 2018, there were at least 27 gubernatorial and 17 Senate debates across the country in the final three weeks until Election Day, including multiple debates in some races. This year, at least 13 gubernatorial and eight Senate debates are scheduled for these final three weeks. Time is running out for this year’s candidates to catch up.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Candidate debates are now less common in statewide races" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nSykQ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">For governor’s races, there is a similar but slightly less dramatic decline. In 2018, the same number of seats up for grabs as this year — 36 — and there had been debates in 72 percent of the races as of three weeks before the election. In 13 states, candidates had already met more than once. This year, candidates in only 58 percent of gubernatorial elections have debated in the same timeframe, and only eight states have held multiple debates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year also saw an acceleration of a similar trend that dates <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2018/09/three_of_alabamas_last_four_go.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back to at least 2016</a>: high-profile, major-party frontrunners, usually Republicans, skipping debates altogether. In some cases, this has left <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9okuNawcpOs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XEtmSvz3Aw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate</a> to answer questions alone, or led to a <a href="https://mydakotan.com/2022/09/hoeven-declines-nd-senate-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debate between</a> <a href="https://710keel.com/louisiana-senate-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a major-party challenger</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhQIyg7UPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-party or unaffiliated candidate</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few caveats here: We tried to be thorough, but we could have missed some debates. And there are still three weeks for candidates to add debates to this year’s schedule. Of course, there is also time for currently scheduled debates to be canceled. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite that, it does seem that debates got off to a slower start this year, and there are comparatively fewer contests in which candidates will debate at all, and fewer races where candidates will meet more than once. What’s going on? Most of the COVID-19 restrictions, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/us/politics/trump-debate-coronavirus-safety.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate testing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8DHcnwAvKw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social distancing</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/politics/dnc-coronavirus-primary-debate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debates without live audiences</a>, have been lifted, but it’s possible that’s had a lasting effect on some debate traditions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also valid reasons candidates might decline to debate. There’s <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/presidential-debates-have-shockingly-little-effect-on-election-outcomes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ample evidence</a> that general-election presidential debates, for example, don’t make much of a difference. By the time debates are held, many voters have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/28/5-facts-about-presidential-and-vice-presidential-debates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made up their minds</a> about who to vote for, and most of those who haven’t aren’t very swayed by the debates. The events <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/08/senate-debate-season-2022-00055352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can hurt candidates</a>, though, making them high risk and low reward. It would be hard to argue that any one debate misstep cost a candidate an election, but these moments can live on in viral social media and cause a blow to a campaign. That was the case when, in a Republican presidential primary debate, then-Gov. Rick Perry of Texas <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/21/1124218284/this-midterm-season-the-role-of-the-debate-has-changed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forgot the name of one of the three cabinet departments</a> he said he’d eliminate. They can also feed into overall perceptions of candidates, as when former President George H.W. Bush <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBrW2Pz9Iiw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checked his watch during a town hall debate</a> in 1992 and then flubbed answering a voter’s question about the economy, making him seem aloof and disconnected.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the same forces apply in Senate, House and gubernatorial contests, and there are additional factors this cycle too. Nationally, the Democratic Party <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/10/democrats-midterms-spending-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is spending less on candidates across the country</a> than they did in recent cycles, when they spent millions even on longshot races, which may mean fewer well-funded campaigns with the resources to push for debates. In some states, Democrats running for statewide office <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/leading-democrats-debate-election-denying-opponents/story?id=90660587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are refusing to debate their election-denying opponents</a>. But the <a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/mastriano-and-shapiro-cant-agree-to-terms-for-gubernatorial-debate/41465165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bigger trend seems to be that Republican candidates</a> around the country are declining debate opportunities, driven by <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/09/01/candidates-mostly-republican-skip-debates-bar-press-during-midterm-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skepticism of and hostility toward the media outlets</a> that often host, moderate and air the debates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But voters do tend to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/28/5-facts-about-presidential-and-vice-presidential-debates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch <em>presidential</em> debates when they happen</a>, and say they find them useful, according to the Pew Research Center. In midterm years like this one, when people are less tuned into politics than during presidential election years, the debates themselves <a href="https://www.wrdw.com/2022/10/07/political-science-expert-weighs-importance-debates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might remind voters</a> there’s an election in their state at all and inspire them to make it to the polls. And there are arguments that regular debates in which candidates spontaneously answer questions on important issues in front of voters are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/10/10/the-worrying-decline-of-the-senate-candidate-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good for democracy as a whole</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the trendline is clear. The number of debates have declined so far this year. The question is whether one day they disappear for good.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“We’ve had the death threats,” Stacie Wilke-McCulloch said. “We’ve had the, ‘We know where you live,’ and all that.” As a trustee on the school board for Carson City, Nevada, for the past 14 years, Wilke-McCulloch is no stranger to harassment, particularly as <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2021/12/16/are-fiery-school-board-meetings-representative-of-all-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school boards bore the brunt of criticism</a> over <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-education-threats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial curricula and school closures related to COVID-19</a>. As a result, she’s gained a thick skin that may serve her well in what she hopes will be her next job: Carson City County Clerk-Recorder. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Once occupying a low-profile, largely bureaucratic position, county clerks are increasingly the target of intense public vitriol. Typically the chief election official for their communities, county clerks and other local election workers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/campaign-of-fear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have faced harassment from voters</a> convinced the 2020 election was fraudulent, thanks to former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of a stolen election. As a result, some election officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/us/politics/2020-election-voting-officials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are leaving their posts</a> — and in some places, election deniers are <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/behind-the-campaign-to-put-election-deniers-in-charge-of-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing up to replace them</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s only one part of the story. Across the country, many local election officials are staying put with the support of their communities. And in Nevada, where county clerks are up for election this fall, the full spectrum of local election administration is on display: the good, the bad and the conspiracy-riddled. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Carson City, Clerk-Recorder Aubrey Rowlatt is not running for reelection after serving just one term, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family. But <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/election-official-departures-rising-amid-burnout-angry-voters-new-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she also told the Nevada Independent</a> that she was burned out and wasn’t looking forward to administering this year’s election after how “emotionally charged” the 2020 election was. That said, Rowlatt won’t be replaced by an election denier. In interviews with FiveThirtyEight, both Wilke-McCulloch and opponent Scott Hoen said they believed the 2020 election was legitimate. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/win-house-watch-districts-fivethirtyeight-91751494</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Out of Nevada’s 17 counties and county equivalents, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 have elected county clerks</a> who serve as the chief election official (two counties, Clark and Washoe, have an appointed registrar of voters who oversees elections). Of those 15, 12 have an incumbent clerk who is running unopposed in the general election next month, many of whom have been in the job for years. While some had to fend off challengers in the primary, others, like White Pine Clerk Nichole Baldwin, ran unopposed there, too. Baldwin — who was first elected in 2014 — said that although the 2020 election led to an unprecedented level of public response and distrust, she hasn’t experienced harassment or threats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every time the public has approached us with questions or assertions of failed election integrity, I’ve been able to effectively respond to them directly, and whether or not they accept my answer, they walk away,” Baldwin said. “There are a lot of us [clerks] who are sticking it out.”</p>

Trump’s claims of a stolen 2020 election sowed distrust in Nye County, where the voting machines used to not only cast but also count ballots came under intense scrutiny. In March, the county commissioners <a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2022/10/11/nye-county-nevada-ballots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to recommend the county switch to hand-counting paper ballots</a>, despite County Clerk Sandra Merlino’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-las-vegas-nevada-race-and-ethnicity-elections-81814d555debbe44c3be812b43742abd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defense of the system’s security</a>. As a result, Merlino threw in the towel after more than 20 years in the job, <a href="https://pvtimes.com/news/nye-county-bids-farewell-to-longtime-clerk-merlino-111902/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retiring this summer</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/us/politics/nye-county-nevada-hand-count-mail-ballots.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACLU is suing</a> the county, and an election denier was appointed to replace Merlino. Mark Kampf, who won the Republican nomination for county clerk in June, was appointed to fill Merlino’s post through the election, in which he is running against one other candidate. <a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/2020-election-denier-tapped-to-oversee-voting-in-nye-county-mark-kampf-clerk-pahrump-tonopah-secretary-of-state-barbara-cegavske-hand-count-donald-trump-gop-republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kampf has repeated election fraud conspiracy theories</a> and said he believes Trump won in 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And he’s not alone. The Storey County Clerk-Treasurer was, until February of this year, Vanessa Stephens, who resigned; it’s currently Jim Hindle, <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/politics/nevada-republican-who-signed-fake-certificate-for-trump-wins-race-for-top-elections-official/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who signed on to serve as one</a> of the illegitimate “alternate electors” for Trump in an attempt to overturn the state’s presidential election results. Hindle <a href="https://silverstateelection.nv.gov/county-results/storey.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a closely contested GOP primary</a> in the summer, and is also running unopposed in November. And Jim Marchant, the Republican nominee to be the top election official in the state, said not only that the 2020 election was fraudulent, but also <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-debates-secretary-of-state-candidates-cast-wildly-different-visions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that the vote of Nevadans</a> “hasn’t counted for decades,” falsely claiming election winners had been “selected” rather than elected. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even in counties where the incumbent clerk has remained in place, election conspiracy theories are fueling changes. County commissioners floated the <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/esmeralda-is-latest-rural-county-to-try-ditching-electronic-voting-machines-move-to-hand-counting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">idea of abandoning voting machines</a> in Elko and Lincoln counties, and in Esmeralda County — as in Nye County — it was adopted. Though voting using hand-marked paper ballots is <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/08/14/why-paper-is-considered-state-of-the-art-voting-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered the gold standard</a> for election security, hand-counting those ballots — as opposed to using vote-tabulation machines — is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/07/1126796538/voting-explainer-hand-counting-ballots-accuracy-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time-intensive, costly and prone to error</a>. As long as there are paper records and precautions taken to limit risk, vote-tabulation machines are considered both secure and efficient. Meanwhile, Lander County <a href="https://elkodaily.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/lander-county-to-replace-dominion-voting-machines/article_7f11691f-8857-56d7-a3be-baffb0c9fb46.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commissioners voted to spend nearly a quarter of a million dollars</a> to replace the Dominion voting machines used with ones made by another company, ES&amp;S, due to false conspiracy theories around Dominion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So while the threat of election deniers taking over election administration hasn’t infiltrated every corner of Nevada, a meaningful shift is happening, according to <a href="https://dfdamore.faculty.unlv.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Damore</a>, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Election administration is now a partisan issue whereas in the past it was just government doing government business,” Damore said. In this way, Nevada is a microcosm of what we’re seeing in elections across the U.S. It’s not as though veteran, trusted election administrators are being replaced wholesale with election-denying conspiracy theorists, but that threat is real. We’re now in an era where political parties are not only concerned with who wins elections, but also who runs them. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>Back by popular demand (a phrase which here means “Alex peer-pressured me into it”), it’s the FiveThirtyEight politics chat! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are somehow only three weeks left until Election Day, and the FiveThirtyEight forecast is furiously updating several times a day now. As of Tuesday, Oct. 18, at 1 p.m. Eastern, Democrats had a 63-in-100 chance of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holding onto the Senate</a> in the Deluxe version of our forecast, and Republicans had a 73-in-100 chance of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipping the House</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we know better than some <em>computer</em>, right?! (<em>Editor’s note: No, the whole point of the forecast is to eliminate the biases that inevitably arise when humans make predictions.</em>) OK, fine, good point, editor. But there <em>are</em> things that the model doesn’t know that we do — like which races the national parties have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/22/house-gop-cuts-loose-candidate-who-misled-about-military-service-00058406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given up on</a> and which candidates are <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/09/doug-mastriano-doesnt-call-himself-a-christian-nationalist-but-hes-certainly-given-the-doctrine-a-platform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too extreme</a> or otherwise <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embroiled in controversy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So today, we’re going to play a game of “Are You Smarter Than The FiveThirtyEight Forecast?” I’m going to name a few important races and cite the FiveThirtyEight forecast’s odds in them. Then you guys tell me whether you think the forecast is too good for Democrats or too good for Republicans. (If you want to be a coward, you can also say you think the forecast is about right.) Everyone ready?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/win-house-watch-districts-fivethirtyeight-91751494</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>I am ready to outthink you, IBM Blue/Watson/whatever your name is. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/santul-nerkar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santul Nerkar</a>, editor):<strong> </strong>I am ready to lose!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): This chat will prove why I’m not an election forecaster. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, let’s start with the <strong>Arizona governor’s race</strong>. According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Deluxe forecast</a>, Republican former newscaster Kari Lake has a 55-in-100 chance of winning and Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs has a 45-in-100 chance. What say you?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>This might be an unpopular opinion, but I’m honestly surprised this race isn’t more squarely in Lake’s column. Our forecast and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> have Lake and Hobbs essentially tied, but it just seems like Lake is the more visible candidate — especially lately. There are <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/15/kari-lake-arizona-trump-midterm-elections-maga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so many</a> stories <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/politics/kari-lake-arizona-governor-swing-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out there</a> now about how she’s a rising star in the GOP and could even be a Republican presidential candidate in the future. I’m not sure if “charisma” is the right term to use here, but her <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/arizona-kari-lake-false-fraud-claims-2020-election-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience as a TV personality</a>, plus the fact that she’s been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/16/kari-lake-arizona-election-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the news a lot</a> recently (kinda like former President Donald Trump!), could make her a tough candidate to beat. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>At the risk of sounding like a coward right off the bat, I think the forecast here sounds about right! As our colleague Kaleigh Rogers <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/arizona-election-update-blake-masters-kari-lake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last month</a>, Lake has much better odds in the governor’s race than Republican venture capitalist Blake Masters does in the Senate race. Part of that comes down to the opponents each candidate is facing, but it may also suggest that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openly denying the legitimacy of the 2020 election</a> might not be a death knell for one’s candidacy. (Lake has been one of the leading proponents of the baseless idea that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, while Masters has been more circumspect.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plus, there are other reasons to be more bullish on Lake than on Masters. She enjoys high name recognition due to two decades as a local TV newscaster, as Alex mentioned, while Hobbs has <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/21/democratic-candidate-katie-hobbs-criticizes-2020-election-fraud-claims/10118553002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced widespread scrutiny</a> on the right, thanks to her up-close-and-personal role administering the 2020 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>To be clear, I don’t think the forecast is wildly underestimating Lake’s odds in this race, because it’ll probably be a close one. At least <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-2022-elections-in-arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one recent poll</a> has Hobbs’s and Lake’s favorability numbers tied at 39 percent (Lake’s favorability was net -3 points, while Hobbs’s was net +3 points), and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-kelly-opinion-poll-arizona-senate-economy-abortion-immigration-2022-10-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another poll</a> showed that just over half the state’s registered voters (51 percent) classified Lake’s views as “extreme.” I think what differentiates Lake is her visibility/personality — and that could resonate with voters! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I also tend to view our forecast as about right on this one. The polls have been close, and <a href="https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/katie-hobbs-has-fundraising-edge-in-race-for-arizona-governor/article_322f1026-4e4e-11ed-9ec7-539915fed12e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hobbs has outraised Lake</a>, but Lake has had more outside financial help (mostly from the Republican Governors Association). Lake is a combative, controversial candidate, but Hobbs isn’t a force in the same way Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is in the Senate contest. For one thing, she’s had to answer for a scandal regarding the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/12/08/katie-hobbs-apologizes-recognizes-discrimination-talonya-adams-firing/6426337001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firing of a Black staff member</a> who served under her when she was in the state Legislature.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Hmmmm. You guys have all made compelling points! I’m going to say the forecast is too good for Republicans, though. I don’t think we need to overthink this one: Lake is a far-right candidate without prior political experience, and Hobbs is a statewide elected official. Plus, Kelly is a pretty good bet to win the Senate race, and as Geoffrey <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fewer-americans-are-likely-to-vote-for-a-republican-governor-and-a-democratic-senator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last week</a>, Senate and governor’s races just don’t go in opposite directions very often anymore. But I agree that the race is close — I think I would just personally switch the odds (so Hobbs at 55-in-100, Lake at 45-in-100).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, let’s move on to the <strong>Pennsylvania governor’s race</strong>. This one is pretty different: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Deluxe forecast</a> gives Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro a 96-in-100 chance of winning. Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano has just a 4-in-100 chance. Thoughts?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>In a state that has a <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/partisan-lean/fivethirtyeight_partisan_lean_STATES.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan lean</a> just slightly to the right of the country, I have a hard time viewing a Democratic candidate as a safe bet — which is what being clear of 95 percent suggests. So I would say this feels too confident in Democrats’ chances. Shapiro is clearly a strong favorite, but nearly a sure thing in a midterm year with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Democrat in the White House</a> in a purple state? No. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Pennsylvania is an interesting state because, yes, I think it’s possible that the polling here might overestimate Democrats in both the Senate and governor’s races. But I agree with our forecast — and the takeaways of other prognosticators — that Shapiro has a clear edge here. It’s pretty telling that national Republicans have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/11/republicans-governor-elections-2022-tv-ads-00061005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">practically abandoned</a> Mastriano.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, but to play devil’s advocate: Shapiro leads in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> by 11 percentage points. That’s a <em>huge</em> lead, and it would require an historic polling error to overcome. Maybe the race will tighten, but you guys don’t think this is safely Democratic?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>To be clear, I’m inclined to agree with our forecast because the GOP kind of, uh, fumbled in Pennsylvania. Neither Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz nor Mastriano are particularly well-liked, and that could dampen turnout among the GOP base. According to a <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/PA-topline_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-September-22-26_released-Sep-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September Fox News/Beacon Research/Shaw &amp;</a> <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/PA-topline_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-September-22-26_released-Sep-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Company Research poll</a>, 34 percent of Oz supporters and 27 percent of Mastriano supporters said they had “some reservations” about their candidate. (Twenty percent of Democratic Lt. Gov John Fetterman’s supporters and 19 percent of Shapiro supporters said the same.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Nathaniel, I guess I’m just focused on the “fundamentals” — the non-polling factors that affect an election, like partisanship and candidate quality. When the fundamentals and polls are this far apart, I get a little uneasy (more on this later). Now, it is true that they can diverge more in governors’ races than in races for federal office, as voters are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as reflexively partisan</a> about gubernatorial races. That certainly is part of why the Pennsylvania gubernatorial contest is where it is. But the forecast still appears too strong for Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Yeah, I’m still going to have to say our forecast is too confident in Democrats’ chances. Along with what Geoffrey said about Pennsylvania’s rightward tilt relative to the country, I refer back to Inside Elections’s rating of the race as “<a href="http://www.insideelections.com/ratings/governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lean Democratic</a>” — which is closer to what our forecast says about the Senate race in the state. And if you view 96 percent as translating to “safe” for Democrats, I find it hard to believe there would be such a large divergence between what the experts and fundamentals are saying and what the polling is saying. I’ll take the side of the former.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah. And actually, I secretly agree with you guys: I think our forecast is too good for Democrats here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, let’s stay in the Keystone State but switch campaigns. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Deluxe forecast</a> for the <strong>Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race</strong> gives Fetterman a 70-in-100 chance, while Oz has a 30-in-100 chance. What do you guys think?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>It’s interesting that the race here <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fetterman-oz-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is tightening</a>. I think that’s a sign that we may be overstating Fetterman’s strength here, too. If I were to bet today, I’d say that Fetterman still has a nice edge since he’s never trailed Oz in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public polling</a>. But the GOP’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-health-new-york-stroke-pennsylvania-1ac53728bd7de09c86ab2da88b94b3be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacks on Fetterman and his health</a> may have weakened him as a candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I think the forecast is about right here. As Alex said earlier, Pennsylvania Republicans just nominated an especially weak slate of statewide candidates this year. Mastriano is a far-right election denier, and Oz is super unpopular thanks to his reputation for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/magazine/dr-oz-pennsylvania-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carpetbagging from New Jersey</a> and a nasty Republican primary that <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-polling-favorability-fetterman-pa-2022-20220630.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dragged down his unfavorable ratings</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>We have almost no fresh polling in this race. There have been <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TRF-PA-General-1013-Full-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just two polls</a> conducted entirely in October, and while both showed Fetterman just barely ahead of Oz, the lack of data here makes me nervous, especially because we saw things tightening based on polls in late September. So I’m inclined to say our forecast is overstating the Democrats’ edge here too. Still, Oz’s favorability numbers are strikingly bad: In late September, <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/10_4_2022_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=4BD88F8A9A453DD5901885959737AFB0274433BF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University/USA Today</a> found that just 34 percent of likely voters had a favorable view of Oz, versus 51 percent who said they had an unfavorable view. By comparison, Fetterman was in the mid-40s for both favorability and unfavorability. That may have changed — give us new polls! — but for now I’d still call Fetterman the favorite.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Oh, good catch about the lack of recent polling, Geoffrey.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I think 70-in-100 sounds about right for Fetterman’s odds. Back in September, when our polling average found Fetterman leading by nearly 11 (!) points, Democrats’ overall chances in the Senate had reached a peak of about 70-in-100. But as the national environment has tightened, so has this race. I think the national forces that have slightly tempered Democrats’ chances in the Senate — decreasing enthusiasm around <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issues like abortion</a>, and increasing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/us/politics/republicans-economy-nyt-siena-poll.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus on the economy</a> — have also largely applied to the Pennsylvania Senate race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I love how “our forecast is largely right” has been the takeaway of this chat so far! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>In Math We Trust.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, moving on to … <strong>Nevada</strong>! <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Deluxe forecast</a> says Republican former Attorney General Adam Laxalt has a 51-in-100 chance of winning the U.S. Senate race, while Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto is at 49-in-100. Where would you guys place your bets?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>This race is going to give Democrats heartburn on Election Day, I suspect. A few months ago, I would’ve said that Cortez Masto was in a slightly better position than, say, Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia. But this is why I’m not an election forecaster! Laxalt doesn’t have the same baggage as some of his fellow GOP candidates, like Oz and Herschel Walker of Georgia. So I think this race might come down to whether Democrats are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-driving-bidens-approval-rating-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still on the upswing</a> come Election Day or if a Republican-friendly environment <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bounces back</a>. The fact that Laxalt “leads” Cortez Masto by less than a point in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average</a> means that this race is truly a toss-up, but given the conventional wisdom around midterm elections favoring the party not in the White House, I give Laxalt a slight edge.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I’m inclined to think that our forecast is slightly underrating Republicans’ chances in Nevada. As FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nevada-could-be-senate-republicans-ace-in-the-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently wrote</a>, Nevada isn’t <em>that</em> blue, and midterm elections have often dealt Democrats big losses in the Silver State. Moreover, Nevada doesn’t fit the demographic profile of states in which Democrats have gained in recent years: It has relatively few Black voters, and it’s among the states with the lowest share of college-educated voters — a group with whom Democrats have struggled in recent cycles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>This one feels right to me. Cortez Masto could be the most endangered Democratic incumbent on the ballot: As a former elected official with campaign experience, Laxalt is a better candidate for Republicans than what they have in states like Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. But <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00575548/1642917/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cortez Masto</a> also outraised <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00787135/1642073/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laxalt</a> almost three-to-one in the third quarter of 2022, and while the GOP <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NVS2&amp;spec=N%20https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2010&amp;fips=32&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has more outside spending</a>, candidate committees <a href="https://www.broadcastlawblog.com/2020/10/articles/a-video-summary-of-the-rules-on-lowest-unit-rates-and-other-political-broadcasting-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get much cheaper rates</a> for running ads on TV and radio, so Cortez Masto and Democrats collectively are likely getting more bang for their buck.  Moreover, Nevada midterm polling has a history of underestimating Democrats — former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Cortez Masto’s predecessor, famously <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/senate/nv/nevada_senate_angle_vs_reid-1517.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailed by 2 to 3 points</a> heading into Election Day 2010, only to then win by nearly 6 points. That doesn’t mean it will happen again, but these factors make me inclined to not write off Cortez Masto.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I was intentionally waiting to weigh in on this one…</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I think you’re right, Geoffrey. The vibe ~online~ seems to be that Laxalt is now the favorite, and I’m just not sure that’s true. The race is definitely super close, though, so I’m going to trust the forecast on this one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>This race also might come down to which issues voters prioritize more (surprise, surprise!). Of course, following the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion access should theoretically be a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nevada-senate-race-emerges-as-test-of-abortion-issue-after-roe-v-wade-overturned-11661004000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivating issue for Democrats</a> in the state. But since abortion access is <a href="https://www.kunr.org/politics-and-policy/2022-05-03/nevada-ag-abortions-largely-protected-under-state-constitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enshrined in Nevada’s state constitution</a>, I wonder whether voters will prioritize other issues, such as the economy? In a state like Nevada, that’d certainly make sense — especially considering the impact that the <a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/new-report-reveals-how-hard-pandemic-hit-las-vegas-tourism-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 pandemic had</a> on the state’s tourism industry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>How about another Senate race that’s been in the news a lot lately: <strong>Georgia</strong>? <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Deluxe forecast</a> currently gives Warnock a 59-in-100 chance of winning, while Walker has a 41-in-100 chance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Unlike Pennsylvania, Georgia has been polled a lot recently, and Warnock has consistently led in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every recent poll</a> not sponsored by Walker’s campaign. Warnock’s leads have been slight, though, so the forecast feels about right — generally speaking, a toss-up, but Warnock with the slimmest of edges. In fact, Warnock has made some narrow gains, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you recently wrote</a>, Nathaniel, in the aftermath of allegations that Walker, who opposes abortion rights, paid for a former girlfriend’s abortion in 2009. (Walker denies the claims.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our forecast shows about a 1-in-5 chance of a runoff, too, which also feels right to me. I’m not making any plans for the first week of December. … </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m not convinced! Consider that, a few weeks ago, this was arguably the most contested Senate race in the country, and <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/senate/race/230821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some forecasters</a> predicted that a runoff was possible. I think Walker’s abortion controversy impacted voters’ perception of him (as evidenced by the polls) and that Warnock does have an edge here — but I’m also not yet convinced that he’ll win the race outright in November. Even though Warnock’s polling lead has widened, he still sits at just 48 percent in our average. Now, if he were at 52 or 54 percent, I might feel differently! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, with the 2021 Georgia runoffs a <em>big</em> exception, Georgia runoffs have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically benefited Republican candidates</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Really, Nathaniel? If the race goes to a runoff, I’d think Warnock would be favored because Walker wouldn’t be able to ride Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s coattails to victory. (Kemp is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily favored</a> in his race and has cleared 50 percent in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some recent polls</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I mean, it’s very possible. Especially if control of the Senate is on the line again. I think that motivated Democrats to turn out and buck the trend in 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, if we’re unlucky — election watchers like a break, too — we’ll get to find out whether 2021 is the new normal or an outlier. I can make the case that Warnock will benefit (what Alex said) or that Walker will (the pre-2021 runoff history). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Siding with Alex over this supposed “history” sounds like a safer bet, Geoff! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92a.png" alt="🤪"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I’m all about that history, though, Alex. But I remain open to new trends!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Something I’ve been tracking is whether Walker’s election odds ever dip below his alma mater’s chances of winning the College Football Playoff, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-college-football-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s forecast</a>. (As of now, that seems unlikely — Walker’s Senate chances are 41-in-100, while the Bulldogs have a 23 percent chance of defending their title.)<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, Oct. 18, at 1 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a more serious note, I think our forecast is properly appraising Walker’s chances. Yes, his polling has been shaky, especially after the abortion story. But Georgia still leans to the right of the nation as a whole, and the fundamentals suggest a closer race than the polling — which, again, has been consistently in Warnock’s favor. And to Nathaniel’s point, if this race goes to a runoff, history would seem to be on the side of Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adding all of that together, I think an outlook that gives Warnock decent-but-not-overwhelming odds seems like a fair landing spot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I think you guys are probably making the more sensible calls, but I’m going to be a little <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> spicy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> here and say that the forecast is too good for <em>Republicans</em>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">My hack for this game has been to look at the Classic version of the forecast, instead of the default Deluxe version. The Classic version <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blends the polls and fundamentals</a>, while Deluxe adds in expert ratings like those from Inside Elections and Sabato’s Crystal Ball. And while Warnock is at 59-in-100 in the Deluxe version, he is at 68-in-100 in the Classic version.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means the outside experts are more bullish on Walker than our forecast is by itself. And that … doesn’t really make sense to me. Walker is an incredibly flawed candidate — another political novice like Lake, and someone with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple scandals</a> and controversies surrounding him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given the rate at which bad headlines have <a href="https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/state/georgia/article258250315.html#storylink=cpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drip</a>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-says-hes-a-model-dad-he-has-a-secret-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drip</a>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-critic-of-absentee-dads-admits-to-yet-another-secret-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dripped</a> out about him, I wouldn’t be surprised if even more scandals emerge in these last three weeks of campaigning. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I assume the expert raters are being cautious with Georgia because of its history as a red state, but partisanship is accounted for in the forecast. Walker’s weakness as a candidate, IMO, is not (at least not fully).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Spicy take, Nathaniel! I guess I still feel like it’s entirely possible that Kemp drags Walker across the finish line on Election Day. That’s another reason why it’s hard for me to say with certainty that Walker’s finished here!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, Alex, the gap between the margins in Georgia’s Senate and gubernatorial races <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been pretty small</a> in the past. But it looks like we’re going to get a larger one this time around, with Kemp leading by almost 6 points and Warnock by almost 4 points, per our polling averages. But how large will matter a great deal, because the more split-ticket voters there are, the better it is for Warnock, given Kemp’s stronger position.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I guess my question is how much of a candidate-specific “tax” or penalty Georgia voters will apply to Walker. To Alex’s point, Kemp seems to be on fairly solid footing in his race against former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, while Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger also <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/ajc-poll-raffensperger-leads-ga-elections-race-after-resisting-trump/7YZMC3RNYRCWBKUBK2PZPU3LWY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks safe</a> against his Democratic challenger. In other words, can a GOP Senate candidate run several points behind other statewide candidates and lose in a “red wave” year in Georgia? I’m not sold on that yet.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>If a red wave were developing, Santul, I’d agree with you! But so far, it looks like this will be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closer to a neutral year</a> than a 2010-style red wave.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Anyway, we can save that debate for our last question. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For now, one last Senate race. It’s not one of the top-tier ones, but I think it’s an interesting one for the purposes of this exercise: <strong>Ohio</strong>. The default, Deluxe version of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast</a> gives Republican author J.D. Vance a 73-in-100 chance of winning and Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan a 27-in-100 chance. However, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling is much tighter</a>, and the Lite version of our forecast (which uses only polls) gives Vance only a 56-in-100 chance. Where would you guys peg the race?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Vance seems like a pretty mediocre candidate, as <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/OH/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s been massively outraised</a> and <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/news-features/news/2022/10/18/17/48/poll-shows-ohio-republican-vance-gaining-narrow-edge-over-democrat-ryan-in-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has struggled to consolidate support</a> among the GOP base. However, I’ll be pretty stunned if he doesn’t win on Nov. 8, so count me as one who views our forecast as underselling the GOP’s odds. With an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular Democrat</a> in the White House, I have a hard time seeing a Democrat winning a Senate race in a state that <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=39&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump won</a> by 8 points. If it were 2018 (a good year for Democrats) and we had this matchup, then I’d be singing a different, toss-up tune. But it’s 2022, so I anticipate Vance will be in the Senate come January.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I agree with the sentiment that Vance has an edge here. While I <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/trump-endorses-never-trump-guy-jd-vance-ignoring-many-ohio-republicans-who-wanted-him-to-pick-a-different-candidate-in-a-key-senate-race/articleshow/90869767.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also don’t think</a> that he’s a particularly strong candidate, it’ll be hard for Ryan to cut through in a light-red state. The fact that national Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/10/j-d-vance-tim-ryan-ohio-senate-debate-00061144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have spent a ton of money</a> on Vance’s behalf in the lead-up to Election Day signals to me that this will likely be a close contest, as the Lite version of our forecast suggests. But I think the fact that we’re even talking about a competitive Senate race in such a pro-Trump state speaks volumes about either Ryan’s strength as a candidate and/or Vance’s weakness as one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Yeah, I don’t see a big reason to fault our forecast here, either. To keep things simple, it’s hard to imagine that just two years after Democrats strongly underperformed expectations in the presidential election — and where Biden’s approval is <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/politics/2022/09/27/exclusive-spectrum-news-siena-college-poll-takes-pulse-of-ohio-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep underwater</a> — a Democrat will win a Senate seat. There are reasons to be skeptical of Vance, as he has attracted a lot of scrutiny for his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/06/politics/jd-vance-tweets-trump-apology/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about-face on Trump</a> — going from the “Never Trump” camp of the GOP to a staunchly pro-Trump one. That being said, Vance hasn’t embroiled himself in scandal and controversy quite like, say, Walker, and it’s less clear whether Ohio voters will dock Vance for his transgressions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I’m with Geoffrey here — I think our Ohio forecast, even the Deluxe version, is still too good for Democrats. One tidbit that I think is overlooked: Ryan doesn’t actually have a history of overperforming with white, working-class voters the way his reputation suggests. In 2020, he did just 1.5 points better than Biden in his Youngstown-area congressional district. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, time for our last question! There are too many <strong>House</strong> races to talk about them individually, so we’ll just look at the lower chamber as a whole. As a refresher, our forecast gives Republicans a 73-in-100 chance of flipping the House, while Democrats have just a 27-in-100 chance of keeping control. What are your thoughts?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>If you go district by district, I think it’s hard <em>not</em> to come up with an outcome in which the GOP nets at least five House seats — the mark they need to claim the House, which Democrats currently hold 222 to 213 — so I guess I’m a bit more bullish on their chances than the forecast is. For instance, the GOP <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/gop-house-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should pick up</a> five or six seats based on partisanship alone (with an assist from redistricting, which made several seats notably redder in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>). And history suggests that Republicans <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/historically-toss-races-break-decidedly-toward-one-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will eat into the toss-up seats</a> held by Democrats, too. So I think the narrow margins here make a Republican majority somewhat more likely than roughly 3-in-4.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I mean, I don’t think anyone’s writing off the very real possibility of a red wave. I’m inclined (once again!) to agree with our forecast’s odds of Republicans’ chances here. I know I jokingly bashed “history” before, but I just can’t see Democrats overcoming the conventional wisdom regarding midterm elections. …</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Agreed. The average midterm election since the end of World War II has seen the president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose 26 House seats</a>. And Democrats did a good job bucking that trend for much of the summer (thanks to the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision), but polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> are starting to move back toward Republicans. And while there’s no guarantee that that trend will continue, it does fit with the historical pattern of polls getting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-midterm-chances-dont-hinge-on-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily worse for the president’s party</a> as the midterms approach.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It should be noted that that is already baked into the forecast, which already expects the national environment to improve for Republicans. But the forecast, too, has ticked toward the GOP in the last couple weeks.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="808" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-house-change-711-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-house-change-711-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-house-change-711-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-house-change-711-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, the way I see it, I would give Republicans a better than 3-in-4 chance of getting the minimum they need to control the chamber. But in terms of the magnitude of their gains, I’m far less certain. According to the forecast, 80 percent of outcomes fall between the Republicans winning 210 seats (meaning there’d be a Democratic-controlled House) to 244 seats (a very strong Republican showing). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Yeah, I think the conventional wisdom would suggest that the House is still Republicans’ to lose in November — even with the bounce Democrats enjoyed over the summer after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The last midterm in which a party that had the presidency went on to gain seats in the House was 2002, the first election after the Sept. 11 attacks and amid strong approval ratings for former President George W. Bush. Though there have already been watershed moments for the Biden administration that could serve to boost overall turnout — including the forgiveness of some student loans, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the call to reschedule marijuana — Biden’s approval remains around 10 points underwater. That’s not a recipe for keeping the House, and our model reflects that reality.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Two weeks ago, the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-life-herschel-walker-paid-for-girlfriends-abortion-georgia-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world learned</a> that Herschel Walker, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Georgia who supports a total abortion ban without exceptions, had paid for his pregnant then-girlfriend to get an abortion in 2009. (Walker denies this.) At the time, we cautioned that we would need to wait and see how the controversy might <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affect Walker’s chances of winning the race</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We now have new polling data that suggests that the story may have cost Walker <em>some</em> support.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> Those surveys showed Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock leading, on average, 48 percent to 45 percent among likely voters. Previously, in those same pollsters’ most recent surveys taken before the news broke, the two candidates were essentially tied at 47 percent each.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That’s not a ton of movement; it’s also narrow enough to be within the surveys’ margins of error. But the consistency among pollsters gives us more confidence that it represents a true shift.

And in fact, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/uga-poll-warnock-walker-close-kemp-builds-lead-over-abrams/DAY5A2E4WFCFJJELA3WHAL6ILE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two</a> other <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=e363ce46-6a44-4584-9c5b-3c271473b1ba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> conducted almost entirely <em>before</em> the abortion story broke also showed a shift toward Warnock in recent weeks.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That raises the question: Did anything else happen in September that could have hurt Walker or helped Warnock? Well, Democrats did spend the month hammering Walker in TV ads over <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/democrats-emphasize-herschel-walkers-threats-ex-wife-new-georgia-ad-rcna45544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old allegations of domestic abuse</a>. According to the <a href="https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/releases-100622/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wesleyan Media Project</a>, from Sept. 19 to Oct. 2, there were 7,257 pro-Democrat ads in the race compared to 5,934 pro-Republican ads.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/herschel-walker-goodwill-georgia-win-senate-seat-89425858</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The most likely answer is that movement in the race is due to a combination of the abortion story and other preexisting factors like the Democrats’ TV advantage. Polling from InsiderAdvantage bears this out. The firm has actually surveyed Georgia four times in the last six weeks, giving us a more granular look at how the race has shifted (or hasn’t).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In InsiderAdvantage’s <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/new-insideradvantage-fox-5-poll-kemp-widens-lead-over-abrams-senate-race-remains-tight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept. 6-7 poll</a>, taken before both the abortion revelations and the last several weeks of Democratic advertising, Walker led 47 percent to 44 percent.  Then, the pollster was <a href="https://insideradvantage.com/2022/10/05/insideradvantagefox-5-poll-warnock-walker-still-in-statistical-tie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the field on Oct. 3</a> when the abortion story broke that evening. As a result, it decided to scrub that poll and start over the next day. No details were released about that Oct. 3 poll, which is why it doesn’t show up on our polls page, but the pollster did tease that it showed Warnock leading by 1 point. That suggests that the race moved 4 points toward Warnock between Sept. 6-7 and Oct. 3 (at least according to this one pollster).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">InsiderAdvantage then released the poll it took on Oct. 4, the day after the abortion story broke: It showed Warnock leading by 4 points. That suggests that the race moved an additional 3 points toward Warnock between Oct. 3 and Oct. 4 (i.e., after the abortion story broke). Of course, this is just one poll. But 3 points is still a lot of movement in just one day.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, InsiderAdvantage released a new poll just this week, conducted on Oct. 16. That poll — the one we used in the table above — gave Warnock a 3-point lead. So Walker may have started to recover from the bad headlines … or this may have just been an insignificant shift caused by normal polling error. (Again, all the other shifts are within the margin of error too — we only feel comfortable discussing them because other pollsters have shown similar things.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">There are still three weeks until Election Day, so this isn’t the final word on Walker’s fate. It’s possible that his scandals will become old news and Walker will (continue to?) recover in the polls. According to our forecast, there’s an 18-in-100 chance that this race will go to a runoff on Dec. 6. (If no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the general election, Georgia requires a runoff election to be held between the top two finishers.) That could mean even more time for Walker’s scandals to recede into the rearview mirror — or for another scandal to occur. So basically, don’t take your eyes off this race.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Throughout the primary season, Democrats caused a stir by involving themselves in Republican primary elections — often described as “meddling” — by spending money to boost potentially weaker GOP contenders in the hopes of improving Democrats’ chances in the general election. This brand of opposite-party meddling <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a25090/donald-segretti-ratfking-100413/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a long history</a> in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/18/democrats-primary-mastriano-lake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our politics</a>, but because the Republican candidates who stood to benefit in 2022 often embraced extreme positions such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denying the legitimacy of the 2020 election</a>, many observers — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/27/meijer-dccc-trump-primaries-00048104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including many Democrats</a> — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/01/democrats-risky-meddling-gop-primaries-00048962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were critical</a> of this interference.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic-aligned groups spent money in more than a dozen Republican primaries, and six of their preferred candidates won congressional or gubernatorial primaries, according to data compiled by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/12/democrats-interfere-republican-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>.

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s unclear to what extent Democratic interference actually altered the outcomes in these Republican primaries — and, in some cases, how much the primary’s outcome significantly altered the general election outlook. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, four of these six candidates had former President Donald Trump’s endorsement, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-endorsees-have-started-losing-more-but-dont-read-into-that-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted many Republican candidates</a> in primaries this cycle. Additionally, Democratic incumbents are defending three of these seats, potentially providing a small lift to Democratic chances in both New Hampshire races and Illinois’s gubernatorial election. And a couple of these contests are taking place on fairly blue turf, so they would have been more likely than not to favor Democrats regardless.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the Republican primary in Michigan’s 3rd District, the most competitive seat in this batch of races, former Trump administration official John Gibbs challenged Rep. Peter Meijer, one of 10 House Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who voted to impeach</a> Trump in 2021. Meijer <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-3-pro-impeachment-house-republicans-survive-tuesdays-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a huge spending advantage</a> in the primary, where a financial edge <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/F84C395D7155C9C0D82971BC0BFC75E8/S0003055422000764a.pdf/div-class-title-competition-in-congressional-elections-money-versus-votes-div.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can matter most;</a> Gibbs <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-congress-michigan-grand-rapids-impeachments-bfbb4564f73f2afdda6c5dbcb969c4ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had Trump’s endorsement</a>. Gibbs may have also received a boost from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/26/1113659467/dccc-meijier-gibbs-michigan-gop-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads run by</a> the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that ostensibly attacked him as “too conservative for West Michigan.” After Gibbs <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2022PRI_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly edged</a> Meijer by 3.5 percentage points, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast swung</a> from clearly favoring the GOP — we had Meijer as the default nominee until then — to favoring Democrat Hillary Scholten, whom Meijer <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2020GEN_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated in 2020</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/peter-meijer-freshman-republican-impeach/620844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative anger toward Meijer</a> over impeachment and Trump’s endorsement of Gibbs made the primary race highly competitive from the get-go. Still, the DCCC’s spending probably didn’t hurt Gibbs, either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite Republicans being a longer shot, Democratic interference may have also tipped the scales in New Hampshire. The Republican primary for U.S. Senate saw a great deal of outside spending in the final weeks before deciding who would face potentially vulnerable Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. While they didn’t name retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc in their ads, Democratic-aligned groups <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/democratic-groups-spend-money-on-republican-primaries-to-nominate-less-appealing-opponents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent millions attacking</a> Bolduc’s main opponent, state Senate President Chuck Morse. National Republicans, meanwhile, spent millions to boost Morse <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/31/republican-super-pac-2-million-new-hampshire-senate-primary-00054402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the hopes of defeating</a> Bolduc, whom New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a fellow Republican, <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2022-08-19/sununu-says-he-wont-endorse-conspiracy-theory-type-bolduc-in-senate-republican-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">labeled</a> a “conspiracy-theory type” candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bolduc went on to finish <em>just</em> ahead of Morse, 37 percent to 36 percent. Morse <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-races-to-watch-in-new-hampshire-and-rhode-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had outraised Bolduc</a> and had ample outside support, and while <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-races-to-watch-in-new-hampshire-and-rhode-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolduc led</a> Morse in primary polls, <a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NewHampshireRepublicanSurvey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sizable number</a> of undecided voters in the campaign’s final weeks <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1701&amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested serious uncertainty</a> about the outcome. And the GOP’s crowded Senate primary race may have been more important to Bolduc’s victory than Democratic spending, as it <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/14/new-hampshire-election-analysis-dante-scala-gop-primary-maga-success/10377427002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complicated Morse’s ability to form</a> an anti-Bolduc coalition and helped Bolduc to eke out a win with a plurality of support.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in New Hampshire’s 2nd District, Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-hampshire/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is favored over</a> former Hillsborough County Treasurer Robert Burns. In the Republican primary, Burns faced Keene Mayor George Hansel, an abortion-rights supporter who outraised Burns and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00821652/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received outside backing</a> from a Republican PAC <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/detail/2022?cmte=C00821652&amp;tab=targeted_candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that opposed Trumpy candidates</a> in GOP primaries. But a Democratic-aligned group <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00774463/1634542/se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poured money</a> into ads ostensibly attacking Burns as an “unapologetic conservative.” Burns only won by 3 points, 33 percent to 30 percent; however, here too a crowded primary field probably helped the Trumpiest candidate. Moreover, while the 2nd District is highly competitive turf, Hansel would have been far from a sure bet to win himself, as Kuster has held the seat for five terms, including a <a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2014/11/05/it-s-official-kuster-re/36004635007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reelection victory</a> during 2014’s red wave.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Maryland and Illinois, the bluest-leaning races, it’s harder to say Democratic spending dramatically altered either the Republican primaries or the general election picture. (Both Democratic candidates are clear favorites, and given their states’ blue hues, would’ve likely been favored to some extent regardless of their opponent.) Illinois’s Democratic governor, J.B. Pritzker, and affiliated groups spent more than $30 million during the primary to portray state Sen. Darren Bailey as a pro-Trump Republican and attack his main GOP rival. Now, these ads probably benefited Bailey at least a bit as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/21-republican-primaries-and-a-special-election-to-watch-on-june-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his polling position improved</a> amid these efforts, and he went on to receive Trump’s endorsement. But Bailey also had <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/illinois-governors-race-is-also-battle-among-billionaires/2866399/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ample financial support</a> from GOP megadonor Richard Uihlein, and he ended up winning the primary by such a large margin — 42 points — that it’s difficult to imagine Bailey failing to win even if Democrats hadn’t become involved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Maryland, the Democratic Governors Association <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/02/dems-trump-hogan-maryland-00043837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent more than $1 million</a> portraying state Del. Dan Cox as “too close to Trump.” Cox, an election denier who <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/01/07/del-cox-arranged-buses-to-violent-trump-rally-calls-vice-president-a-traitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chartered buses to the Jan. 6 attack</a> on the U.S. Capitol, <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/11/22/with-trumps-backing-dan-coxs-gubernatorial-bid-gains-national-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had Trump’s endorsement, while</a> former Maryland Secretary of Commerce Kelly Schulz had the support of <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/11/whitmers-approval-ticks-up-in-michigan-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular outgoing</a> Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. Despite being significantly outraised by Shultz, Cox wound up defeating his opponent 52 percent to 43 percent in the July 19 primary, and is now <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a huge underdog</a> against Democrat Wes Moore.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for Pennsylvania, the gubernatorial contest arguably should have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-gop-could-make-or-break-its-chances-in-10-key-governors-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the GOP’s best chance at victory</a> out of these six races. But Republican voters opted for state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a far-right candidate who <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/doug-mastriano-governor-christian-nationalism-qanon-20220504.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has embraced Christian nationalism</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/14/politics/trump-pennsylvania-mastriano-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked to overturn</a> the 2020 election results and <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-video-appears-to-show-state-sen-mastriano-closer-to-capitol-riot-than-he-said/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was on the grounds</a> of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Throughout the primary campaign, Democratic gubernatorial nominee and state Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Pennsylvania Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2022/05/18/takeaways-from-the-biggest-primary-night-of-the-year-00033345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent close to $1 million</a> on ads portraying Mastriano as “one of Donald Trump’s strongest supporters.” (Trump wound up <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-endorses-doug-mastriano-ahead-of-pennsylvania-gop-governor-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing his support</a> for Mastriano just days before the May 17 primary.) Shapiro is a strong bet to defeat Mastriano in November, as he holds about an 11-point edge <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our polling average</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But before Democrats take all the credit — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/19/mastriano-pennsylvania-governor-race-00046423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or blame</a> — for Mastriano’s advancement, it doesn’t take a tremendous leap to imagine him capturing the GOP nomination without Democratic assistance. After all, Mastriano won the GOP primary by more than 20 points. Stop me if you’ve heard this before, but a more important factor may have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/16-gop-primaries-to-watch-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania-idaho-and-oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the crowded primary field</a>, which hampered attempts by anti-Mastriano Republicans to coalesce around one candidate. In fact, a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-republican-governor-doug-mastriano-election-20220510.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last-minute effort</a> by Pennsylvania Republican insiders to stop Mastriano failed in part because they couldn’t coax Mastriano’s main rivals to drop out and rally behind one candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hindsight may help assess whether Democratic involvement affected some or all of these races, but it’s clear that myriad factors influenced the primary outcomes. And even if Democrats shifted each race and improved their chances, perhaps only New Hampshire’s Senate contest would notably affect which party controls either chamber of Congress and the nation’s governorships. Whether all this was worth the intangible cost of aiding candidates who mostly deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election while Congress works to unravel the events of Jan. 6 is another matter entirely.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Winning the House of Representatives was supposed to be a gimme for Republicans this year. Democrats’ current majority is just <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight seats</a>. And since the end of World War II, the president’s party has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost 26 House seats</a> in the average midterm election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while Republicans are still favored to flip the chamber, they are no longer the sure bets they once were. That’s because the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national political environment</a> has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved for Democrats</a>, likely partially due to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and end the constitutional right to abortion. According to the Deluxe version of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All numbers in this article are as of Oct. 14 at 10 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> Republicans have a 70-in-100 chance of taking control of the House, and Democrats have a 30-in-100 chance. In other words, Democrats have about the same chance of winning the House as Houston Astros second baseman <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/altuvjo01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">José Altuve</a> has of getting a base hit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At those odds, the chamber is legitimately competitive, which places extra weight on every swing seat. But which seats should we pay attention to? Thankfully, the FiveThirtyEight model can tell us. Along with win probabilities, the model spits out the odds<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find these odds by scrolling to the bottom of the forecast page, downloading the “Model outputs” and opening the file “house_district_toplines_2022.csv” (or, for the Senate, “senate_state_toplines_2022.csv”). The tipping-point probabilities for each seat are listed in the “tipping” column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> that each district will be the “tipping-point seat” in the House, or the seat that clinches a majority for the winning party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the election, imagine that you order all 435 House districts from the biggest Republican victory to the biggest Democratic victory. The 218th seat is the tipping-point seat because it is the House’s median seat by partisanship. Therefore, the party that wins the tipping-point seat, and every seat that is the same color behind it, has won the House. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The FiveThirtyEight model simulates the election 40,000 times. Here are the 10 House seats that were the tipping points most often in those simulations.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Immediately, you can tell why Republicans are favored — but not guaranteed — to retake the House. The GOP is favored in nine of these 10 seats<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including the Arizona 2nd, by a fraction of a percentage point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> — but Republicans’ average chance of victory across these districts is just 60-in-100. Republicans are also helped because the battle for the House takes place on light-red turf. The <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021-22 congressional redistricting process</a> largely preserved a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning status quo</a>. According to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/partisan-lean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan lean metric</a>,<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> seven of the 10 most likely tipping-point districts are more Republican-leaning than the nation as a whole. Their average partisan lean is R+2.7.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/oregon-elect-republican-governor-fivethirtyeight-91521213</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">These 10 seats also clearly show that the path to a House majority runs through the suburbs and exurbs. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of population density in these districts, all but the rural Arizona 2nd and urban Michigan 10th are predominantly suburban and/or exurban. The suburbs and exurbs have increasingly become <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where elections are won and lost</a> as the country <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">realigns along urban-rural lines</a> — cities get bluer and the countryside gets redder. And that trend looks like it will continue in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The list reflects how decisive open seats could be in the House too. Around 30 Democrats decided not to run for reelection to the House this year. That’s significantly more than the number of Republicans who retired or ran for another office. Six were also <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X97S6hUby6PPHAMoEwvAxkAUo8EUwLk8xMosx4hVd8c/htmlview?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated in primaries</a>, and two of those (sort of) appear on our list of likely tipping-point seats. In the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/oregon/5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oregon 5th</a>, a progressive Democrat, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, defeated Rep. Kurt Schrader, and Rep. Andy Levin left the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan 10th</a> behind in order to seek reelection in a bluer seat, which he lost in a primary to Rep. Haley Stevens. Two completely new, and therefore incumbent-less, seats were also created by redistricting, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/colorado/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado 8th</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/north-carolina/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina 13th</a>. Finally, one seat on our list is open because of a Republican retirement, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York 22nd</a> (where Rep. John Katko <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/19/new-york-election-katko-00052484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would likely have run</a>). That seat illustrates how Republicans can’t just play offense this cycle — they also have to tend to their own backyard. If Democrats flip enough Republican-held seats, they could keep the House even if they lose a few of their own.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And the other five seats show how crucial incumbents will be to each party’s chances. Four are Democratic incumbents: Rep. Tom Malinowski in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-jersey/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey 7th</a>, Rep. Cindy Axne in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/iowa/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa 3rd</a>, Rep. Tom O’Halleran in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/arizona/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona 2nd</a> and Rep. Susan Wild in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania 7th</a>. But incumbency can also come with baggage. For instance, O’Halleran is a <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/politicalinsider/2014/05/16/independent-candidate-chester-crandell/9150667/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Republican</a> with a <a href="https://voteview.com/person/21739/thomas-c-o-halleran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate voting record</a> in the House. That could be why Democrats still have a chance in Arizona’s 2nd, which became solidly red in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>. But Malinowski has been dogged by an Office of Congressional Ethics finding that he may have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-malinowski-stock-trades-congress-ethics-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violated conflict-of-interest laws</a> by failing to disclose <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-malinowski-stock-trades-congress-transparency-new-jersey-2021-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal stock trades</a>. He’s also facing a strong Republican recruit in the general election, former state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., the son of a former governor. Finally, the last likely tipping-point seat has a Republican incumbent: Rep. Yvette Herrell in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-mexico/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Mexico 2nd</a>. Her presence on the list demonstrates how Republicans are counting on the handful of incumbents they have in Democratic-leaning seats to hold on to make their climb to 218 easier.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is one other thing these 10 districts have in common. It isn’t something that should worry Republicans or Democrats — but rather us election watchers. There hasn’t been much polling in them. We’ve unearthed only 29 polls across the 10 districts, and 19 were partisan polls, leaving us with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a potentially skewed picture of the campaigns</a>. The model accounts for this skew, but we’d rather have independent polls. As a result, our Deluxe forecasts for these 10 districts give more weight to non-polling factors like district partisanship, incumbency and expert ratings. That increases the chances that the election result will surprise us. All the more reason not to take your eyes off the House this midterm cycle.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Our generation grew up watching as the climate crisis got worse and worse and politicians did nothing.” That might sound like a quote from teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, but it’s actually the opening line for <a href="https://www.lcvvictoryfund.org/lcvvf-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new series of political ads</a> appearing in multiple states in the lead-up to the 2022 midterms — ads that the advocacy groups Climate Power Action and the League of Conservation Voters are hoping will tip the scales towards climate-focused Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe loading="lazy" title="Abigail Spanberger: Generation (30s)" width="712" height="401" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPQGMSue4F8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div> 



<p data-paragraph="main">Historically, however, climate change has not been much of a political kingmaker. Even when candidates <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/14/democrats-climate-change-midterms-824745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trusted that their constituents <em>did</em> care deeply about the environment</a>, it hasn’t been something that reliably changed votes. In the 2020 presidential election, for example, two-thirds of voters told exit pollster Edison Research that climate change was a “serious problem” — but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/18/energy-202-so-how-much-did-climate-change-matter-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 percent of that same group voted for then-President Donald Trump</a>, a candidate whose position on climate change was … <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51213003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inconsistent</a> … at best. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So <a href="https://www.lcvvictoryfund.org/news/climate-power-action-lcv-victory-fund-announce-12-million-strategic-paid-media-and-direct-mail-campaign-to-turn-out-two-million-climate-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $12 million ad campaign</a> aimed specifically at promoting Democratic candidates’ climate change bona fides seems, at first glance, like a fool’s errand. But even though the content of these ads makes it clear they’re meant for a narrow audience — young voters, who see themselves as part of a generation bearing the consequences of inaction on climate change — the ads aren’t even for <em>all</em> of them. Instead, the groups funding these ads are trying to reach a specific sliver of a slice of a subset of young voters. And yet there’s reason to think that, on those slender margins, climate change could be becoming an issue that really sways elections. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">One thing definitely working in favor of climate change as a voting issue this year is the existence of actual legislative change on climate, said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Attempts to reach out to voters on climate issues are happening in context with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden’s spending bill that includes a number of tax breaks, new regulations, financing and incentives focused on <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23281757/whats-in-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reducing the country’s carbon emissions</a> over the long term. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/oregon-elect-republican-governor-fivethirtyeight-91521213</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The passage of that bill is genuinely a big deal, Leiserowitz said. Outside of that, “there has been little to no major national action on climate change. And I’ve been doing this for 30 years,” he told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The passage of the IRA is in keeping with what voters say they want. A large majority of Democratic voters think the Biden administration and Congress need to be doing more to deal with climate change — 82 percent according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/07/14/americans-divided-over-direction-of-bidens-climate-change-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center survey from May</a>. And that same report found that 58 percent of all Americans felt that the federal government wasn’t doing enough to combat climate change. Given results like that, it would be easy to assume that the passage of a federal bill finally addressing climate would be something that could really motivate voters — at least the liberal-leaning ones.<br><br>But the relationship between voters and climate policy has long fallen under the label of “it’s complicated.” There is an established gap between what voters say they want — action on climate change — and what they’re willing to do to achieve that. In 2019, for example, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-climatechange/americans-demand-climate-action-reuters-poll-idUSKCN1TR15W" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling by Reuters and Ipsos</a> found that while 69 percent of Americans wanted the government to take “aggressive” action on climate change, only 42 percent were likely to install solar panels on their own home; 38 percent were likely to begin carpooling to reduce emissions; and just 34 percent were likely to pay an extra $100 a year in taxes to support climate policies. And in 13 years of YouGov polls <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/most-important-issues-facing-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracking which issues registered voters see as the most important</a>, climate change has consistently taken a back seat to economic issues like jobs and inflation. As of Oct. 10, 12 percent of voters listed climate change and the environment as their No. 1 concern, while 22 percent cited inflation and high prices. It’s not that emphasizing climate change is a turn-off for voters — President Biden got a solid B+ on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIi4iCw2EuaO0B7X_J-e7cZlAuyzMba2vFUwA1GF6gQ/edit#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenpeace’s 2020 election Climate Scorecard</a>. But neither is climate an issue that seems to attract voters on its own. Having the highest score on the Greenpeace scorecard during his candidacy was not enough to catapult Washington’s Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, to the White House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That history is probably why ads touting climate change policy have been relatively rare this campaign cycle. Of the nearly 350 ad campaigns the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics is tracking in this midterm election, <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-2022-ad-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion and crime have been the primary issues</a> at play, to the point that the center’s most recent analysis doesn’t even mention climate. Even in the month of September, after the passage of the IRA, ads focused on energy and the environment were still playing third fiddle to other issues like crime and inflation, according to <a href="https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/issues-sept22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from the Wesleyan Media Project</a>, which documents details of political advertising. The project found that 15 percent of nationwide political ads in September were focused on energy and environmental issues (which could include climate change), compared to 26 percent of ads focused on public safety and 19 percent on inflation. Even among the ads created by the LCV, some aren’t about climate change or the IRA, specifically — instead talking more broadly about <a href="https://youtu.be/pWCTnI5tQkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how a specific candidate fits with the Democratic platform</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the main goal of the LCV’s ad campaign appears to be persuading people to vote for a candidate <em>because</em> that person has gotten climate policy done — something that’s presented in the ads as a bit of a surprise, a “can you believe they actually did it?” moment. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc4046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Years of research</a> have shown that the persuasion effects created by advertising — whether <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political</a> or <a href="https://www.williamrinehart.com/2019/advertising-uneasy-persuasion-or-means-of-social-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">otherwise</a> — <a href="https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/quickly-forget-duration-persuasion-effects-mass-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not last very long</a>, and <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2020/09/02/political-ads-have-little-persuasive-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they are very small</a>, capable of maybe creating a percentage-point difference in swing, said Lynn Vavreck, a professor of politics and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. “But don’t confuse small in size with not being pivotal,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because while the voting public as a whole has this messy situationship with climate change, there’s a segment of Democratic-leaning voters for whom it is increasingly the real deal. Young and left-leaning voters <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/most-important-issues-facing-the-us?crossBreak=democrat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were most likely to rank climate change</a> as their No. 1 issue in the most recent YouGov poll from Oct. 10. Eighteen percent of voters under 30 and 19 percent of Democrats said it’s the most important issue facing the U.S., compared to 11 percent of voters 65 and older, and just 2 percent of Republicans. And in the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos panel survey</a> conducted between April and September using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, as much as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36 percent of Democrats</a> named climate change as one of the country’s top issues.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents could select up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Young people have the strongest beliefs about the reality of climate change and the need to take action on it, said Charlotte Hill, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. That <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/15/gop-climage-change-generation-gap-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trend is so strong that it even crosses party lines</a>: Forty-seven percent of voting-age Republicans under 30 told Pew in May that the government was doing too little to combat climate change, compared to just 18 percent of Republicans 65 and older. But young (and particularly young, left-leaning) voters are such good targets for these ads because they are also <a href="https://about.bgov.com/brief/election-demographics-and-voter-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the age group least likely to turn out for a midterm election</a>. And “it’s also pretty consistent that <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/why-youth-dont-vote-differences-race-and-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the top reason that young people cite</a> for not voting is not liking the candidates or the issues,” Hill said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Targeting the people who care the most about climate change, and are the least likely to just go out and vote on their own, with ads that tell them politicians are actually acting on their desires can produce the kind of small differences that tip the scales in some elections, Hill and Vavreck said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the LCV campaign took this one step further, by targeting ads at 2 million specific voters who live in the districts where that tiny margin of change will matter the most, including <a href="https://www.lcv.org/article/climate-power-action-lcv-victory-fund-announce-12-million-strategic-paid-media-and-direct-mail-campaign-to-turn-out-two-million-climate-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven states where the statewide Senate race is a tight one</a> — Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The model is based off of similar microtargeting work from the 2020 presidential election, when the goal was to persuade undecided voters who cared a lot about climate issues to cast their ballot in favor of Biden, said Pete Maysmith, senior vice president of campaigns at LCV. Those voters approved of Trump more than Biden, but the targeted ads seem to have convinced at least a portion of them to vote Democrat. Based on post-election surveys and a controlled experiment, LCV believes they increased Biden’s vote margin by 5.6 percentage points, relative to the control population. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nobody knows yet how big a difference the group will be able to make with this latest round of micro-targeted ads. But evidence suggests that small can be big, and that fact changes the stakes on climate change advertising. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">For the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past few weeks</a>, we’ve been trying to figure out to what extent, if any, Republicans have regained ground in the race for control of Congress. And the answer is … probably some, but not necessarily as much as the conventional wisdom holds.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a>,<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday at 11 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> the GOP now has a 34 percent chance of recapturing the Senate. That’s up from a low of 29 percent in mid-September.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In betting markets, there’s <a href="https://electionbettingodds.com/Senate2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been a much sharper shift</a>. In fact, the markets have the race at nearly even, with Republicans having a 49 percent chance of Senate control. That’s up from a low of 33 percent in late August. The markets were in pretty good alignment with FiveThirtyEight’s forecast for most of the cycle; now they’re not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How come? Well, as I wrote two weeks ago, I don’t think it’s crazy for the markets to be concerned about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systematic polling bias</a>. It’s also not crazy for markets to have anticipated some fallout for Democrats from Thursday morning’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/13/business/inflation-cpi-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worse-than-expected inflation report</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the gap between the markets and the models is big — and growing. And it’s not just FiveThirtyEight’s model. <a href="https://forecast.decisiondeskhq.com/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://projects.jhkforecasts.com/2022-midterms/senate-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">models</a> are similar or don’t even show a Republican rebound at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I wouldn’t care about this much if there had been a <em>steady</em> gap between the markets and the models. If the markets want to take the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hypothesis of predictable polling bias</a> more seriously than the models do, or to put more weight on the long <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history of the president’s party having a poor midterm</a>, that’s fine by me. Aggregating different hypotheses is a strength of markets generally.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The markets and the models are also telling very different stories about the <em>trajectory</em> of the race, though — and I think this gets at two potential ways in which political betting markets sometimes <em>aren’t</em> that smart.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One weakness of these markets is that they tend to follow the media narrative about the race more so than they do the underlying evidence. The source for this claim: yours truly, because I’ve been doing this for a <em>very</em> long time.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most prominent case was in the 2012 presidential election cycle, when Republican Mitt Romney gained ground on Barack Obama after the first debate but then the polls reverted to showing a fairly clear Obama lead, even as &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/oct-24-in-polls-romneys-momentum-seems-to-have-stopped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;media coverage still claimed that Romney had “momentum.”&lt;/a&gt; The models were &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nate-silver-election-odds-2012-10-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;quicker to figure this out than the markets&lt;/a&gt;, although to be fair, the markets were still quicker than &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/nate-silver-joe-scarborough-wanna-bet/321880/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;morning-television-news hosts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>17</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">My impression for the past few weeks is that media coverage has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-still-do-not-show-a-gop-bounce-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaning into the Republican-rebound</a> story. (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">So has ours</a>, to be unhypocritical about this.) And in some ways, this coverage is justified. Republicans have unambiguously gained ground in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a> Senate races — and those are important contests! The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steady improvement in political fortunes</a> that Democrats experienced in the summer is over.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the Republican position hasn’t really improved in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a>’s Senate race, and Herschel Walker has probably lost ground in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a>. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>, momentum is murky, and any poll movement is hard to distinguish from statistical noise. The <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s approval rating</a> have also not shifted very much. The outlook in the House continues to favor Republicans but <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t changed much in either direction</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a messy story. People tend not to click on headlines such as “Republicans Gaining Ground In A Few Key Senate Races, But With A Setback In Georgia; National Trends Unclear, Perhaps Some Hint Of A Republican Rebound, But It Could Just Be Noise ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other weakness in these prediction markets is that the traders don’t have a lot of technical sophistication about <em>election forecasting</em>. That’s not to say they aren’t sophisticated in general. Traders may know a lot about politics, they may have a good sense for market psychology, and they may be smart people who are good <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general-purpose estimators</a>. But there are some questions for which <em>actually going through the process of building a model</em> helps a lot, such as in determining how much an election forecast should shift in response to a modest but noisy shift in the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most of these traders aren’t building election models themselves. I’m confident about that, because I know the sort of people who bet on elections. Poker players, sports bettors, quantitatively minded academics — they all have a lot of overlap with Nate World and I often encounter them in personal and professional settings. They’ll mention that they bet on elections, they’ll mention that they follow FiveThirtyEight and other forecasts, but they <em>usually</em><a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are exceptions, but I imagine they come less from individual traders and more from institutions such as hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> aren’t building election models from scratch.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nor should they be building them, frankly, because doing so wouldn’t be greatly time-consuming. Building a halfway decent election model would take — I’d estimate from my own experience — a couple of months of hard work if you had a lot of help, and more than that if you didn’t. It’s not a great investment when an election is held only once every other year. You’d be better off working on models to do options trading or to bet on football, where there’s more liquidity and more frequent opportunities to make money.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A lot of the value the models provide, as I mentioned, is in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking at <em>all</em> the polls</a> and not just the ones that get highlighted in the media, which are often a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1940161219864295" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly nonrepresentative sample</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The models also understand an important fact about midterms: They tend <em>not </em>to turn on a dime, in the way that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential elections sometimes do</a>. (Although even for presidential elections, most <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/2012-election-game-changers-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“game changers” are false alarms</a>.) If you hear about momentum shifts in midterms, you should generally be wary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why? Well, voters aren’t paying all that much attention. Yes, you’re paying attention because you’re a FiveThirtyEight reader. But the general public pays much less attention to midterms than to presidential elections. Take a look, for example, at <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google searches for the word “polls”</a>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1787" height="916" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-14-at-10.15.53-AM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-14-at-10.15.53-AM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-14-at-10.15.53-AM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-14-at-10.15.53-AM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The spikes for presidential elections are much bigger, about three or four times bigger. People certainly notice big stories such as inflation or Roe v. Wade being overturned, but they aren’t following daily news stories in the way they do in presidential years. What happens on cable news tends to stay on cable news.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why, we’ve found, you should be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-a-new-less-volatile-version-of-our-generic-ballot-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautious in interpreting shifts in the generic ballot</a>; your default should be to assume that the public’s preference for which party controls Congress is fairly steady, even more so than for whom they’d like to see elected president. It takes a lot to move the needle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another dissimilarity between midterms and presidential elections is more obvious but still worth mentioning: There are different candidates on the ballot in every state and district. A scandal involving Biden or former President Donald Trump will spill over into every state; one involving Herschel Walker will probably have an impact only in Georgia. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-new-polling-averages-show-biden-leads-trump-by-9-points-nationally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlike in presidential races</a>, it is very much <em>not</em> safe to make inferences about how one state is moving based on how others are; a change in the polls in Pennsylvania tells you approximately nothing about one in Arizona.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s probably bad for FiveThirtyEight site traffic to say this, but the final few weeks of the midterm campaign may not be all that climactic or action-packed. Certainly, a lot of the individual races are quite fascinating, but “October surprises” that affect one race may not affect others. There may be some changes in the big-picture, topline numbers, but probably not huge ones. And that means we’ll enter Election Day with a lot of uncertainty about which party will emerge with control of Congress.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden’s surprise <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marijuana reform announcement</a> last week has mostly gotten attention for pardoning thousands convicted of simple possession of marijuana, a move that many observers have called <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/10/biden-marijuana-pardon-possession-impact-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a small step</a> towards criminal justice reform. But it’s the mostly overlooked second part of Biden’s announcement — a directive to reevaluate pot’s federal status as a Schedule I drug — that has the potential to change the future of American cannabis policy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Schedule I is the federal government’s most tightly controlled drug classification, reserved for extremely dangerous substances with high potential for abuse and no medical use. That doesn’t describe pot, Biden declared last week, and he is now asking his own administration to start the process of making the drug’s legal classification match its reality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reevaluation is more than just an empty gesture. Experts like John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said there’s a very good chance of Biden’s directive leading to actual reform — not decades from now, but by the end of his current term in office. “This is not just a blue-ribbon commission putting together a report,” Hudak said. “This is a formal legal process that is required in order for the executive branch to consider a change in scheduling.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Biden just triggered a process that could end federal pot prohibition as we know it. </p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marijuana landed in Schedule I in 1970, when Congress first passed the Controlled Substances Act, a law that dictates federal drug policy and created five “schedules” under which substances could be classified. Pot’s placement was meant to be only a temporary designation, while officials waited for scientists to finish research on the plant and its effects. But in 1972, after then-Attorney General John Mitchell <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-behind-the-dea-s-long-war-on-marijuana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overruled</a> the scientific commission’s <a href="https://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/nc/ncrec1_17.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendation to decriminalize</a>, marijuana became a permanent Schedule I drug. The decision would later become infamous when interviews with aides to former President Richard Nixon and recordings from Nixon’s White House tapes showed that the administration was using that classification as a way to criminalize, in <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the words of former Nixon aide John Ehrlichman</a>, the “antiwar left and Black people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the sordid history of pot’s scheduling, cannabis has been paralyzed in Schedule I status for more than 50 years because of a legal dilemma created by the law itself. Before pot can be downgraded to a lower schedule, there needs to be scientific evidence that cannabis can be used safely and has at least some medical uses. But the Schedule I status itself severely limits any research into the drug: Subsequent reviews have inevitably failed to find enough evidence to reschedule the drug.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Pot’s Schedule I status remains the most powerful force in American cannabis policy, even as millions of Americans gain access to medical marijuana through state markets. Schedule I is why federal agents can arrest people for smoking a single joint. It’s why scientists can’t easily study the drug. It’s why most banks won’t lend money to marijuana startups and why pot companies pay some of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/04/30/state-legal-cannabis-companies-pays-insane-tax-rates-thanks-to-a-minnesota-speed-dealer/?sh=7527b2ea1008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest federal tax rates</a> in the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moving a drug to a different schedule is a lengthy bureaucratic process — previous reviews of pot’s CSA classification took between six and 22 years to complete, Hudak said. But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/06/biden-marijuana-decriminalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he and other experts</a> think that this reclassification could happen much faster. That’s because Biden is approaching this declassification in a unique — and powerful — way. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That starts with how the president announced his plans. Biden publicly told his appointees that he wants this done “expeditiously,” pressuring his officials to act before his term ends in 2024. “The president is messaging to those appointees — and the appointees will totally understand it — that this is something he wants done [quickly],” Hudak said. In contrast, former President Barack Obama <a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/30/just-released-cnns-jake-tapper-exclusive-interview-with-president-obama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused</a> to take this administrative action, telling reporters that a schedule change had to come from Congress. Biden not only directed his agencies to conduct this review, but announced it by saying that Schedule I “<a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1578097880744820736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes no sense</a>” for pot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The process will begin with the Food and Drug Administration conducting a scientific evaluation of cannabis. This study will look at eight different aspects of the drug, including the substance’s pharmacological effects, public health risks and potential for abuse. The FDA will send this information to the secretary of Health and Human Services, who will then make a recommendation to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The HHS secretary can recommend that pot remain a Schedule I drug, be moved to a lower, less restrictive schedule or be removed entirely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Attorney General Merrick Garland and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra are already taking up the charge. Becerra <a href="https://twitter.com/SecBecerra/status/1578117950816616458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted hours</a> after Biden’s announcement (at 4:20 p.m., in perhaps a nod to stoner culture) that he was “looking forward” to working with Garland to review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law. And the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-statement-president-s-announcements-regarding-simple-possession-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the same day that it is “expeditiously” reviewing pardons and working with HHS to review pot’s scheduling decision.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This forceful move by Biden has made legal experts like Daniel Shortt, a cannabis attorney based in Seattle, optimistic about the chances marijauna could be removed from Schedule I. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This is the most consequential piece of federal cannabis policy since 1937, when federal pot prohibition began,” Shortt said. “However long this process takes, it’s going to end with a significantly different approach to federal prohibition.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there are many ways Biden’s scheduling directive could fail. Chief among them is the evaluation of marijuana’s medical effectiveness. This isn’t the first time the federal government has reviewed pot’s Schedule I status. The DOJ and HHS have studied the issue <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple times</a> and each review has concluded the same way: with the FDA declaring that pot is dangerous and has no accepted medical use, and the DOJ refusing to remove cannabis from Schedule I.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As recently as 2016, the FDA ruled that marijuana had not demonstrated medical value — but there have been major medical cannabis developments in the last six years. Nearly half of oncologists reported recommending medical cannabis to their cancer patients, according to a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29746226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> conducted in 2016 and 2017. And the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the country’s leading academic body for scientific research, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425767/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concluded</a> in 2017 that there is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even the FDA has updated its opinion on the medical use of cannabinoids. In 2018, the agency <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-drug-comprised-active-ingredient-derived-marijuana-treat-rare-severe-forms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> Epidiolex, a pharmaceutical cannabinoid derived from cannabis plants, to treat rare forms of epilepsy. Epidiolex showed benefits in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, effectively proving through the gold standard of medical research that pot can have medical value. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The approval of Epidiolex could be the most important development in changing the FDA’s opinion about pot by demonstrating that cannabis has “medical value and accepted medical use,” Hudak said. But Matt Zorn, an attorney <a href="https://filtermag.org/dea-cancels-psychedelics-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has handled multiple cases against DEA’s scheduling decisions</a>, said it wasn’t clear if Epidiolex would be a slam dunk for rescheduling cannabis. The agency could decide that a pharmaceutical <em>derived</em> from cannabis is categorically different from cannabis itself.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there is power in the president clearly and decisively asking for change. Politics inevitably creeps into the FDA’s scientific review and scheduling recommendation, Hudak said. And this is the first time the president himself, rather than an outside group, has requested a reevaluation of pot. This will likely push the agencies to make a different decision simply “because their boss told them to,” Shortt said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And not only is the president on record supporting pot — both of Biden’s appointees have a history of defending cannabis. In his 2021 confirmation hearings, Garland, who will eventually make the ultimate scheduling decision as the head of the DOJ, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?508877-1/attorney-general-confirmation-hearing-day-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> enforcing federal marijuana law as an ineffective use of federal resources and racially discriminatory in its effect.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Becerra is an even bigger advocate for cannabis reform. As a member of Congress, Becerra repeatedly voted to <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bidens-health-secretary-pick-could-help-reclassify-marijuana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block the DOJ from interfering</a> with medical marijuana programs and to <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2014418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow cannabis businesses</a> to access banking. As California’s attorney general, Becerra helped <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/MEDICINAL%20CANNABIS%20Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">administer</a> the state’s medical marijuana program and he attacked pot’s Schedule I status, telling the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-ol-patt-morrison-xavier-bacerra-20170208-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles Times</a> in 2017 that “The federal government has to catch up and get into the 21st century.” It’s hard to see how Becerra could possibly recommend that pot remain a Schedule I substance, Hudak said, given everything Becerra has fought for over the last decade. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In theory, a drug’s scheduling should be guided by scientists making decisions based on the best available data. But politics has always affected federal drug policy, whether it’s Nixon outlawing pot in the 1970s or Congress creating the<a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/cracks-system-20-years-unjust-federal-crack-cocaine-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> discriminatory <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/cracks-system-20-years-unjust-federal-crack-cocaine-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disparity between crack and cocaine penalties</a>. But this time, with Biden’s announcement, the politics are in pot’s favor.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, President Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-pardons-thousands-convicted-federal-marijuana-possession/story?id=91122888" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pardoned federal offenses</a> for marijuana possession, part of a promise he had made on the campaign trail to decriminalize weed. The order to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/06/granting-pardon-for-the-offense-of-simple-possession-of-marijuana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacate the sentences</a> of at least 6,500 American citizens and lawful permanent residents <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/10/1127708285/marijuana-pardon-biden-black-people-war-on-drugs-harm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elicited praise</a> from some cannabis advocates, while others have said the move is <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/10/biden-marijuana-pardon-possession-impact-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a first step</a> at best. Some activists, especially those who highlight how enforcement of the current law disproportionately targets Black communities, said the pardon <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/08/politics/biden-marijuana-possession-pardons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t go far enough</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, in general, Americans agree that the country’s legislation on marijuana does need an update. According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/05/most-voters-back-federal-marijuana-legalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling conducted by Morning Consult/Politico</a> just days before the Oct. 6 pardon, 6 in 10 American voters said weed should be legal in the U.S. That number rises to about 7 in 10 among voters under 45 (70 percent), Democrats (71 percent) and Black voters (72 percent). Even among the groups least likely to support legalizing marijuana — Republicans (47 percent) and voters 65 or over (45 percent) — close to half of respondents agreed. There’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-do-gop-lawmakers-still-oppose-legalizing-weed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no real divide</a> across regions, either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Current laws, however, do not reflect this sweeping bipartisan, universal support. The legalization of marijuana puts a spotlight on the divide between Americans and politicians, namely Republican members of Congress. Public opinion has changed drastically on this issue in the past two decades, but getting legislation to catch up with an updated national sentiment has not been easy, especially when the topic carries a century of social baggage. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for relaxed weed laws hasn’t always been so widespread. When <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1657/illegal-drugs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> surveyed Americans on the topic in March 1972, eight months after then-President Richard Nixon declared the nation’s infamous war on drugs, only 15 percent agreed that the use of marijuana should be legal. Meanwhile, in a separate Gallup survey conducted several days prior to that, just 11 percent said that they had tried marijuana. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">By April 1977, support for legalization reached 28 percent but mostly plateaued until 2000. Since then, however, support has risen considerably. As of October 2021, 68 percent of Americans said <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/396893/americans-not-convinced-marijuana-benefits-society.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marijuana use should be legal</a>, and in July, 48 percent of Americans said that they had tried it. In other words, those numbers are the highest they’ve been in five decades.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Biden’s order was popular with a <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/lawmakers-governors-and-advocates-react-to-biden-marijuana-pardon-and-scheduling-review-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide range of politicians</a>, it’s not the sweeping change that some Americans would like to see. For starters, not everyone has been on board, such as a handful of Republicans in Congress who have long pushed a hardline attitude against marijuana. For instance, just two weeks ago, a conservative caucus of House Republicans unveiled its <a href="https://banks.house.gov/uploadedfiles/rsc_family_policy_agenda.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Family Policy Agenda</a>, which suggested some sort of link between THC use and suicide in children and adolescents. And the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance, the highest tier in the agency’s hierarchy, deems it <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling#:~:text=Schedule%20I%20drugs%2C%20substances%2C%20or,Schedule%20II" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unacceptable even for medical use</a> at the federal level, at least for now. Biden also called on the Justice Department and Health and Human Services to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/06/1127302410/biden-pardon-marijuana-possession-convictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin a review</a> of marijuana’s current categorization.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the federal restrictions on marijuana use haven’t exactly held up on a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regional level</a>: Thirty-seven states, as well as Washington, D.C., and three U.S. territories have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes, while 19 states, Washington, D.C., and two territories have also done so for recreational use among adults. In other words, the federal law isn’t just out of touch with most Americans — it’s out of touch with most state legislation, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Biden’s pardon is ahead of the curve, as most states have yet not overturned state-level possession convictions. Following the order, the president called on governors to issue similar pardons, which would be a popular move: <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/10/07/d7bc7/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent polling from YouGov</a> found that 62 percent of Americans would back such a measure in their state. In fact, a majority of every demographic group tracked support it except Republicans (41 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Americans are nonetheless split, nearly down the middle, on whether marijuana use harms society at large. In July, 49 percent told <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/396893/americans-not-convinced-marijuana-benefits-society.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> that the impact was at least somewhat positive, while 50 percent said it was at least somewhat negative. Compared with their views on other controlled substances, though, this actually supports the idea that Americans feel positive about marijuana. For example, a whopping 75 percent of Americans say that alcohol use has at least a somewhat negative impact on society. In other words, it’s clear that sentiments among the American public are heading in a solid direction toward legalization. The question now is how long it will take for nationwide policies to reflect where the people stand.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Roughly half of registered voters (49 percent) said they’re more motivated than usual to cast their midterm ballots next month, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-october-2022/">Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking poll</a> conducted Sept. 15-26. That split ticks up slightly among partisan voters, with 57 percent of Republicans and 52 percent of Democrats in agreement. When KFF asked voters what issue they’d most like to hear candidates discuss, a plurality brought up economic concerns (35 percent), followed by abortion or reproductive rights (15 percent) and immigration (9 percent). </li></ul><ul><li>Despite all the buzz about critical race theory, a recent <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/poll-half-of-americans-know-little-about-crt-whats-actually-taught-in-schools/">survey from USC Dornsife</a> found that a slight majority have either never heard of CRT (36 percent) or have heard of it but don’t know what it means (15 percent). And just 4 percent said they knew enough about CRT to explain it to others. On the whole, nearly all Americans agree that certain topics should be covered in high school — like slavery (95 percent), contributions of women and people of color (94 percent) and racial inequality (86 percent). However, the consensus is less sweeping on trans rights (59 percent) and gender identity (59 percent). </li></ul><ul><li>An equal and majority share (66 percent) of both Democrats and Republicans think the other party should have more moderate candidates, per a Sept. 27-Oct. 2 <a href="https://www.moreincommon.com/media/i4xpxmbt/final-nbclx-midterm-survey_v1.pdf">poll by YouGov for the nonprofit More in Common</a>. But each side is less likely to agree that their own party needs moderate options: Only 32 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats say so. Meanwhile, white Americans overall (53 percent) were the most likely of any race or ethnic group to voice a need for more moderate Democrats, while Asian Americans overall (54 percent) were the most likely to say the same about the GOP. </li></ul><ul><li>Almost half of Americans view the country’s health care system overall in a negative light, according to recent <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/402191/majorities-rate-cost-equity-healthcare-negatively.aspx">polling from Gallup</a> that asked respondents to rank various attributes by letter grades (A, B, C, D or F). A whopping 75 percent consider the affordability of the system as either a D grade of “poor” (41 percent) or an F grade of “fail” (33 percent), which is a breakdown that doesn’t waver much along socioeconomic lines. Further, Black Americans (66 percent) and Asian Americans (64 percent) were the most likely groups to give a poor rating for getting equitable care, although women (61 percent) weren’t far behind. In fact, 55 percent of women also said that they’re not confident that their families will be able to afford the health care they need as they age, a much higher share than the 45 percent of men who agreed.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">In a dramatic ending on Thursday to the final scheduled public hearing of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, the committee <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-dramatic-details-latest-jan-hearing/story?id=91470367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously voted to subpoena former President Donald Trump</a>. “We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion, and every American is entitled to those answers,” said committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney ahead of the vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The subpoena means that Trump has been ordered by the committee to provide relevant documents and testimony under oath as part of its investigation. Given the former president’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-fires-back-jan-committee-calls-hearings-disgraceful/story?id=85463648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disdain for the committee</a>, it’s unlikely Trump will willingly testify. Still, the decision to subpoena a former president was remarkable and capped off a hearing that resurfaced evidence of Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 attack. And while today’s hearing might not have changed how people plan to vote, it was a reminder of the ugly reality of what could happen after they do. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While past congressional hearings have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-host-a-congressional-hearing-that-actually-like-does-something/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swayed public opinion</a>, that largely hasn’t been the case for the Jan. 6 committee. Polling of Americans before, during and after the hearings this summer showed negligible movement in opinions on the attack and Trump’s role in it. In late June, a few weeks into the public hearings, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_080922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Monmouth University poll found that</a> 65 percent of Americans considered the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol a riot, 50 percent called it an insurrection, and 34 percent said it was a legitimate protest. By the end of July, after the summer hearings had concluded, those numbers were virtually unchanged: 64 percent said Jan. 6 was a riot, 52 percent said it was an insurrection, and 35 percent said it was a legitimate protest. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The share of Americans who believe Trump is “directly responsible” for the attack hasn’t moved much either: Forty-two percent thought so in June, while 38 percent did in September, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_080922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to another set of Monmouth University polls</a>. Given that roughly a third of Americans — including a majority of Republicans — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/poll-61-republicans-still-believe-biden-didnt-win-fair-square-2020-rcna49630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still believe the 2020 election was stolen</a> from Trump despite the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-courts-election/fact-check-courts-have-dismissed-multiple-lawsuits-of-alleged-electoral-fraud-presented-by-trump-campaign-idUSKBN2AF1G1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mountain</a> of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence</a> to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/post-election-audits-are-normal-whats-happening-in-arizona-is-anything-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the contrary</a>, it’s perhaps not shocking that congressional hearings have struggled to move the needle. It’s also true that voters have a lot of other things on their minds right now. Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey</a> has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracking the issues Americans</a> find most important for the country heading into the election, and while Americans consider “political extremism or polarization” one of the top issues,<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents could select up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> they have consistently ranked it behind inflation. And the Americans who identified partisan extremism as a top issue facing the country weren’t necessarily <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-in-10-americans-named-political-polarization-as-a-top-issue-facing-the-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thinking about the Jan. 6 attacks</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But even if the hearing itself isn’t top of mind for voters, they will be impacted by the Jan. 6 attack and the events that preceded it. One such way is through the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of changes to state election laws</a>, many of which were passed with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-big-lie-voting-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the stated motivation</a> of securing elections and preventing fraud, inspired by Trump’s illegitimate claims after 2020. This fall, many voters across the country will be encountering new election laws that require them to show a photo I.D. when voting, register earlier than they used to or find a new place to return their ballot because their local drop box has been removed. Whether or not voters care about Jan. 6, it will affect them this November. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But perhaps the most direct influence of Jan. 6 and Trump’s campaign leading up to it are the hundreds of candidates on the ballot this fall who continue to repeat his allegations of a stolen election. As of Oct. 13 at 5 p.m. Eastern, 200 out of 552 Republican nominees for House, Senate, governor, state attorney general and secretary of state seats have fully denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s analysis</a>, and another 62 have raised doubts. The 200 includes individuals who actively supported Trump’s attempts to overturn the election results <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/06/29/updated-trumps-fake-electors-heres-the-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by signing on</a> to be illegitimate “alternate” electors and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/us/politics/jan-6-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attending the rally</a> that preceded the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If these candidates are elected, they’ll be in positions to meaningfully influence elections, whether as a state legislator passing voting laws or as a secretary of state tasked with administering and certifying elections. And if they aren’t elected, they could just take a page from Trump’s book and cry fraud. Many <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-denying-primary-candidates-are-crying-fraud-win-or-lose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election deniers who lost their primaries</a> did exactly that. And even a few who won did so, too. On a widespread scale, claiming fraud over an election loss could lead to more distrust in elections or, at worst, once again stoke violence. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the committee’s decision to subpoena Trump was extraordinary, it’s far from the kind of October surprise that swings elections. But the shockwaves from Jan. 6 — and from Trump’s baseless election fraud claims leading up to it — will continue to reverberate across the country, into November and beyond. </p>]]></description>

		</div>





<p data-paragraph="main">In the months since <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/15/pennsylvania-john-fetterman-stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Fetterman had a stroke</a>, the Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate seat has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/politics/fetterman-return-campaign-trail-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to the campaign trail</a> and started doing interviews — while his opponent’s attacks on his health have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/oz-escalates-attacks-fettermans-health-hostile-pennsylvania-senate-rac-rcna46457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown more and more intense</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Mehmet Oz, the Republican nominee, continues to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flounder in polls</a> and <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/oz-fetterman-announce-third-quarter-fundraising-numbers-in-pa-u-s-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising</a>, he’s taunted Fetterman about initially <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/07/fetterman-to-politico-i-will-debate-oz-00055301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declining to debate</a> and questioned whether his rival is using his stroke as an excuse to avoid a public faceoff. Now, Fetterman’s health is in the news again after the candidate — who’s currently serving as the state’s lieutenant governor — used closed-captioning technology during a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/fetterman-says-stroke-recovery-changes-everything-s-fit-serve-senator-rcna51498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent interview with NBC News</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fetterman said that as part of his recovery <a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/fetterman-addresses-criticism-over-need-for-closed-captioning-during-his-stroke-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he needed the technology</a>, which transcribed the reporters’ questions and displayed them on a screen for him to read, because of a temporary difficulty with auditory processing; in the aftermath of the stroke, Fetterman still doesn’t understand everything that’s said to him. With the captioning, however, he was able to respond to the reporter’s questions (<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-fetterman-stumbles-stutters-during-interview-requires-closed-captioning-after-may-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the occasional verbal slip-up</a>). During the interview, Fetterman said that the stroke has changed his life — but that it wouldn’t affect his ability to serve as an elected official. Still, the interview prompted a new spate of questions <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1579926965716410385?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and digs</a> from Republicans about whether his recovery makes him unfit for a seat in Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-suggest-john-fetterman-sick-serve-neurologists-call/story?id=89590532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lines of attack used against Fetterman</a>, many of which are ableist (meaning they convey prejudice, either overt or subtle, against people with disabilities), tap into long-standing stereotypes about people with disabilities and could affect voters’ perceptions of him. That’s because there continues to be stigma against people with disabilities, according to Lisa Schur, a co-director of the Rutgers Program for Disability Research. As a result, she said, political “candidates with disabilities have to work extra hard to ensure voters that, yes, I’m competent and capable of doing the job.” This stigma can be particularly intense for candidates with mental or cognitive disabilities — or even for candidates where questions are raised about their cognitive function. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, we don’t have enough evidence to say for certain whether candidates with disabilities have a lower chance of winning elections. We <em>do </em>know, however, that people with disabilities are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/31/1020746037/disability-access-representation-ada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatically underrepresented in government</a>. That’s especially true at the federal level where just over 6 percent of elected officials reported having a disability compared with 12 percent at the local level, <a href="https://smlr.rutgers.edu/news-events/news/report-1-10-politicians-has-disability-thats-gap-representation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a study</a> from Schur and her co-director Douglas Kruse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite his health challenges over the past few months, Fetterman’s odds against Oz still look good. Fetterman’s lead in the race <em>is</em> narrowing, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fetterman-oz-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to recent polls</a>, but <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a> still gives the Democrat a more than 7-in-10 chance of beating his Republican opponent. And that’s probably why Oz has ramped up attacks on Fetterman’s health, Kruse suggested. “Oz is …  behind right now and wants to bring up this issue of competence,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fetterman still leading in most polls</a>, it only helps Republicans to amplify ableist stereotypes about chronic illness and the use of accessibility aids to argue that Fetterman is unfit for office. The media’s coverage of Fetterman’s condition is arguably bolstering them, too: The NBC interview <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/fetterman-nbc-interview-stroke-pennsylvania-senate-race-20221012.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused mostly on his health</a> and the reporter who conducted the interview made an offhand comment that Fetterman appeared to struggle to understand small talk beforehand, <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/nbc-reporter-s-comment-about-u-s-senate-candidate-draws-criticism-1.6106910" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which drew criticism</a> from other reporters who had spoken with the candidate and said he did not exhibit issues with comprehension. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, it’s been easy to keep people focused on Fetterman’s health: His ability to speak and understand, rather than his policy positions, were the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3683383-fetterman-discusses-effects-of-stroke-on-daily-life-in-new-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject of</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/12/john-fetterman-stroke-interview-oz-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://freebeacon.com/democrats/stroke-victim-john-fetterman-still-needs-closed-captions-to-understand-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stories</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/edokeefe/status/1580002053723938816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and tweets</a> posted in reaction to the interview. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/john-fetterman-viral-senate-campaign-fivethirtyeight-91184407</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">According to Richard Scotch, a professor of sociology and public policy at the University of Texas at Dallas who researches disability rights and social inequality, some of the stigma surrounding <em>physical</em> disabilities has decreased over time. “They’re not viewed as negatively as they were 60 or even 30 years ago,” he said. That, in part, could be one reason why a spate of public officials with physical disabilities across the political spectrum — including Republicans Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas and Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, and Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois — have run successful campaigns. “There aren’t many critics who would say that their disability hampers their ability to hold public office,” Scotch said. Still, he added, the same isn’t true for all disabilities: “Impairments that affect one’s ability to communicate effectively may be more stigmatizing than those that do not.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having a disability like Fetterman’s, which he and his doctors <a href="https://www.fox43.com/article/news/politics/john-fetterman-health-senate-campaign-trail-pennsylvania/521-4001ec81-7a3a-4866-9eff-04d19bf830db" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe will improve over time</a>, could fall into that category. That’s because having an “invisible” disability versus a “visible” one — having trouble understanding speech, as opposed to using a wheelchair — could get linked in voters’ minds to issues like mental capacity or a cognitive decline, “which are scarier for people to digest,” Schur said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fetterman is not the only politician of late who has had to field questions about his mental abilities. While not physically disabled, older politicians like <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/17/poll-biden-mental-fitness-job-approval-522785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden</a> or Sen. <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/dianne-feinstein-senate-17079487.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dianne Feinstein</a> (the oldest sitting U.S. Senator <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/13/1104843151/senator-dianne-feinstein-cognitive-health-continues-to-raise-concerns-traister" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is reportedly</a> experiencing a decline in her cognitive health) have been repeatedly told that they should step down from or not seek additional terms in public office. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But disability discrimination is not always covered equally: <a href="https://www.history.com/news/5-presidents-who-hid-their-health-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several former presidents</a>, for instance, have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/17/ronald-reagan-alzheimers-president-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in apparent cognitive decline</a> while in office without much question. What might make Fetterman’s case different, however, is that he’s both publicly discussing his condition (unlike other politicians who have hid theirs) and is in an ongoing and competitive race. “There’s this image in America, especially, that the goal is to be completely independent and self-sufficient: All those values that supposedly go along with this kind of ‘capability,’” Schur told me. “Whenever you see somebody dependent on technology, or accommodations, I think some people, especially those with more traditional values, might question whether that person is fit for a particular job.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Oz’s attacks have drawn on these stereotypes: Last month, the Republican <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/election-2022/oz-releases-medical-records-as-health-becomes-focus-of-u-s-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released his medical records</a> and has been repeatedly challenging Fetterman to do the same, despite the fact that doing so <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-a-historically-old-presidential-field-candidates-refuse-to-release-health-records/2020/02/23/a39045f8-5407-11ea-9e47-59804be1dcfb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a fading tradition</a> — and typically employed in presidential races, not Senate races. “If John Fetterman had ever eaten a vegetable in his life, then maybe he wouldn’t have had a major stroke and wouldn’t be in the position of having to lie about it constantly,” a senior communications adviser to Oz’s campaign <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oz-on-fetterman-if-hed-eaten-vegetable-wouldnt-have-stroke-2022-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, Fetterman’s health journey could resonate with some people. According to estimates from Kruse and Schur, 69 million people in the 2020 electorate either had a disability themselves or lived with someone with a disability. “So almost one-third of people have very direct experience with disability,” Kruse said. “And when a politician says they have a disability, I think a lot of people with disabilities and those who are close to them will say, you know, that’s me. That’s part of my identity.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In his interview this week, Fetterman said that his experience gave him an even greater ability to understand the challenges that voters face. “In some ways, having an impairment has some positive valence for candidates because recovering from a serious illness demonstrates grit and resilience,” Scotch said.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, we don’t know enough to say for certain whether Fetterman’s interview and the ongoing recovery from his stroke will change the way he’s perceived. It’s very possible that it won’t, Kruse predicted, since the Democrat utilized widely available closed-captioning technology he said most voters could see as “reasonable.” And despite the fact that our metrics show a tightening race in Pennsylvania, that could be due to a number of factors, including both campaigns ratcheting up attack ads on a host of issues as Election Day approaches or Republican voters coalescing behind Oz. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, though, voters still overwhelmingly have a positive view of Fetterman, according to recent polls. A <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-2022-elections-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September Marist Poll</a> of registered voters in Pennsylvania, for instance, found that a plurality of adults in the state (45 percent) said they had a favorable view of Fetterman compared with 39 percent who had an unfavorable view. Oz, meanwhile, was underwater: Just 30 percent of respondents said they had a favorable view of the former TV personality versus 51 percent who viewed him unfavorably. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, we would expect that this issue will come up again — especially as the race could well determine which party controls the Senate. Fetterman and Oz are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/14/fetterman-campaign-agrees-to-debate-oz-00056741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to debate on Oct. 25</a>, so there’s time for Oz’s attacks to sink in — but also time for Fetterman to respond.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats may currently control the Senate, but many within the party believe 52 Democratic senators are necessary for a true governing majority. That’s because moderate Democratic Sens. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Manchin</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kyrsten-sinema-is-confounding-her-own-party-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyrsten Sinema</a> are reluctant to change the Senate rules and abolish or circumvent the filibuster, which requires a 60-vote supermajority to vote on most legislation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, suppose the party wins 52 seats this November and at least 50 senators vote to suspend the filibuster in the following Congress. The Senate could then pass stalled Democratic priorities like <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/11/senate-democrats-codify-roe-v-wade-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codifying abortion rights into federal law</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/voting-rights-brawl-takes-center-stage-us-senate-2022-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding voting rights</a>. As a result, that’s where Democrats are setting the bar this election cycle: Even President Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/09/23/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-democratic-national-committee-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly asked voters</a> to “give me two more Democratic senators.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, while Democrats have a 66-in-100 chance of holding onto control of the Senate (according to the Deluxe version of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>),<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All numbers in this article are as of Wednesday at 3 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> their odds of winning 52 seats are dicier. In the two most likely scenarios, the party would win either 50 or 51 seats (there’s a 32-in-100 chance of that happening).</p>

According to our forecast, there’s a 34-in-100 chance that Democrats will win 52 or more Senate seats this November. In other words, it’s roughly equally as likely that Republicans will win the Senate, that Democrats will win the Senate with 50 or 51 seats and that Democrats will win the Senate with at least 52 seats.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="840" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-desktop.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-desktop.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-desktop.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-desktop.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="954" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-mobile.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-mobile.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, just electing “two more Democratic senators” wouldn’t be enough to enact the full Democratic agenda. Those two extra senators would have to actually support it. Luckily for the party, that would probably be the case. The most likely candidate to gain a Senate seat for the Democrats looks like Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71-in-100 chance of winning</a>. And he has been outspoken about his desire to eliminate the filibuster so Democrats can “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/10/politics/john-fetterman-filibuster-senate-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get shit done</a>” — such as <a href="https://twitter.com/johnfetterman/status/1480928903762006017?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protecting voting rights</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/johnfetterman/status/1517305371400056832?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passing stricter gun-control measures</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/john-fetterman-viral-senate-campaign-fivethirtyeight-91184407</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Wisconsin, North Carolina and Ohio are the next-likeliest Senate seats to flip from red to blue. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes has a 30-in-100 chance of winning in November. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley has a 29-in-100 chance of winning her race. And in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a>, Rep. Tim Ryan has a 29-in-100 chance of winning the general election. All three have called for eliminating the filibuster. <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/12/09/mandela-barnes-senate-bid-calls-ending-filibuster/6439461001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barnes</a> and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/18/cheri-beasley/beasley-says-shes-been-very-clear-about-filibuster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beasley</a> have explicitly said they wanted to do so to advance voting-rights legislation, while <a href="https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1541168088539971585" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cheribeasleync/status/1561764535488303104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beasley</a> have specifically cited abortion rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But liberal Democrats have one more roadblock. Abolishing the filibuster to pass these bills in the Senate would be pointless if Democrats can’t also get those bills through the House. And that’s their real challenge. They have just a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29-in-100 chance</a> of maintaining control of the lower chamber, a bit lower than their chances of winning at least 52 Senate seats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in our forecast, not every scenario in which Democrats hold the House is one in which they also win 52 or more Senate seats. Our Senate and House forecasts are powered by the same model, which means we can calculate the likelihood of Democrats’ ideal scenarios coming true in both chambers simultaneously. The result: There is a 22-in-100 chance that Democrats will win a majority of House seats <em>and</em> at least 52 Senate seats.</p>

So it’s remarkable that they have a shot at ending 2022 in a <em>better</em> governing position than they are currently in. But it’s still not <em>likely</em> to happen; Republicans would have to underperform expectations significantly. The probability is roughly the same as flipping a coin twice and getting heads both times — it wouldn’t be shocking, but you shouldn’t count on it either.</p>

						Unlike other Democratic candidates for governor this year, Kansas incumbent Laura Kelly isn’t focusing on abortion in her campaign. Rather, it’s her Republican opponent, Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who is pressing the issue.													<p>EVERT NELSON / THE TOPEKA CAPITAL – JOURNAL / AP</p>

		</div>





<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a familiar pattern for this year’s midterm elections: One <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/25/abortion-gop-candidates-governors-races-00058713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate for governor</a> is trying to make the other one talk about abortion. But in most states, it’s the Democrat who’s pushing abortion into the conversation. In Kansas, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-abortion-presidential-legislature-cd8d1d6f24da4612b7faeb325a4611bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s the Republican</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just two months after Kansas voters <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/05/1115808472/kansas-abortion-ballot-measure-campaign-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphatically rejected a ballot initiative</a> that would have removed abortion rights from the state constitution, Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, is mostly skirting the issue. At <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/kansas-governor-debate-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent debate</a>, her Republican opponent, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, needled Kelly about her support for abortion rights, saying that Kelly didn’t support <em>any</em> limits on when abortion should be legal. Kelly responded with the equivalent of a shrug. “I really for 18 years have had the same position on this issue,” she said. “So I really don’t have much more to say.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelly’s silence on abortion shows that not all Democrats are convinced the issue can be deployed to their advantage, particularly in red-leaning states like Kansas. Instead, she’s been focusing on <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/05/kansas-governor-election-debate-laura-kelly-derek-schmidt-marijuana-crime/69529714007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy and education</a>, and <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/09/26/kansas-ads-in-governors-race-often-misleading-disparaging-with-a-partisan-dash-of-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tying Schmidt</a> to the unpopular former governor Sam Brownback. None of the <a href="https://www.washburn.edu/reference/cks/politics/ads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads run by Kelly’s campaign</a> have even mentioned the word “abortion.” And so far, it doesn’t look like a bad approach. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a>,<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> Kelly is slightly favored, with a 66-in-100 chance of winning the election in November, even though she’s <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/this-years-most-vulnerable-incumbent-governors-are-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors</a> this cycle. And while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the polls we do have so far</a> show a tight race, <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/kansas-2022-democratic-governor-laura-kelly-in-tight-race-with-a-g-derek-schmidt-in-gubernatorial-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a September poll from Emerson College/The Hill</a> found that 53 percent of likely voters in Kansas have a favorable view of Kelly, while 45 percent view Schmidt favorably.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few reasons why it might be a smart strategy for a Democrat like Kelly to avoid a focus on abortion rights, even after the ballot initiative’s resounding defeat in August. For one thing, while other Democratic governors, like Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/04/politics/gretchen-whitmer-tudor-dixon-abortion-michigan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built a brand</a> around support for abortion rights, Kelly is different. “It’s not an issue she’s ever really focused on,” said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University-Camden and the director of the Center on American Women in Politics. Back in 2018, when Kelly was running against Republican Kris Kobach, she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-kris-kobachs-defeat-in-kansas-a-model-for-how-to-beat-trumpism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homed in on the same “kitchen-table issues”</a> she’s highlighting this time, similarly breaking with a larger national trend by refusing to engage with her opponent’s Trumpian rhetoric on immigration and voter fraud.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the time, that decision to stray from the national trend seemed to be a canny assessment of Kansas’s state politics. In races at the state or local level, voters may be less influenced by national issues and their own partisan identity. This is partially how Kelly was able to defeat Kobach by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/kansas-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a solid 5-percentage-point margin</a> in 2018, even though Trump won the state by double-digit margins in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/kansas-president-clinton-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-kansas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a>. Over the past decade or so, Republican presidential candidates have consistently won Kansas by double digits, but in 2014 and 2018, the gubernatorial margins were narrower.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This year, Kelly appears to be betting once again that what works for Democrats nationally won’t work for her in Kansas. After all, the fact that Kansans voted down an anti-abortion ballot amendment was never going to automatically translate into support for Democratic candidates. According to <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;home_state=Kansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling by Civiqs</a>, Kansans are only slightly more likely to think abortion should be legal in all or most cases (49 percent) than to think it should be illegal in all or most cases (47 percent). And the anti-amendment campaign’s advertising didn’t focus on abortion rights in redder, more rural parts of the state — instead, its ads <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/why-kansas-abortion-amendment-failed-even-in-rural-counties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrayed the amendment</a> as a government intrusion into Kansans’ freedom and bodily autonomy, similar to a mask mandate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because the Kansas amendment was the first opportunity for voters to weigh in on the issue in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning abortion rights, the anti-amendment campaign also benefited from a lot of national attention — and national money. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the course of 2022, the anti-amendment campaign pulled in more than $10.5 million<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total contributions include itemized and unitemized (including those under $50) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> in financial contributions, including some major out-of-state cash. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of campaign-finance filings from the two major groups on either side of the amendment, the vast majority (84 percent) of the anti-amendment donations of $50 or more<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the organization against the amendment, did not itemize donations under $50, which totaled $125,712, so we were unable to analyze where they came from. We calculated percentages based on dollar amounts, not the number of contributors, because contributors could donate more than once. A total of $52,970 came from donors who did not provide their addresses, so this was excluded from the analysis of contributions by state. In-kind contributions were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> came from donors with addresses outside Kansas, including one contribution of nearly $1.3 million from former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and another contribution of nearly $1.5 million from Sixteen Thirty Fund, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/17/dark-money-sixteen-thirty-fund-522781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left-leaning “dark money” group</a>. By contrast, nearly $1.7 million came from donors with addresses inside Kansas.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The pro-amendment campaign, meanwhile, raised less money — nearly $6.7 million<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total contributions include donations under $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> in financial contributions, according to its last report — but almost all of it (99 percent) came from donors with addresses in Kansas.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a direct comparison with donations to Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, we excluded donations to Value Them Both, the main organization supporting the amendment, under $50, which totaled $54,114 plus an additional $120 in unitemized contributions (denoted as “$50 or less”). A total of $17,495 in contributions came from donors who did not provide their addresses, so this was excluded from the analysis of contributions by state. In-kind contributions were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> That included some large donations, too, such as one contribution of nearly $1.3 million from the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archdiocese made multiple contributions of at least $350,000, excluding in-kind contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> and one contribution of $300,000 from the Catholic Diocese of Wichita,<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diocese made multiple contributions ranging from hundreds of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> so it’s hard to say whether one side had more grassroots support in Kansas than the other. What is clear from this data, however, is that the anti-amendment campaign’s large cash advantage was fueled mainly by out-of-state donors, not by a surge in financial support from within Kansas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s other evidence, too, that abortion rights simply aren’t a big priority for Kansas voters in the upcoming midterm elections. According to that Emerson College poll, 48 percent of likely voters say the economy is the most important issue in the election, followed by a much smaller share (16 percent) who say abortion is the most important. The poll also found that only 72 percent of Kansans who voted “no” on the amendment (i.e., those in favor of preserving abortion rights in the state constitution) are planning to vote for Kelly, showing that support for a Democratic governor and opposition to the amendment aren’t linked for some voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it makes some sense for Kelly to break with the nationwide trend and steer clear of the issue of abortion rights. Whether it’s a good idea for Schmidt to bring up the issue, however, is a different question. The Emerson College poll found that Kansas voters are actually more likely to say they align most with Kelly on abortion rights (48 percent) than with Schmidt (44 percent). It’s possible, therefore, that Schmidt might benefit from taking a page out of Kelly’s playbook and focus on matters like the economy instead of attacking her on an issue that isn’t a high priority for voters — <em>and</em> that he doesn’t have the advantage on.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This November, Vermont voters <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look very likely</a> to reelect Republican Gov. Phil Scott <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and to send</a> Democratic Rep. Peter Welch to the U.S. Senate. Considering the candidates, the partisan disconnect between these two major statewide races might not seem shocking. After all, Scott ranks as <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/11/whitmers-approval-ticks-up-in-michigan-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the nation’s most popular governors</a> and Welch has served as Vermont’s lone House member for eight terms, <a href="https://electionarchive.vermont.gov/elections/search/year_from:2006/year_to:2020/office_id:5/stage:General" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easily winning reelection over and over again</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the larger context of the 2022 midterm elections and national political trends, Vermont couldn’t be stranger. That’s because the voting margins in the Senate and governor races of most other states won’t differ that much, thanks to a decreasing tendency for voters to back one party’s candidate in one race and the other party’s candidate in another — an electoral phenomenon known as casting a <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/split-ticket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split-ticket</a> vote. While there will still be at least minor differences in these races, nowadays most voters <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to fall in line</a> behind either the Democratic or Republican candidates, making it more likely that a state’s election results for Senate and governor will look pretty similar.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This November, 26 states have both a Senate and a governor’s race, and using the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight midterm forecast’s</a> average margin from each contest, we can project just how close the races in 24 of those states will run together.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of a special election, Oklahoma has two Senate races with its single gubernatorial election, so we actually have 25 cases as we compare Oklahoma’s governor’s race to each Senate contest. We excluded Oregon and Alaska from this analysis because Oregon independent Betsy Johnson &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;looks likely to win&lt;/a&gt; more than 10 percent of the vote in the state’s &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;governor’s race&lt;/a&gt;, which complicates comparing the forecast margin to Oregon’s &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Senate contest&lt;/a&gt;; and because multiple candidates from the same party are running in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alaska’s Senate race&lt;/a&gt; and a high-profile independent, former Gov. Bill Walker, is also running in the state’s gubernatorial contest. Projected margins are from our Deluxe forecast as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern on Oct. 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>27</sup></a> In Vermont, we estimate Welch should win by roughly 23 percentage points over his Republican opponent, while we expect Scott to defeat his Democratic opponent by about 24 points, putting those races a whopping 47 points apart. But Vermont is tracking to be an outlier: Our forecast’s median difference between the margins in a state’s Senate and governor races is only a bit more than 6 points (Pennsylvania), as the table below shows.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the median rather than the average across these states and races because we don’t have a large sample size, which makes outlier results like Vermont’s more likely to skew an average and potentially understate the amount of straight-ticket voting going on these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> That median difference would be the lowest in a midterm election in over three decades, indicative of how split-ticket voting has declined as a result of the increased polarization and nationalization of American politics.</p>

Chris Sununu while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also probably reelecting</a> Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. In Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is locked in a tight reelection battle</a> in what is otherwise a red state, but Republican Sen. Jerry Moran <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should handily win reelection</a>. (These states are notable in that the incumbents are of different parties — more on that later.) But we expect to see a single-digit difference between the Senate and governor races in most states. In some cases, that might even mean nearly zero variation, as our projected vote margin for Nevada shows both Democratic incumbents running in essentially dead heats. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, should the 2022 results in these states mirror our projected vote margins — and they largely did in 2018 — this midterm will likely feature the smallest median gap between concurrent Senate and gubernatorial races in midterms dating back to 1990.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at midterm elections not only because 2022 is a midterm, but because 36 of the 50 states elect governors in midterms, so midterms are where the concurrent Senate-governor elections mostly occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> The 2022 estimated median would be even lower than the 2018 median, which had already set a modern record with a median difference of about 10 points. The overall decline in split-ticket voting isn’t limited to only Senate and governor races, either: In 2020, most Senate and House races <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t differ markedly</a> from the presidential vote in their state or district. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://youtu.be/uPnfuczOWb8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We’re not in 1990 anymore</a>, Toto, thanks to forces driving voters to more uniformly back a single party. The Democratic and Republican parties <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have grown farther apart ideologically</a>, and voters <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/the-partisan-landscape-and-views-of-the-parties/#fn-20071486-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are increasingly likely to say</a> that there are sizable differences between the parties. At the same time, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/interactives/political-polarization-1994-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters’ political views have also become more polarized</a>, with more Democrats becoming consistently liberal and more Republicans becoming more consistently conservative. And because of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative partisanship</a>, voters are now more inclined to dislike the other party out of hand, making them less likely to consider voting for a candidate from the opposite party under any condition. These developments have left the country with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/just-how-many-swing-voters-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer swing voters than ever</a>; despite the large number of Americans who claim to be independent, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-americans-who-identify-as-independent-are-actually-independent-thats-really-bad-for-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most in fact prefer one side</a>. More broadly, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics are more nationalized</a>, which has reduced regional variation in elections for Senate or governor, making it less likely that ruby-red Alabama will elect a Democratic governor (<a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1998&amp;fips=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last happened in 1998</a>) or that deep-blue New York will elect a Republican senator (<a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=36&amp;year=1992&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;class=3&amp;elect=0&amp;minper=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last happened in 1992</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other factors such as incumbency also play into the differences between Senate and gubernatorial margins. While incumbency <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912919883696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not as powerful a boost</a> as it once was, we still expect incumbents to perform better than non-incumbents. In races where different parties have incumbents defending the Senate and governor seats, you’ll tend to see a larger gap, like in Georgia, Kansas or New Hampshire, as the appeal of each incumbent will encourage voters to split their tickets. You’ll also see some sizable differences in states where one race doesn’t have an incumbent, such as Ohio and Vermont, as the absence of the incumbency advantage in one race can mean the national environment and partisan baseline of the state will exert a stronger influence on its result. By contrast, in states with incumbents from the same party in both races, you’ll generally see smaller differences between the two.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Important state-to-state differences can come into play here, too. A decade ago, FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/swing-voters-and-elastic-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced the concept</a> of “elastic” and “inelastic” states, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refers to how sensitive a state is</a> to changes in the national political environment and the relative swinginess of the state. We’d expect a more elastic state to have more variation in its voting preferences from year to year, and more variation from race to race in the same year. In the table below, we lay out FiveThirtyEight’s elasticity scores by state, which are used in our forecast. Tellingly, New Hampshire and Vermont are right near the top of the list.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Together, these national, state and candidate forces can influence how many voters split tickets for Senate and governor. Despite the recent decline in split-ticket voting, however, the small share of voters who do split their votes remains critically important. Take Georgia, a pretty inelastic state that currently projects to have about an 8-point difference between its Senate and gubernatorial races, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would rank as one of the state’s largest gaps</a> in recent memory. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who leads in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average</a> by roughly 6 points, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks more certain</a> to win <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock</a>, who <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads by about 4 points</a>. But <em>if</em> that gap largely holds, it probably makes a Warnock victory more likely because it suggests at least a few Georgia voters plan to split their votes between Warnock and Kemp. If the gap narrows, however, the races are more likely to run closely together, which could help Republicans win both races in what remains a somewhat GOP-leaning state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we get closer to Election Day, many factors will affect how these races play out, and even if the number of split-ticket voters is smaller, they can still shape who wins the Senate and gubernatorial contests in these states. So watch how big or small these gaps prove to be on Election Day, as they’ll tell us more about just how willing voters are to back different parties for major offices, a sign of just how partisan things could become.</p>]]></description>
