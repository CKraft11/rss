<p data-paragraph="main">Is Michigan a red state or a blue state?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s a purple state,” you might say! But sorry, I’m not going to let you off so easily. You have to pick the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red pill or the blue pill</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a Michigan native, I’d say Michigan is a blue state. Not that this assessment requires any particular local knowledge. It has voted Democratic for president all but once since 1992 (it voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016). Its governorship has bounced back and forth more, but its current governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a Democrat and a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clear favorite for reelection</a>, according to the FiveThirtyEight 2022 midterm election forecast. Democrats have also controlled both of its U.S. Senate seats since the 2000 elections. The state legislature is Republican-controlled, but Democrats should be <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-redistricting-drafts-could-make-state-senate-toss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive this year</a> after redistricting. So it’s a close call, but I’m going with Michigan as a “blue state.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean index, Michigan is <em>Republican</em>-leaning. Specifically, it’s 1.2 percentage points more Republican than the country overall.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> It’s close, but Michigan’s partisan lean nods toward “red state.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, who’s right in this case? Me or the algorithm?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Well, I’m a wee bit biased here, but I think I’m right. Michigan is more a blue state than a red state, and the distinction reveals something important about the balance of power in politics today and the strategies of the major political parties.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean index classifies Michigan as Republican-leaning because it has been less blue than the country as a whole in recent elections. Case in point: In 2020, now-President Joe Biden won Michigan by 2.8 points, less than his 4.5-point margin in the national popular vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, the national popular vote might not be the best baseline. After all, it depends in part on states where Democrats win by huge margins, without getting any additional benefit in the Electoral College. For instance, Biden won California by more than 5 million votes. But suppose he’d won it by <em>only</em> 1 million votes. It would still be a comfortable margin, but in that case, Biden would have won the national popular vote by only 1.9 points, and Michigan would have been to the left of the country as a whole, without changing the Electoral College outcome at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is somewhat complex, so let me state my hypothesis as clearly as possible — there are two of them, really:</p>



<ol><li>Parties are trying to win control of the presidency and Congress. But since the popular vote doesn’t determine control of these, parties don’t actually care about the popular vote. Therefore, measures like FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean index that are calibrated based on the popular vote may be flawed.</li><li>Republicans currently have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/">a structural advantage in many of America’s political institutions</a>. However, it doesn’t necessarily follow that Republicans will win more than half the time.</li></ol><p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with that second point. One important but easy-to-overlook facet of American elections is that each party wins about half the time. Over the past 40 years, for example, Democrats have controlled the presidency for 18 years (two years and counting for Biden, eight each for former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton) while Republicans have had it for 22. Also in the past 40 years, Democrats have held the U.S. Senate for just short of 20 years,<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermont Sen. James Jeffords &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/05/23/way-ahead-of-his-time-jim-jeffords-2001-political-switch-back-in-the-spotlight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;began caucusing with the Democrats&lt;/a&gt; about 6 months into the 107th Congress, giving Democrats majority control. So more precisely, Democrats have controlled the Senate for about 19.5 of the past 40 years, and Republicans 20.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> and Republicans for just slightly more than 20 years. The House? Democrats have been in charge for roughly 20 years and the GOP for 20.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that Republicans currently enjoy a structural advantage <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/wisconsin-was-the-electoral-college-tipping-point-state-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the Electoral College</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the U.S. Senate</a>, such that they can expect to win both with less than half of the popular vote. (They also had an advantage in the U.S. House for most of the 2010s, although that has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been reduced somewhat following redistricting</a>.) But I don’t think it necessarily follows that Republicans can expect to win those offices more than half the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After all, Republicans haven’t done a great job of winning these offices recently. They lost the presidency in 2020. They don’t control the Senate — and they may not get it back this year. The FiveThirtyEight forecast now shows Democrats with a 70 percent chance of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/?cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping control of the Senate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, some votes are more valuable than others. In a presidential election, for instance, the marginal vote in Michigan matters a lot more than the marginal vote in California. And in the Senate, a voter in North Dakota has a lot more power than one in Texas, since Texas has the same number of senators despite having more than 37 times the inhabitants. This creates <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a significant bias in the Senate toward white, rural voters</a>, who are overrepresented in low-population states, and moreover, Republicans in the Trump era have adopted a particularly potent strategy of catering to those voters. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/abortion-stay-legal-pennsylvania-fivethirtyeight-89543566</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Put another way, the upshot of the structural bias toward Republicans may not be that they can attain some permanent supermajority, but rather that they are able to win elections half the time <em>despite</em> advancing policies that are significantly to the right of the <a href="https://www.cantorsparadise.com/the-median-voter-theorem-c81630b57fa4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">median voter</a>, especially on issues like abortion, gun control and environmental regulation. It’s likely not a coincidence either that these issues have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong urban-rural divides</a>, which speak to the GOP’s current advantage in the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet it’s not as though Republicans are in some untenable position. Their structural advantages give them a much bigger margin for error, and so they still have decent chances in the Senate despite nominating a poor slate of candidates. They’re also <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/?cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored to win the House</a> according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast. And they <a href="https://electionbettingodds.com/PresidentialParty2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have plenty of hope of winning the presidency back in 2024</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It may seem strange to talk about the parties in such an abstract manner, as though they’re rational actors pursuing some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game-theory-derived Nash equilibrium</a>. Indeed, this description leaves a lot to be desired. The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are not simple entities. Although there are formal party structures such as the Republican National Committee, in practice, much of a party’s power rests with current, former and aspiring elected officials, along with donors, other public figures who are influential within the party and, of course, the voters. These groups’ objectives don’t always align, and sometimes that can result in outcomes such as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-hard-to-win-a-senate-race-when-youve-never-won-an-election-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominating subpar candidates to key Senate races</a> or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-trumps-presence-in-the-midterms-is-risky-for-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having a former president interfere in a midterm in unhelpful ways</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if neither party is particularly happy with its situation — well, that’s sometimes what an equilibrium looks like, in the same sense that both sides often walk away feeling a little unhappy after a tough negotiation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, this has considerations for our partisan lean index. The implication we frequently take from it — in fact, this is an assumption built into our various forecast models — is over the long run, such as if you play out the next 40 years given current party coalitions, the <em>popular</em> vote for Congress and the presidency will be tied in an average year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I don’t think that’s the correct implication, though. My assertion here, instead, is that each party will continue to win elections about half the time even though Democrats are likely to continue to win the popular vote <em>more</em> than half the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since 2016, for instance, Democrats have won the popular vote for the presidency by 2.1 points (Hillary Clinton) and 4.5 points (Biden). They also won the popular vote for the U.S. House by 3.1 points in 2020 and 8.6 points in 2018, but lost it by 1.1 point in 2016. This is a crude method, but if you average those five figures, you wind up with Democrats winning the popular vote by 3.4 points on average.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here’s what our partisan lean index would look like in a year where Democrats win the national popular vote by 3.4 points. Note that a state like Michigan — along with Nevada and Pennsylvania — now rates as slightly blue rather than slightly red. Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida are still red-leaning, however. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That all seems fairly intuitive relative to how recent elections have gone — more so than the implication that Michigan is a red state.

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court’s conservative justices aren’t on the ballot this November. But for Democratic voters, the upcoming midterms are looking more and more like a referendum on the country’s high court.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In late June, when the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned the constitutional right to abortion</a> in a contentious and divided ruling, Republicans had a solid 2-percentage-point lead over Democrats in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic-ballot polling</a>, which asks Americans whether they plan to support Republicans or Democrats in the upcoming congressional election. A little over two months later, though, and abortion is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly or completely illegal in 14 states</a> — and those generic-ballot polls look very different. According to FiveThirtyEight’s average, Democrats now have more than a 1-point lead over Republicans.</p>



<figure><div>
<img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/generic-ballot-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/generic-ballot-2.png"></div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That’s a remarkable shift in a year when Republicans should have the wind at their back — normally, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president’s party loses seats</a> in the midterm elections. And although things could change in the months leading up to November, there’s mounting evidence that the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-is-becoming-a-winning-issue-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galvanizing Democrats</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shaking up the political landscape</a> in the process. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/abortion-stay-legal-pennsylvania-fivethirtyeight-89543566</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/09/01/positive-views-of-supreme-court-decline-sharply-following-abortion-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center poll</a> conducted Aug. 1-14 found that more Americans have an unfavorable view of the Supreme Court than at any other point since Pew began asking the question just over 35 years ago. Only 28 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have a favorable view of the Supreme Court, down 18 points since January and nearly 40 points since August 2020. Republicans’ views of the court, meanwhile, have gotten a bit more positive since the beginning of the year, which has created a gaping 45-point partisan gap in the Supreme Court’s favorability rating.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Views of the Supreme Court are more polarized than ever" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iO1YP/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just that views of the court are changing — the importance of abortion as an issue priority is also skyrocketing for Democrats in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision. According to the same <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/23/abortion-rises-in-importance-as-a-voting-issue-driven-by-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew survey</a>, the economy remains voters’ top issue overall, but the share of Democrats who say abortion is a very important issue for the midterm elections rose from 46 percent in March to 71 percent in August. Meanwhile, in a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/395408/abortion-moves-important-problem-list.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll</a> conducted July 5-26, 13 percent of Democrats said that abortion issues were the most important problem facing the country — driving record-high levels of concern among Americans overall. An additional 9 percent of Democrats said that the judicial system and the courts were the most important problem. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This heightened focus on abortion and the court seems to be having a real effect on the midterms, too, with Democrats and independents saying in polls that they have a greater desire to vote for candidates who share their views on abortion. According to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-july-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Family Foundation poll</a> conducted July 7-17, for instance, nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of Democratic voters and 56 percent of independent voters say the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs has made them more motivated to consider a candidate’s position on abortion. However, 62 percent of Republicans said the decision hadn’t made a difference to them.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-performing-abortion-ruling-fivethirtyeight-88822518</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Americans can’t vote Supreme Court justices off the bench, of course, but the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/09/01/positive-views-of-supreme-court-decline-sharply-following-abortion-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew survey</a> suggests that Democrats are more and more likely to think the court has too much authority. A solid majority (64 percent) of Democrats say the Supreme Court has too much power, up from only 23 percent in August 2020. Increasingly, Democrats also say that the justices are not making politically neutral decisions. Just over half (51 percent) of Democrats say the justices are doing a poor job of keeping their own politics out of their decision-making, up from 26 percent in January. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even Republicans are somewhat divided on this question: One-third (33 percent) of Republicans said the court was doing an excellent or good job of keeping politics out of their decision-making, while 25 percent said the court was doing a fair job and 12 percent said it was doing a poor job. (An additional 15 percent of Republicans said they weren’t sure, and 13 percent said the Supreme Court justices <em>should</em> bring their own political views into their decision-making.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t the first time that anger surrounding the Supreme Court has reshaped a midterm election. In 2018, the fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-kavanaugh-helping-republicans-midterm-chances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared to help</a> Republican candidates in some key Senate races. At the same time, however, there were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-may-be-mobilizing-more-democratic-voters-than-republicans-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs that year</a> that the changing makeup of the Supreme Court — and the possible impact on abortion rights — was raising the salience of the issue for Democrats. That didn’t seem to pay off for Democrats in the 2018 midterms since <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/01/a-look-at-voters-views-ahead-of-the-2018-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their base</a> was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-republicans-losing-the-health-care-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivated by other issues</a>, but 2022 may be different. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>While the Supreme Court understandably grabs a lot of attention for its decisions, few Americans are familiar with the process of confirming federal judges, according to an Aug. 17-18 survey conducted by <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/9/1/voters-affirm-the-senates-mandate-to-fill-judicial-vacancies">Data for Progress for Demand Justice</a>. As of Thursday, <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/current-judicial-vacancies">82 seats</a> were vacant, and many of them are expected to remain empty at the end of the year. While a majority (71 percent) of all likely voters agreed it’s at least somewhat urgent to fill these positions, only 11 percent said they knew a lot about the confirmation process — a figure which doesn’t vary much by party identification. Just over half (53 percent) of respondents said they supported holding additional Senate hearings to consider more of President Biden’s nominees, though that stance was highly partisan, with 80 percent of Democratic voters in support compared with just 26 percent of Republicans. </li></ul><ul><li>With the new academic year underway, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/08/22/texas-schools-in-god-we-trust-signs/7865872001/">Texas is mandating</a> that public schools display donated signs bearing the national motto, “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/in-god-we-trust-reaffirmed-as-national-motto-again/">In God we trust</a>.” An Aug. 31 <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/31/cbce2/2">poll by YouGov</a> found that a slim majority of Americans would strongly (35 percent) or somewhat (17 percent) support a similar policy in their own state’s schools. That number soared among Republicans (81 percent) but fell among Democrats (40 percent) and independents (46 percent). Regionally, support for such a measure was greatest in the South (55 percent). </li></ul><ul><li>Most Americans (54 percent) have a favorable view of labor unions, per a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/8r3sug5jju/toplines_Labor_and_Unions_20220824.pdf">YouGov survey</a> of adult citizens conducted Aug. 24-28, though only 10 percent reported that they are members themselves. (Another 9 percent say someone else in their household is a union member.) Almost half (47 percent) agreed that striking was an effective method in getting what they wanted from employers, although Democrats (66 percent) were much more likely to hold that view than Republicans (39 percent) or independents (38 percent). </li></ul><ul><li>Even though social media influencers seem to be <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/04/30/influencer-culture-is-everywhere-even-in-academia/">monopolizing apps</a> like TikTok and Instagram, an Aug. 25-Sept. 1 <a href="https://civicscience.com/despite-low-levels-of-trust-influencer-marketing-continues-to-drive-purchases/">CivicScience study</a> revealed that only 3 percent of Americans trust influencers. That number ticks up slightly among adults under 25 (9 percent) and those between 25 and 34 (8 percent), although a sizable share of both groups (37 percent and 46 percent, respectively) report feeling distrustful of them. That said, influencers are, well, influencing spending habits somewhat among those age groups: 30 percent of adults under 25 and 21 percent of those 25 to 34 said they had purchased a product or service in the past six months after seeing it promoted by an influencer or blogger online. Only 6 percent of 35- to 54-year-olds and 3 percent of adults 55 and up said the same.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): Something we’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written about</a> pretty extensively <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at FiveThirtyEight</a> is the fact that Democrats are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the upswing</a>. Whether it’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special elections</a> or <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the generic ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they’d support in an election, Democrats’ standing has steadily improved since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson, in June. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is especially true in the Senate, where Democrats currently have a 70 percent chance of winning in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2022 FiveThirtyEight midterm election forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="808" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-change-711-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-change-711-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-change-711-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-change-711-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Are Republicans in trouble in the Senate?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It certainly seems Minority Leader Mitch McConnell thinks that’s the case. In August, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/mcconnell-says-republicans-may-not-win-senate-control-citing-candidate-rcna43777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he said at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Kentucky that</a> “I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s talk Senate races and the GOP’s best pickup chances, along with the races where they might be surprisingly weak (and yes, those often might be the same races). Let’s start with the four most competitive Senate seats that are the GOP’s best pickup opportunities this year — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire</a> — as well as two other Senate seats they need to hold onto — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a>, which is an open seat, and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, where Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is seeking reelection, although that seat is currently rated as a toss-up in our forecast.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First up, what’s going on with Wisconsin? Could Republicans lose it?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): Yes, Republicans could absolutely lose Wisconsin. According to the Deluxe version of the FiveThirtyEight forecast, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the race is a toss-up</a>: Johnson has a 51-in-100 chance of winning, and Democrat Mandela Barnes has a 49-in-100 chance of winning.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="848" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-WI-S3-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-WI-S3-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-WI-S3-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-WI-S3-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And if you use the Lite version of our forecast — which mostly uses just polls, no “fundamentals” or expert race ratings — Barnes is leading, with a 72-in-100 chance of winning.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The big question is whether those polls, which have generally shown Barnes ahead, get better for Republicans. We’ve seen only <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few polls out of Wisconsin</a> so far this year, so the picture there is fuzzier than in other states. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> So few polls that we don’t even have a polling average yet! (For curious readers, our criteria is: at least five polls from three different pollsters conducted this year.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words … #trustthepolls but with a healthy dose of skepticism when it comes to Wisconsin?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes, polls in Wisconsin were notoriously bad in 2020. Our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2020/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final polling average</a> had Biden leading by 8.4 percentage points in Wisconsin, and he ended up winning by less than 1 point. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): From what polling I’ve seen, Johnson’s approval numbers leave a lot to be desired. A June <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MLSP70Toplines.html#Q3:_Biden%E2%80%99s_overall_job" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marquette University Law School</a> had his favorability at just 37 percent among registered voters, with 46 percent saying they viewed the two-term senator unfavorably. That same poll also showed a tight race between Johnson and Barnes, with the latter narrowly ahead, 46 percent to 44 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But I definitely don’t think we should count Johnson out. The national climate is still probably on his side, for one, and he’s defeated formidable opponents before. (Back in 2016, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/wisconsin-senate-johnson-feingold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he narrowly bested</a> three-term Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I don’t know, Alex. I think Johnson is a pretty weak candidate. He has made some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/03/ron-johnson-takes-his-anti-vaccine-rhetoric-weird-new-place/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conspiratorial comments about vaccines</a>, and he was allegedly involved in the effort to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/21/jan-6-panel-trump-overturn-2020-election-00040816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">throw the 2020 election to Trump</a>. He did win in 2016, but I think he just got lucky — Wisconsin banked hard to the right that year, as Hillary Clinton can attest. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst): Well, I’m not so sure, Nathaniel. Johnson is a Republican incumbent in a state that has a small lean toward the GOP, in a midterm in which Democrats hold the White House. Those sorts of conditions don’t usually work out for the challenging party. In fact, earlier this year, for CNN, former FiveThirtyEighter Harry Enten <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/ron-johnson-republicans-senate-2022-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked at midterms dating back to 1982</a> and found that incumbent senators in circumstances like Johnson’s have won 86 of 87 times since then.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> What could also work in Johnson’s favor is that Republicans are looking to paint Barnes <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/30/wisconsin-barnes-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as too liberal</a> and out of touch with the state’s politics. In August, I wrote about why Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-ilhan-omar-almost-lost-her-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sort of bogey(wo)man for Republicans</a>, so if the GOP can successfully tie her brand of firebrand progressivism to Barnes, then he could be in real trouble considering what Nathaniel said earlier about Wisconsin only narrowly going for Biden in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Indeed, Alex! In fact, FiveThirtyEight’s video team did a whole video on Barnes and how he’s trying to cast himself as more of a moderate to voters.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But let’s talk over the other seat that Republicans technically control — Pennsylvania — although it’s an open-seat race, with Sen. Pat Toomey retiring. How do things look for Republicans there?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Pennsylvania is problematic for the GOP, as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast</a> currently gives Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman about a 4-in-5 shot of winning over Republican Mehmet Oz.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="848" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Toomey’s retirement produced a highly competitive Republican primary, which Oz <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dr-oz-wins-pennsylvania-senate-primary-951-votes-final-tally-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely won</a>, and Fetterman now holds an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8-point lead in the polls</a>. But like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania has a slight Republican lean, so this really should be ground the GOP is better positioned to hold. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Pennsylvania is another state, though, where <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2020/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the polls weren’t exactly on target</a> in 2020. Although as we’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written extensively at FiveThirtyEight</a>, just because the polls miss in one election, doesn’t mean they’ll miss in the following election — or even in the same direction!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> This race has been a big surprise for me. I’d have thought that Oz’s more liberal past positions on issues like <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-conservative-policy-pa-senate-race-20220419.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion and gun control</a> would be helping him in a general election. Instead, he’s had trouble improving his image after a really nasty Republican primary. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Oz also isn’t very well-liked in the state. A <a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/politics/2022/aarp-pennsylvania-2022-elections-voter-survey.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00550.003.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> by AARP/Fabrizio Ward/Impact Research in June, for instance, found that his favorability rating among likely voters in Pennsylvania was 33 points underwater — 30 percent favorable to 63 percent unfavorable. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fetterman, on the other hand, had a net-positive favorability rating of 10 points: 46 percent to 36 percent. And the survey was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken prior</a> to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, so I’m wondering if some Republicans — and women, who were also not particularly keen on Oz, per the survey — have since soured on Oz even more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> I am curious, though, how big of a problem Fetterman’s health is going to be for him in the general election. (He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/15/us/politics/john-fetterman-stroke.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a stroke</a> in May.) The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s editorial board wrote on Monday that if <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2022/09/06/mehmet-oz-stroke-auditory-processing-debate-john-fetterman-election-senate-pennsylvania-health/stories/202209020009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fetterman isn’t able to debate Oz</a>, it should raise serious questions about whether he’s up for the task of being a U.S. senator. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a challenging situation to discuss sensitively, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/08/31/john-fetterman-dr-mehmet-oz-debates-stroke-health-concessions/stories/202208310107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oz’s campaign</a> definitely hasn’t always done that, but Fetterman’s health could be a real liability for him this fall. Fetterman, for the record, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/07/fetterman-to-politico-i-will-debate-oz-00055301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Politico on Wednesday</a> that he plans to debate Oz.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah, no one should be writing off Oz. Besides the fact that Pennsylvania has a slight Republican lean, it’s possible Oz could better consolidate support among Republicans and move into a more competitive position in the coming weeks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two recent polls from <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/pennsylvania-2022-fetterman-holds-four-point-lead-over-oz-for-us-senate-shapiro-leads-mastriano-by-three/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College</a> and <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2022/Topline-PAStatewide-Aug2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susquehanna Polling and Research</a> found that Republican voters were likelier to be undecided than Democrats, so if those voters come home to Oz, the race could get <em>a lot</em> tighter. Both of those polls also found a closer race than our polling average, instead finding Fetterman with a 4- to 5-point edge. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> But OK. The two Senate races we’ve talked about so far are in states where Republicans currently have control. Let’s talk about some of their best pickup opportunities, starting with Georgia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I know <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/georgia-2022-walker-holds-two-point-lead-over-warnock-in-tight-senate-race-kemp-leads-abrams-by-four/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some recent polls</a> have given Republican Herschel Walker a slight edge over Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, but I think it’ll be hard to take down the incumbent. For one, Walker has been dogged with not-so-great headlines that suggest <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-lied-about-his-secret-kids-to-his-own-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he did not disclose</a> all of his children, despite previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/us/politics/herschel-walker-son.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chastising absent Black fathers</a>. He also has <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/investigations/herschel-walkers-business-record-reveals-creditor-lawsuits-exaggerated-claims/D3FRT4RA7NFKTN23423ENPUP7A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exaggerated his business</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/fact-check-walker-university-of-georgia-graduated/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">academic record</a>. Moreover, Warnock has continued to be <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/raphael-warnock-fundraising-second-quarter-georgia-senate-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fundraising behemoth</a>, raising more than $17 million in the second-quarter of the year, compared with Walker’s $6.2 million. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This race is tricky, though, because the national environment will probably be better for the GOP and Walker is <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/georgia-2022-walker-holds-two-point-lead-over-warnock-in-tight-senate-race-kemp-leads-abrams-by-four/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively well liked</a> in the state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> If Republicans want to win the Senate, they basically have to defeat Warnock. Case in point: According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build-your-own version of the FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, if Democrats win Georgia, they have a 91 percent chance of holding the Senate:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1592" height="958" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image00111.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image00111.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image00111.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image00111.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Put another way, according to the Deluxe version of our forecast, Georgia also has a 15 percent chance of being the tipping-point state in the Senate, or the state that decides control of the chamber — which is more than the tipping-point odds of any other state in our forecast.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> There’s a real push and pull here with Georgia, though. The state obviously is more politically competitive now than it’s been in a long time, which is helpful to Warnock. He is also a decently popular senator who could benefit at least a little bit from incumbency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Georgia is also a state with a racially polarized electorate that is, as we say, “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly inelastic</a>” because it just doesn’t have a lot of swing voters. Historically, when major races like Senate and governor are on the ballot at the same time in Georgia, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they usually wind up with pretty similar results</a>. So with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ahead by about 5 points in the polls</a> and Warnock <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading by roughly 2 points</a>, that 7-point gap would be an especially large gap between the two contests if it holds. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that’s a big “if.” I’m inclined to think the races will converge as we get closer to November. And whether Kemp or Warnock loses ground is very important to keep an eye on. As things currently stand, Warnock needs some Kemp voters in order to win reelection, and given how polarized Georgia’s electorate is, I’m not sure there will be a ton of those.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The one thing I think that’s a little challenging with Georgia is how much it’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted toward Democrats</a>. In other words, a lot could come down to turnout, and it looks as if enthusiasm (on both sides of the aisle) <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394628/americans-intensity-running-high-midterms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be high</a> again this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> If Kemp has a strong performance against his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, could he help pull Walker across the finish line, Geoffrey?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Alex, that’s a difficult question to answer. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/07/19/democratic-governors-are-resisting-bidens-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kemp is pretty popular</a>, so he can definitely help buoy the GOP ticket. Ultimately, I don’t think the Senate and gubernatorial races are going to completely converge, but if it’s a difference of 2 to 3 points by Election Day, that’s probably good news for Walker, whereas if it’s like 5 points or more, that’s good news for Warnock. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> It’s also possible that we get another runoff! Another candidate on the ballot — Libertarian Chase Oliver — could <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/chase-oliver-could-send-georgias-senate-race-to-a-runoff-hes-ok-with-that/GGBXCZ4FZJDYLIWFKDVU6OX2VA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">siphon off votes</a> from both candidates, and if neither clears 50 percent of the vote in November, the top two vote-getters will go head-to-head on Dec. 6. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah, the Senate race looks to have about a 1-in-5 shot of going to a runoff. The forecast gives a slight edge to Walker in a runoff, but we obviously saw Democrats win both Senate runoffs in January 2021 by running ahead of where they were in the November vote, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was at odds with most of Georgia’s recent electoral history</a>, so it would be far from a sure thing for the GOP. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Let’s talk about Nevada, the other Senate race Republicans are heavily targeting as a pickup opportunity. Is Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, like Warnock, perhaps in trouble?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> There are plenty of reasons to believe this race might not be as safe for Democrats as some polls suggest. For one, as we’ve reported before, Nevada is a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-nevada-polls-are-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty transient state</a>, and according to The New York Times, the state’s share of registered Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/us/politics/nevada-midterms-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has dropped</a>. Moreover, Biden won Nevada by only <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little over 2 points</a> in 2020, so it’s very possible that Republicans do better here in a favorable midterm year. The COVID-19 pandemic — and the business shutdowns that came with it — <a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/new-report-reveals-how-hard-pandemic-hit-las-vegas-tourism-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were also particularly devastating</a> to Nevada’s tourism industry. That, plus low approval ratings for Biden, have definitely put Cortez Masto on the defensive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, she is actually the second-most vulnerable Democrat after Warnock, per our forecast. She has just a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63-in-100 chance of winning</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="848" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-NV-S3-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-NV-S3-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-NV-S3-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-NV-S3-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> And, as Alex said, Nevada is maybe more challenging for Democrats than they realize, since <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it has been shifting away from Democrats</a> in recent presidential elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/chat.SENATE.0908.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/chat.SENATE.0908.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/chat.SENATE.0908.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/chat.SENATE.0908.png?w=1424 2x"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Nevada definitely has a couple trends potentially working in the GOP’s favor. For instance, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Latino voters shifted to the right</a> in 2020, although it varied from place to place. But still, Nevada <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/NV,US/RHI725221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a sizable Latino population</a>, and moreover, only a <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=s1501&amp;g=0100000US%240400000&amp;tid=ACSST5Y2020.S1501&amp;tp=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small share of Nevada’s white population</a> has a four-year college degree, which is significant considering that we know <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education is a big dividing line</a> among white voters, with non-college-educated whites moving toward Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I’ll be curious to see which way Latino voters in the state swing, though, Geoffrey. What’s working in the GOP’s favor is that Trump gained support among Latino voters, as you said; plus, like the rest of the country, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/03/24/latino-democrats-inflation-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation and concerns about the economy</a> continue to be a top concern among Latino voters. If Republican Adam Laxalt can tap into that disillusionment and discontent, he’ll definitely make the race more competitive. But Cortez Masto, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/nevada-senate-catherine-cortez-masto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Latina</a> to serve in the U.S. Senate, so far has a slight edge with Latino voters in the state, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-losing-support-hispanic-voters-215124538.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to one poll</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> What do we know about Laxalt as a candidate? We talked about this a little with Georgia and Pennsylvania, but part of the problem for Republicans in the Senate this cycle seems to be an issue of candidate quality. Does Laxalt fit into this mold?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Not really, Sarah. He has some extreme views, like believing the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen from Trump</a>. But unlike Walker and Oz, he has experience as an elected official — he won the Nevada attorney general’s office in 2014.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah, Laxalt is probably one of the least problematic candidates the GOP has nominated. He has an electoral track record, as Nathaniel mentioned, for one thing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I’m curious how much the Dobbs decision will play a role in whether Cortez Masto ultimately prevails. She’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nevada-senate-race-emerges-as-test-of-abortion-issue-after-roe-v-wade-overturned-11661004000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly telling voters</a> that a GOP-led Senate could lead to a national law banning abortions, and polls suggest that Nevadans also favor abortion rights at higher rates than the national average. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Per a July <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-abortion-trails-only-the-economy-as-a-motivating-issue-for-nevada-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from The Nevada Independent/OH Predictive Insights</a>, roughly 90 percent of the state’s registered voters believe abortions should be legal at least some cases. It also found that abortion rights were the most motivating issue to 17 percent of the state’s voters — second only to the economy, at 40 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> There are two more Senate races we should talk about: Arizona and New Hampshire. They’re also pick-up opportunities for the GOP, although perhaps a little bit more of a stretch for Republicans, at least according to the forecast. Republicans have about <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 1-in-4 shot of winning Arizona</a> and a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1-in-5 shot of winning New Hampshire</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So … uh, what do we make of the Senate race in Arizona?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="848" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-AZ-S3-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-AZ-S3-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-AZ-S3-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-senate-topline-711-AZ-S3-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Blake Masters <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/2022-live-primary-election-race-results/2022/08/03/1115185686/blake-masters-trump-pick-funded-by-billionaire-thiel-wins-arizona-senate-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the GOP primary</a> with Trump’s backing and millions of dollars in support from billionaire tech megadonor Peter Thiel. But Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly has regularly led in the polls, where <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he currently has an 8-point lead</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelly has a combination of things working for him at the moment. First, he’s raised a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0AZ00350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prodigious amount of money</a> that Masters simply cannot match on his own. In fact, this has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/politics/peter-thiel-senate-republicans-blake-masters-jd-vance/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created conflicts within the GOP</a>, as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants Thiel <a href="https://puck.news/can-thiel-and-mcconnell-strike-a-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to keep spending money</a> on Masters’s behalf, but so far, Thiel appears unwilling. Second, Kelly seems to be winning at least a small portion of Republican voters in Arizona, and he leads among independents as well. A <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/AZ-crosstabs_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-August-12-16_released-Aug-18-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News/Beacon Research/Shaw &amp; Co. Research poll</a> from last month found Kelly attracting about 10 percent of GOP voters, which would make him tough to beat if that comes to pass.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> What’s interesting to me about this race is that, on paper, it should be an easy get for Republicans. Kelly won the special election that got him into Congress in 2020 by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-arizona-senate-special.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 points</a>, and Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/arizona-president-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely eked out a win</a> that same year. But I think candidate quality will definitely play a role in this race, and Masters is carrying a lot of baggage. Just to name a few things: He once said that “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-backed-senate-candidate-blake-masters-blames-gun-violence-black-rcna32290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black people, frankly</a>” are to blame for gun violence in the U.S., has promoted <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-senate-candidates-promote-replacement-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the debunked “great replacement” theory</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/us/politics/blake-masters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once argued</a> that Iraq and al-Qaida did not “constitute substantial threats to Americans.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Some of this is stuff Masters said when he was younger, but I suspect part of the issue is that he’s only 36 years old, so these controversial comments are not really that far in the past!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, I feel more confident in the forecast’s prediction of a Kelly win in Arizona than, say, Fetterman in Pennsylvania. Kelly has a king’s ransom in campaign cash (he’s raised more than $54 million), and the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2020/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls in Arizona in 2020</a> were pretty accurate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, that leaves us with one last state to discuss: New Hampshire. The primary there hasn’t yet happened yet, but how are things looking for Republicans?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> New Hampshire is the least competitive of the races we’ve discussed here, and honestly, it’s hard to see it flipping unless Republicans have already flipped places like Georgia and Nevada. Democratic incumbent Maggie Hassan has an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80-in-100 chance of winning</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One complication here is that New Hampshire hasn’t held its primary yet, as you noted, Sarah, and it looks like far-right candidate Don Bolduc could defeat more establishment-flavored state Senate President Chuck Morse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider that the latest poll from the <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1701&amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of New Hampshire</a>, conducted in late August, gave Bolduc 43 percent and Morse 22 percent. Since then, the establishment Republicans have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/31/republican-super-pac-2-million-new-hampshire-senate-primary-00054402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent heavily on Morse’s behalf</a>, so the final result could be tighter. But if Republican primary voters elect Bolduc, Republican party leaders could write off New Hampshire completely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Republicans seem to have struggled to find a likable, well-known candidate who everyone could coalesce around — especially after Gov. Chris Sununu <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/09/sununu-wont-run-for-senate-520413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided against running for U.S. Senate</a> and instead decided to seek reelection. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An August survey by <a href="https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/sacsc-nhsw-0822-book-1660663140.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saint Anselm College Survey Center</a> found that 39 percent of Republican voters were still undecided ahead of next week’s primary. But, similar to Arizona, I think this could be an easier pickup opportunity for Republicans: Per the poll, Hassan has an underwater approval rating in the state — 44 percent who approve versus 51 percent who disapprove, with only 39 percent saying she deserved to be reelected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> We do have some recent evidence, though, that Democrats can win a Senate race in New Hampshire even in a bad midterm. Take Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. She held onto her seat in 2014 despite a red wave.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, phew — we’ve run down six of the big Senate races this year. What are folks’ concluding thoughts on the GOP’s path to winning back the Senate or Democrats’ chances to holding on?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> This should be an easy year for Republicans, but problematic candidates with little to no political experience may well cost the party their chances of winning the chamber back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Completely agreed about the weaker candidates, but I’m also struck by the tough path Republicans have to picking up even <em>one</em> seat. They need to defeat at least one of what looks like a formidable quartet in Warnock, Kelly, Cortez Masto and Hassan, while also not losing any of their own seats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s hard to do, so I think the FiveThirtyEight forecast’s current estimation of a 70 percent chance of a Democratic hold sounds right to me.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Republicans may have an uphill battle to a Senate majority, considering the political environment isn’t proving to be as advantageous for the GOP as we might have expected (at least so far). They’ve also nominated some weaker candidates, as Alex mentioned. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, I think there’s reason to believe some of these races, like Arizona and Pennsylvania, are going to be closer than they currently appear to be. Our forecast definitely keeps that in mind, too. It’s why I’d love to see more polls, especially in Wisconsin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“More polls, please” — the constant FiveThirtyEight refrain.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">After a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-georgia-turned-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history-making 2020</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021</a>, Georgia is once again <a href="https://youtu.be/ggGzE5KfCio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on our minds</a> with two high-profile statewide races on the ballot this November: the U.S. Senate race, a <em>highly</em> competitive contest between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker, as well as the gubernatorial contest, a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-gop-could-make-or-break-its-chances-in-10-key-governors-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-octane rematch</a> between Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But interestingly, these races have pretty different outlooks in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast</a>. The Senate race is currently rated <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a toss-up</a>, while in the governor’s race <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kemp is a clear favorite</a> to win.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Given how partisan our politics have become — especially in a state like Georgia where the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/swing-voters-and-elastic-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electorate is highly polarized</a> — it’s pretty unusual that the two statewide races show such a large gap, as much as 13 percentage points in some polls. Historically, major contests in Georgia have run close together, which is why a sizable split between the Senate and governor’s races would be pretty remarkable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For starters, the gap between the two races varies depending on pollster, but on average, polls have found a 7-point difference between the margins in the Senate and gubernatorial contests. This pretty much matches what our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more rigorous polling averages</a> found, too, with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warnock up around 2 points</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kemp leading by about 5 points</a><a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> — or a 7-point gap.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But the fact that Georgia’s electorate is so polarized makes it unlikely that we’ll see <em>too</em> large of a gap between the two contests. Like most of the Deep South, Georgia <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ssqu.12149" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a racially polarized electorate</a>, where most Black voters back Democrats and most white voters back Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take Georgia’s 2020 presidential vote: 88 percent of Black voters supported President Biden, while 69 percent of white voters supported former President Trump, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Elections/georgia-exit-polls-2020-us-presidential-election-results-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the 2020 exit polls</a>. This gives Georgia what we at FiveThirtyEight call an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“inelastic” electorate</a>, or an electorate for which factors like the political environment and candidate traits are unlikely to sway voters because so few voters are swing voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This lack of a gap in Georgia’s statewide elections is clear when we examine elections dating back to 2002, which is arguably when Georgia’s current political era began — that year, Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/10/us/2002-election-georgia-bush-s-push-eager-volunteers-big-turnout-led-georgia-sweep.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the governorship and captured a state-legislative chamber</a> for the first time since Reconstruction. For instance, when we compare the outcomes in each pair of presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races in years when two of those races were on the ballot,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one year, 2020, had three statewide races since Georgia had a special election for Senate that November. It was a jungle primary, however, and is not listed in the table, though the runoff held in January 2021 is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> the margins in these high-profile races usually differed only to a small extent, as the table below shows.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Although each year and race had its own set of particulars, six of these eight sets of elections saw only small differences in margin — less than 3 points. The exceptions were the 2010 midterms and 2016 presidential election, when there was a wide gap between the Senate election and the other statewide election. (Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson was up both years, so <a href="https://www.georgiapol.com/2016/11/22/deeper-dive-gwinnetts-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he may have given the GOP</a> a lift as an incumbent; also former Gov. Roy Barnes served as the Democrats’ nominee for governor in 2010, and <a href="https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/roy-barnes-on-the-confederate-flag-and-where-the-south-needs-to-go-from-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his past appeal</a> in more conservative parts of the state may have made that race closer than it would’ve been otherwise.) But these elections were the exception, not the norm. Even the state’s most recent elections, the 2020 presidential election and 2021 Senate runoffs, featured elections with very similar margins — although they might be evidence that the overall political climate in Georgia is shifting toward Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s notable, then, that the FiveThirtyEight forecast shows such a large divide between the Senate and governor races in its average projected vote share. The forecast currently<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> has Kemp with a 6-point lead and Warnock with about a 1-point lead, which would amount to a 7-point gap between the two races. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a number of potential explanations for this gap, but the biggest factor might be incumbency and, more importantly, that Georgia’s top two races feature incumbents from different parties — Kemp is a Republican and Warnock a Democrat. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Seth-Mckee/publication/326886553_Nationalization_in_US_Senate_and_Gubernatorial_Elections/links/5f221f58a6fdcccc4399348a/Nationalization-in-US-Senate-and-Gubernatorial-Elections.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incumbency does not provide as strong</a> a tailwind as it once did, but both Kemp and Warnock are relatively popular politicians who could each win. From April through June, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/07/19/democratic-governors-are-resisting-bidens-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult’s polling</a> gave Kemp a 52 percent approval rating and only a 39 percent disapproval rating; <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/07/25/murkowski-experiences-mid-campaign-approval-bump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warnock</a>, meanwhile, had an approval rating of about 47 percent and a disapproval rating of 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, there isn’t <em>that</em> much difference between Kemp’s and Warnock’s standing in Georgia. However, given that the gap between the two races is unlikely to remain this large and that Kemp has a healthier lead over Abrams than Warnock has over Walker, voters who split their tickets could matter a lot for Warnock. And two polls, one from Emerson College <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/georgia-2022-walker-holds-two-point-lead-over-warnock-in-tight-senate-race-kemp-leads-abrams-by-four/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released last week</a> and a <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/ef9384ab-GA-crosstabs_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-July-22-26_released-July-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July survey</a> from Beacon Research/Shaw &amp; Company on behalf of Fox News, show how different degrees of Kemp voters backing Warnock could matter. In Emerson’s poll, only 3 percent of Kemp supporters backed Warnock, and overall, Walker led by 2 points. In the Fox News survey, meanwhile, 8 percent of Kemp’s supporters backed Warnock, and overall, Warnock led by 4 points. The takeaway here is that higher levels of support for Warnock among Kemp voters would seemingly boost the incumbent senator’s chances of finishing ahead of Walker. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not to say that only split-ticket voting will matter to the outcomes in each race; turnout and the overall political environment are also important. But Warnock would be in much better shape if he could capture 8 percent of Kemp’s voters versus just 3 percent: Based <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2018&amp;fips=13&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the 2018 governor’s race</a>, that could be a difference of roughly 100,000 votes, or about 2.5 percent of ballots cast. In a close contest, that’s a big deal — case in point, Kemp defeated Abrams by just 55,000 votes four years ago.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, there’s one other wrinkle with Georgia: If no candidate wins an outright majority of the vote, a runoff between the top-two finishers <a href="https://www.sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/forms/2022%20State%20Scheduled%20Elections%20Short%20Calendar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will take place</a> on Dec. 6, 2022.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a change from the 2020 cycle, when the Senate runoffs took place in January 2021. The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Georgia voting law passed early in 2021&lt;/a&gt; contained many changes for voting rules, including a shift in the runoff date for federal elections to four weeks after the regular election, instead of nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a> And considering each contest has a Libertarian candidate, which is notable because Libertarians have averaged a little over 2 percent in statewide races dating back to 2002, it’s entirely possible that if the Senate race is <em>especially</em> tight, a Libertarian candidate who gains 1 or 2 percent of the vote could trigger a Warnock-Walker runoff in December. Currently,<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> the FiveThirtyEight forecast gives the Senate race about a 1-in-5 chance of going to a runoff, while the governor’s race has about a 1-in-10 chance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, it’s too soon to say how the races in Georgia will change, but with two months to go until Election Day, we’ll be keeping a close eye on Peach State polls to see whether the gap between the two contests remains large or narrows.</p>

			<title>Where Candidates Who Deny The 2020 Election Results Are On The Ballot — And Where They Could Win</title>

			<category>Election Deniers</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>From Connecticut to California, Montana to Florida, election denialism has spread across the country. Candidates who support former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen will appear on ballots in nearly every state this fall. FiveThirtyEight drew on news reports, debate footage, campaign materials, social media and reached out to every single Republican nominee for the House, Senate, governor, secretary of state and attorney general to determine their position on the 2020 election.</p>
<p>There are a lot of election deniers on the ballot. Out of 529 total Republican nominees running for office, we found 195 who FULLY DENIED the legitimacy of the 2020 election. These candidates either clearly stated that the election was stolen from Trump or took legal action to overturn the results, such as voting not to certify election results or joining lawsuits that sought to overturn the election.</p>
<p>Moreover, an additional 61 candidates RAISED QUESTIONS around the results of the 2020 election. These candidates haven’t gone so far as to say explicitly that the election was stolen or take legal action to overturn it. However, they haven’t said the election was legitimate either. In fact, they have raised doubts about potential fraud.</p>
<p>There were 115 candidates whose position on the 2020 election we could not determine. They either had NO COMMENT on the 2020 election or AVOIDED ANSWERING when asked directly.</p>
<p>But not all Republicans running embrace Trump’s claims. A total of 71 have FULLY ACCEPTED the results of the 2020 election while another 87 have ACCEPTED WITH RESERVATIONS, meaning they think President Biden won, but still raised concerns about the integrity of the election.</p>
<p>In the House, many of these election deniers look poised to win. Using the latest data from the 2022 midterm election <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, we can see that 118 election deniers and eight election doubters have at least a 95 percent chance of winning. Several additional candidates who have denied the election are in competitive races.</p>
<p>In the Senate, though, there will be far fewer election deniers. Only three election deniers are safe bets to join the seven senators not up for reelection who objected to the certification of the 2020 election. However, a handful more still have a real shot at winning.</p>
<p>In governors races, more election deniers stand to prevail. At least two election deniers and four election doubters are poised to be inaugurated as governors next year. And we can’t rule out election deniers being elected governor of swing states like Arizona and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p tabindex="0">We don’t forecast elections for attorney general or secretary of state, but there are also seven election deniers running for attorney general and six for secretary of state, the post that oversees election administration in most states.</p>
<p tabindex="0">Indeed, an election denier winning election and taking office is more than a symbolic concern. An election-denying secretary of state could refuse to certify an election that he or she believes was rigged. An election-denying governor could attempt to submit electoral votes that defy the will of the people. And election-denying senators and representatives could vote to count those electoral votes. The 2022 election will determine how many of these candidates get that chance.</p>
<h3>Are election deniers running in your state?</h3>

<p data-paragraph="main">Massachusetts has an opening in its corner office. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker is retiring, and in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/09/02/elec04.prez.kerry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-elizabeth-warren-could-win-the-2020-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-seth-moulton-could-win-the-2020-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-announces-2012-presidential-bid/2011/06/02/AG05iJHH_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortage</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/01/marty-walsh-massachusetts-governor-523620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/massachusetts-playbook/2022/03/28/clark-plays-coy-about-becoming-speaker-00020774" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-deval-patrick-is-making-a-late-bid-for-the-democratic-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicians</a>, you’d expect there to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Artery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Artery</a>-worthy traffic jam to take his place. But instead, more than two months before Election Day, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s already safe</a> for Democratic Attorney General Maura Healey to start picking out <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2013/11/20/its-curtains-for-govs-drapes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new drapes</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So how did the race to govern the nation’s <a href="https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/census-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15th largest state</a>, the <a href="https://historyofmassachusetts.org/massachusetts-american-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birthplace of the American Revolution</a>, the hub of New England (if not the <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/2017/08/30/local-news/beantown-hub-how-did-boston-earn-its-nicknames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universe</a>) — and, if you couldn’t already tell, my home state — get so uncompetitive?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It wasn’t always. A year ago, it looked like <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleI/Chapter2/Section35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bay Staters</a> were in for not one, but two competitive gubernatorial primaries. <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/06/14/massachusetts-danielle-allen-gubernatorial-run-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard professor Danielle Allen</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ri-state-wire-ma-state-wire-campaigns-race-and-ethnicity-health-13d18bd9989acdd046e9558c2b46b7a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz</a> and <a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2021/02/former-state-sen-ben-downing-launches-campaign-for-massachusetts-governor-says-leadership-to-tackle-states-big-challenges-is-sorely-lacking.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former state Sen. Ben Downing</a> were all running on the Democratic side, while <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/07/04/metro/geoff-diehl-announces-bid-governor-first-republican-step-into-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former state Rep. Geoff Diehl</a> was challenging Baker in the Republican primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Normally, a primary challenge to a sitting governor would be a fool’s errand, but Baker is <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2021/01/25/charlie-baker-faces-unrest-in-massgop-over-trumps-second-impeachment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no favorite of the GOP base</a>. Part of a long-running tradition of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/republican-governors-new-england-defy-blue-wave/574726/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate, even liberal, Republican governors</a> in the Northeast, Baker has worked with the Democratic legislature to <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/11/science/baker-signs-major-climate-bill-into-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fight climate change</a> and <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/07/29/gov-baker-signs-bill-protecting-abortion-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect abortion rights</a>, and he even came out in favor of <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2021/01/13/charlie-baker-says-he-supports-second-trump-impeachment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impeaching former President Donald Trump</a> for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Baker’s approval rating among Republicans, in other words, wasn’t great. It was only 35 percent in November 2021, according to a <a href="https://osf.io/gcuq4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID States Project poll</a>. And after Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-charlie-baker-massachusetts-elections-e5148f198e3311106786e81cefc4568d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Diehl</a>, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PNyPSWiD53_Q19bYlmXQaBmcakYJ1kjP/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Polling survey</a> sponsored by the Democratic Governors Association (admittedly, not a disinterested party) found Diehl beating Baker in the GOP primary by 21 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Baker denied that fear of losing the primary had anything to do with it, but he <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/01/metro/baker-telling-allies-he-isnt-running-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled the plug</a> in December 2021, and his decision not to run for reelection changed the trajectory of the race for both parties. On the very day of Baker’s retirement, speculation turned to whether Healey, a rising Democratic star, would <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/01/metro/bakers-decision-not-seek-reelection-rekindles-interest-some-public-denials-among-might-be-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch a campaign</a>. With Healey’s candidacy (and $3.3 million war chest) looming, Downing <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/12/28/ben-downing-out-race-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out of the race</a> a few weeks later. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Healey officially <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/01/19/attorney-general-healey-announces-gubernatoril-run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw her hat into the ring</a> in January, and she immediately crowded out the remaining candidates. A <a href="https://www.massincpolling.com/the-topline/poll-release-new-numbers-on-2022-democratic-primary-races" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January poll</a> of the Democratic primary from MassINC Polling Group gave her 48 percent to Chang-Díaz’s 12 percent and Allen’s 3 percent. Less than a month later, Allen was <a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2022/02/harvard-professor-danielle-allen-dropping-out-of-democratic-race-for-massachusetts-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of the race</a> too. Chang-Díaz hung in there a little longer, but still facing a 33-point deficit in a <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/PrimaryToplinesSpring2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June poll</a> from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, she announced on June 23 that she had “no path” to win the primary and was <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2022/06/23/sonia-chang-diaz-drops-out-of-race-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping out too</a>. Although Chang-Díaz’s name is still appearing on ballots, Healey is now essentially unopposed in Tuesday’s Democratic primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it doesn’t look like she’ll have much trouble in the general election either. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poll after poll</a> has given Healey a commanding lead, most recently <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/07/26/metro/suffocating-sense-unease-mass-residents-stressed-by-inflation-supreme-court-decisions-new-poll-finds/?s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Atwitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University</a> in July (Healey 54 percent, Diehl 23 percent). And according to all three versions of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight midterm forecast</a>, Healey has a greater than 99 in 100 chance of beating Diehl.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Sept. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> That makes Massachusetts the most likely governorship to change parties in the 2022 election — just behind <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a>, another blue state where a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/07/20/larry-hogan-future-dan-cox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate Republican governor is retiring</a> and Republicans have nominated a diehard Trump supporter to replace him.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that Massachusetts has elected only one Democratic governor since 1990, and it’s true that Baker is currently one of the <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/07/19/democratic-governors-are-resisting-bidens-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular governors in the country</a>. But as partisanship comes to hold <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-politics-is-presidential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater and greater sway over gubernatorial elections</a>, Massachusetts may simply be too Democratic (according to FiveThirtyEight partisan lean,<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> it’s the bluest state in the country) to elect another Republican governor — especially one as Trumpy as Diehl.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Granted, Diehl still has to win his own primary on Tuesday — and some Republicans believe they could still win in November if they nominate self-described “<a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/08/04/mass-governor-chris-doughty-republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pragmatic businessman</a>” Chris Doughty. But Doughty’s belief that Trump lost the 2020 election and promise to keep abortion legal in Massachusetts are unlikely to fly in a Republican primary: An <a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/fiscalalliancefoundation/pages/72/attachments/original/1661436447/Fiscal_Alliance_August_2022_Primary_Poll_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August poll</a> from Advantage/Fiscal Alliance Foundation gave Diehl a 42-percent-to-27-percent lead. And even if Doughty <em>were</em> to upset Diehl in the primary, <a href="https://www.uml.edu/docs/2022-Mass-Voters-Issues-Topline_tcm18-353564.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/massachusetts-2022-democrats-eye-gubernatorial-pick-up-in-massachusetts-a-g-maura-healey-leads-geoff-diehl-in-general-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently</a> suggest he would do just as poorly as Diehl in the general election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Healey is in good shape — not only to flip the Massachusetts governor’s office from red to blue, but also to make history. She would be the <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/boston/2022/06/24/maura-healey-likely-massachusetts-first-female-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first woman elected governor of Massachusetts</a> and the <a href="https://www.outfrontmagazine.com/america-could-have-two-lesbian-governors-come-election-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first openly lesbian governor of any state</a>.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic nominee for governor of Oregon, Tina Kotek, would share this distinction if elected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> So no matter what happens in the midterms elsewhere in the country, Massachusetts will give Democrats at least one thing to celebrate.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Upset Democratic special election wins in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/31/democrat-peltola-beats-palin-in-alaska-special-election-upset-00054428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/nyregion/pat-ryan-special-election-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a> over the past two weeks are the latest sign that the political environment might be unusual for a midterm election. Frankly, the results since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked more like 2018 than 2020</a>, with Democrats competitive even in red-leaning districts. That probably won’t hold. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if it’s just a neutral year — as the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot currently shows</a> — Democrats would probably be pleased. It would likely be enough for them to hold the Senate, and even gain a seat or two. It would even give them a chance in the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Or maybe not. Democrats are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting against a <em>lot</em> of midterm election history</a> where the president’s party typically does poorly. They’ve also benefited from a turnout advantage in recent special elections that may not be replicated in November. The FiveThirtyEight forecast does not consider the special election results and hedges based on these historical trends; it’s why it still has Republicans as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75 percent favorites to keep the House</a>, although <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ chances of retaining the Senate</a> continue to improve and are now 68 percent.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, whenever a Democrat gets elected in Alaska — even given the quirks of the instant-runoff process in the state — it’s probably worth asking again if things could go really badly for the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last month, I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examined a series of what I called asterisk midterm elections</a>. These were the midterms that were the exceptions to the rule: When the president’s party actually gained seats in the House, or at least fought things to a near-draw while gaining in the Senate. The elections were 1934, 1962, 1998 and 2002, and three of the four involved some type of national emergency (the Great Depression, the Cuban missile crisis and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks). The 1998 midterm was the exception to this, but it did have a national controversy of its own — a backlash to Republican overreach on the Monica Lewinsky scandal and subsequent impeachment trial. I argued that 2022 has some features in common with these elections, but it had the most in common with 1998 given the partisan overreach that is happening now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In particular, the involvement of former President Donald Trump makes 2022 different than almost any other midterm.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, we’re used to Trump’s ubiquity in American political life. But this degree of involvement from a former president — or, for that matter, even an ex-presidential <em>candidate</em> — is highly unusual. Take a look, for example, at the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2008-01-01%202022-09-01&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0cqt90,%2Fm%2F0d06m5,%2Fm%2F02mjmr,%2Fm%2F09b6zr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amount of Google search traffic for Trump</a> as compared with other former presidents.</p>

Bush kept a very low profile after completing their second terms. And the previous losing candidate before Trump, Hillary Clinton, famously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-the-chappaqua-woods-a-search-for-hillary-clinton/2016/12/17/60daea40-c3c0-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retreated to the woods</a> in Chappaqua, New York, after 2016. Their search traffic quickly dropped to near-zero once their campaigns or presidencies were over, and then stayed there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s search traffic, meanwhile, is much less than during his presidency, but it’s still fairly high. Over the past year, in fact, there’s been <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F012gx2,%2Fm%2F0cqt90" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about as much search traffic</a> for Trump as for the current president, Joe Biden!</p>

Part of that is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-endorsees-have-started-losing-more-but-dont-read-into-that-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the string of endorsements</a> he’s made in Republican primaries, but the bigger factor is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/politics/trump-documents-search-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBI’s seizure of classified documents</a> he had in his possession at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When that seizure occurred, a certain strain of conventional wisdom <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3610835-the-mar-a-lago-raid-gave-republicans-an-unexpected-second-wind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested that this could help Republicans in the midterms</a>, such as by increasing the enthusiasm of GOP voters.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/trump-fbi-mar-a-lago-search-gop-rallies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;strain of conventional wisdom&lt;/a&gt; that suggests the Mar-a-Lago seizure could help Trump’s nomination chances in 2024. I think that case is overstated, but that’s beyond the scope of our article today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>15</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If that’s true, it’s not showing up in the data. The past four special elections — two in New York, one in Alaska and one in Minnesota — all occurred after the seizure on Aug. 8, and they all showed excellent results for Democrats. And Democrats have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actually gained about a point</a> on the generic ballot since then, although it’s a small enough difference that it could be statistical noise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not exactly some genius insight to suggest that Trump could cause problems for Republicans in the midterms. At the very least, he’s directly put their prospects at risk by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-hard-to-win-a-senate-race-when-youve-never-won-an-election-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsing inexperienced candidates</a> like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blake Masters in Arizona</a>, who are badly underperforming partisan benchmarks in their states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also the case that Trump’s continued dominance over the GOP violates a potentially key assumption behind the “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">midterm curse</a>,” which is that a party usually tries to pivot away from its losing candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sometimes that pivot involves providing voters a menu of new policy options, such as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/01/20/republican-midterm-plan-education-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP’s “Contract with America” in 1994</a>. Many times it’s a pivot to the center, though it doesn’t need to be; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/politics/tea-party-greatest-hits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the tea party movement in 2010 was more conservative</a> in some ways than Bush, but it still offered voters something a little different.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The pivot doesn’t necessarily need to involve a new figurehead for the party, either. It probably helps if you don’t have one, in fact, since then you can frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent party’s performance and <a href="https://themonkeycage.org/2010/06/the_public_is_a_thermostat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take advantage of thermostatic changes in public opinion</a> rather than as a choice between imperfect alternatives, as presidential elections turn into. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2018, for instance, Trump gave Democrats <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/10/25/poll-midterm-elections-donald-trump-democrats/1742432002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of ammunition to run on</a>, and they nominated different kinds of candidates in different kinds of districts while preparing for a very large presidential primary field. What you didn’t see, though, was a lot of Clinton, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/politics/clinton-illinois-campaign-event" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t make her first campaign appearance until October</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s play out that counterfactual, though. Imagine that, in 2018, Clinton had been very active on the campaign trail, endorsing candidates that often went against the wishes of the party establishment, repeatedly claiming that the 2016 election had been stolen — and then there had been a FBI seizure of classified secretary of state records in Chappaqua. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Would that have helped Democrats in the midterms? Probably not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if anything, Republicans are doubling down on Trump and Trumpism. This week, he <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-demands-redo-2020-election-1234583872/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demanded a redo of the 2020 election</a>. The leading candidate for the 2024 nomination <em>apart</em> from Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/08/desantis-trump-fbi-00050462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended Trump after the Mar-a-Lago search</a> and has even <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-desantis-rip-off-complaints-1234583383/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come to mimic</a> some of his mannerisms and manners of speech. Republicans have had <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/08/15/has-trump-put-the-republican-party-in-danger-of-repeating-the-2010-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems with candidate quality</a> in Senate and gubernatorial races before, but this year, inexperienced and/or very right-wing candidates — often ones endorsed by Trump — are the rule and not the exception.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All that said, I still think the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe — and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/10/inflation-rate-drops-in-july-but-cpi-prices-remain-high.html#:~:text=Inflation%20dropped%200.6%25%20from%20its,predicted%20a%20rate%20of%208.7%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">maybe declining inflation</a> — are the more important factors in Democrats’ recent surge. But Republicans are behaving in atypical ways for an opposition party in the midterms, and they may get an atypically poor outcome as a result.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">After hitting a low of 37.5 percent in July, President Biden’s approval rating has ticked up over 5 percentage points in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?ex_cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>. While he’s still underwater, at 42.7 percent,<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> it is nonetheless a substantial change. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="920" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But will Biden’s upswing continue?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not a huge mystery why some voters — especially Biden’s own — might be happier with his administration: He’s delivered on quite a few campaign promises recently. After Democratic leaders spent months trying to gain West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s support for broad economic and climate-change legislation, Manchin <a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-supports-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally agreed to a compromise</a> at the end of July, and Biden signed the law, the Inflation Reduction Act, on Aug. 16. Among other things, the law <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/07/senate-inflation-reduction-act-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces prescription drug prices for seniors and invests broadly in green energy</a>, including through <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/calculate-bidens-inflation-reduction-act-save/story?id=88458834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax credits to consumers</a> who buy environmentally friendly goods like electric vehicles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Inflation Reduction Act came after an already busy summer stretch, too. At the end of June, Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/biden-signs-bipartisan-gun-safety-package-law/story?id=85692952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a bipartisan gun-safety bill</a>, the first major legislation on the issue <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/understanding-1994-assault-weapons-ban-ended/story?id=65546858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in about 28 years</a>. Meanwhile, on Aug. 1, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-killing-al-qaeda-leader-kabul-justice/story?id=87768565" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he announced that the U.S. had killed</a> Ayman al-Zawahiri, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/08/01/al-qaeda-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri-killed-drone-strike-afghanistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who became the al-Qaeda leader</a> after Osama bin Laden’s death in 2011, in a drone strike. That news struck the opposite tone from the big foreign-policy story last August that arguably started Biden’s downward approval trajectory: the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/07/17/media-bias-role-biden-approval-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messy withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and the critical news coverage that followed</a>. And on Aug. 10, Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-signs-pact-act-expanding-streamlining-care-veterans/story?id=88192474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed legislation</a> that makes it easier for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan to receive medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s too recent to be picked up in much polling, but last week Biden also <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced up to $20,000 of student loan forgiveness</a>, keeping a promise he made on the campaign trail in 2020. So far, a <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3854" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University poll conducted Aug. 25-29</a> found that Americans approved of the plan, 53 percent to 43 percent. The move was long <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/25/student-debt-relief-biden-activists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a priority of the left wing of Biden’s base</a>. It might also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-lost-the-support-of-young-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help him with young voters</a> — whom Biden has struggled with lately — as they are more likely to have student loan debt and are worried about their future financial independence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But more than the impact of any one legislative action, it is likely the steady stream of news that has helped Biden the most. The administration is finally <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-ap-top-news-health-care-reform-or-state-wire-2b31c3acef65d01cc90dd7aafe2c5867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticking items off a long to-do list</a>, helping to counter the narrative that the White House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/08/president-joe-biden-running-out-of-time-00044636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t getting much done</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, both <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/24/biden-approval-rating-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398117/biden-job-rating-rises-highest-year.aspx?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_term=gallupnews&amp;utm_content=1877a63b-65bb-404a-b5d0-a941271cd689&amp;utm_campaign=gallup_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> found that Biden’s approval went up not just with Democrats but also with independents. In the Gallup poll, Biden’s approval jumped 9 points with <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398117/biden-job-rating-rises-highest-year.aspx?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_term=gallupnews&amp;utm_content=1877a63b-65bb-404a-b5d0-a941271cd689&amp;utm_campaign=gallup_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independents since July</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is likely because there is more at play than legislative victories. Namely, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/inflation-eases-consumer-prices-rise-63-july-88890525" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation seems to be cooling</a>, which could hint at a more basic reason for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why Biden’s disapproval has declined</a>: Gas prices <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have steadily tumbled</a> since hitting their peak in June. On top of that, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/30/business/economy/jolts-jobs-economy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job market remains strong</a>. Americans’ worry about the economy <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398963/economic-confidence-improving-weak.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also seems to be easing some</a>. The Quinnipiac poll found that Americans’ <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3854" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval of Biden’s handling of the economy</a> had changed the most of any issue surveyed, jumping to 37 percent from 28 percent in July. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible, too, that the overall political environment is just better than expected for Democrats. Since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in June, Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have outperformed expectations in special elections</a>. They’ve also improved their standing <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the generic ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they’d support in the race for Congress, signaling that 2022 could be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unusual midterm election</a>. (Historically, the president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually struggles in the midterms</a>.) In some ways, then, Biden’s approval rating is a lagging indicator of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the change in fortune</a> Democrats were already experiencing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the meantime, former President Donald Trump continues to dominate the news after the FBI searched his home in Florida for classified information he kept there in violation of the Presidential Records Act, which requires presidents to turn over any written materials related to their official duties. Information continues to pour out about the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-responds-trumps-call-special-master-review-materials/story?id=89044148" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sensitive documents found there</a>. It’s unclear how much this episode will help or hurt Trump, but polls do show that most Americans are <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/24/biden-approval-rating-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aware of this news</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/from-mueller-to-mar-a-lago-americans-remain-divided-on-trumps-legal-jeopardy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think it’s a problem</a>. During his 2020 campaign, Biden promised <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/20/18631452/joe-biden-2020-presidential-announcement-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a return to normalcy</a> after Trump’s tumultuous tenure, so it’s not unreasonable to think that the news from Mar-a-Lago might remind some voters why they chose Biden in the first place. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, the midterms are still two months away, and Biden still has <em>two</em> more years in his first term. Given the volatility of the past month in his approval rating, there’s still plenty of time for it to go down once more. Then again, maybe Biden is, at long last, on the rebound.</p>



<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>Republicans are more likely than Democrats to view military and law enforcement organizations favorably — except when it comes to the FBI or Capitol Police. According to an Aug. 20-23 <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/26/how-americans-feel-about-law-enforcement-and-milit">poll from The Economist/YouGov</a>, just one-third of Republicans (35 percent) have a very or somewhat favorable perception of the FBI, which is a huge difference from the share who have positive views on the Army (93 percent) or local police forces (87 percent). It also greatly varies from how Democrats view the FBI (72 percent have a favorable opinion). Views toward law enforcement also varied widely by age, with 91 percent of Americans age 65 or older viewing local police favorably versus only 51 percent of those ages 18 to 29.</li><li>It’s not just inflation. Americans are also experiencing “shrinkflation,” the trend in which product quantity decreases despite stagnant or rising prices, especially in grocery stores. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/29/consumer-sensitivity-to-shrinkflation/">Morning Consult</a> recently found that about two-thirds of Americans are very (33 percent) or somewhat concerned (32 percent) about the trend, and those who’ve noticed it are pursuing a host of different options. About half of respondents who’ve noticed shrinkflation said they’ve instead purchased a different brand (49 percent), while a similar percentage (48 percent) reported opting for the generic product. Thirty-three percent have also chosen to buy affected items in bulk, rather than in smaller quantities. Meanwhile, 30 percent said shrinkflation has led them to stop purchasing from a particular brand altogether. </li><li>Parents of school-aged children are less likely than other Americans to support COVID-19 restrictions and protocols, per <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/30/parents-more-likely-oppose-pandemic-rules-poll">a YouGov survey</a> conducted Aug. 3-5. Asked about a hypothetical future pandemic, 38 percent said they would oppose vaccine requirements, compared with 31 percent of all adults. The survey, however, revealed glaring differences between parents of kids in school based on their 2020 ballot: Sixty-six percent of parents who voted for Biden would favor future vaccine requirements, while only 20 percent of those who voted for Trump agreed.</li><li>An overwhelming share of Americans predominantly pay for items electronically, as opposed to in cash. A July 5-26 <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/397718/americans-using-cash-less-often-foresee-cashless-society.aspx?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_term=gallupnews&amp;utm_content=b7990fc1-aa25-43ca-ab23-67da5b83a114&amp;utm_campaign=gallup_news">poll from Gallup</a> revealed that almost three-quarters use cash for less than half (13 percent), only a few (49 percent) or none (11 percent) of their purchases, while the other quarter uses cash for half (13 percent), most (8 percent) or all (5 percent) of their purchases. Yet the breakdown is inconsistent across income brackets. A far larger share of those from households annually making less than $40,000 use cash for at least half of their purchases (41 percent), compared with those with household incomes above $100,000 (14 percent). Further, respondents felt a shift in usage from five years ago, when 53 percent said they paid in cash for at least half of their purchases. And with 64 percent of adults saying the U.S. is likely to become a cashless society in their lifetime, that trend seems to fit the bill.</li></ul><h2>Biden approval</h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrat and former state Rep. Mary Peltola won Alaska’s special congressional election on Wednesday, defeating Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich III. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, senior elections analyst Nathaniel Rakich discusses why it is difficult to draw a broader conclusion about the political environment based on the result. Later, senior politics reporter Monica Potts joins to discuss why voters sometimes contradict their partisan beliefs when it comes to voting on ballot measures.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For the second time in as many weeks, Democrats have won a competitive special election. And by the numbers, this win was even more impressive than <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week’s victory in New York’s 19th District</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday, the Alaska Division of Elections announced that former state Rep. Mary Peltola had defeated former Gov. Sarah Palin in the special election for the state’s vacant U.S. House seat, becoming the <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/08/31/democrat-mary-peltola-wins-special-us-house-election-will-be-first-alaska-native-elected-to-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Alaska Native ever elected to Congress</a> and the first Democrat to win a statewide election since 2008. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although the actual election took place on Aug. 16, we had to wait until Aug. 31 to learn the results because of Alaska’s new system of ranked choice voting. Instead of picking just one candidate, as voters do in most other states, Alaskans were invited to rank the three candidates on the ballot in the order of their preference. <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22SSPG/RcvDetailedReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">And after all ballots were counted</a>, 40 percent of voters had chosen Peltola as their first choice, 31 percent had chosen Palin and 29 percent had chosen Republican businessman Nick Begich III. Under the rules of ranked choice voting, Begich — as the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes — was then eliminated, and his votes were redistributed to whomever his voters ranked second.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unsurprisingly, most of Begich’s votes (50 percent) went to his fellow Republican, Palin. But an impressive 29 percent went to Peltola, and 21 percent were “exhausted,” meaning there was no second-choice pick, and the votes were essentially thrown out. That combination was enough for Peltola to win. While Palin gained more votes from the redistribution than Peltola did, Peltola was starting from a higher total, and receiving 29 percent of Begich’s votes was enough to keep her ahead of Palin. In the end, Peltola received 51 percent of the votes counted in the final round, while Palin received 49 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Impressively, Peltola managed to prevail despite Alaska being a fairly red state. According to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric,<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> Alaska is 15 percentage points redder than the nation as a whole. That means going by the results in the final round, Peltola’s 3-point victory<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peltola’s precise share of the vote was 51.47 percent while Palin’s was 48.53 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> was an <em>18-point</em> overperformance for Democrats. By contrast, last week, Democrat Pat Ryan won New York’s 19th District, an R+4 seat, by 2 points — just a 6-point overperformance.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have clearly overperformed in special elections since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson in June, but the reasons for Peltola’s win may have been more local than national. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Namely, Palin was a very flawed candidate. After her 2008 vice-presidential campaign <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2008/10/06/post-debate-palin-still-seen-as-unqualified-a-bump-for-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flopped</a>, Palin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/us/politics/04palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned the governorship</a> (reportedly amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/us/06palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethics investigations</a>), <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2016/01/13/a-peek-inside-sarah-palins-arizona-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought a house in Arizona</a> and went on to <a href="https://ew.com/tv/sarah-palin-masked-singer-walking-middle-finger-haters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appear on reality TV</a> — giving many Alaskans the sense that she had <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/18/1093080089/sarah-palin-is-attempting-a-comeback-in-alaska-but-her-star-has-dimmed-at-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoned them</a>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833494220304384" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July poll</a> from Alaska Survey Research, 61 percent of Alaska registered voters had a negative opinion of her. It’s hard to win with those kinds of numbers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It seems likely then, that had a different Republican advanced to the final round, Peltola would have lost. According to that same poll — which <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833489212346368?s=20&amp;t=Isc_PKtRNZC887AFM4LdQQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost exactly nailed</a> the final margin between Peltola and Palin — Begich would have defeated Peltola <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833483625545728?s=20&amp;t=Isc_PKtRNZC887AFM4LdQQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 percent to 45 percent</a> if he had made it to the final round instead of her. That would still have been bluer than Alaska’s R+15 partisan lean, but it mostly demonstrates how much of Republicans’ underperformance here may have been due to simple candidate quality (or lack thereof).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, that Republican underperformance disappears if you look not at the results from the final round, but rather at only first-choice votes. Sixty percent of voters selected a Republican (either Palin or Begich) as their preferred candidate, while only 40 percent selected a Democrat (Peltola), perhaps a better gauge of their actual partisan preferences. In fact, by that metric, the Alaska special election was actually an <em>over</em>performance for Republicans. Their 20-point combined margin over Peltola was 5 points better than the state’s R+15 partisan lean.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it’s not clear what, if any, national lessons we can take away from the Alaska election. But that’s OK — because you should <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-special-election-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never generalize based on a single special election</a>. They are simply too prone to idiosyncrasies such as, for example, a uniquely flawed candidate. Instead, you have to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average several special elections together</a> before they become <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictive of the midterms</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And when we do that, it’s clear that, no matter how you count Alaska, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are punching above their weight</a> in special elections since Dobbs. Other than Alaska, there have been four federal special elections since that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-overturns-roe-wade-landmark-case-abortion/story?id=85160781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 24 decision</a>, and Democrats did at least 6 points better than the partisan lean of the districts they ran in each election. If you plug in Alaska’s first-round numbers (the ones that are good for Republicans), the average Democratic overperformance in special elections since Dobbs is 7 points. If you use the final-round numbers (i.e., Peltola’s 3-point defeat of Palin), it’s 11 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, while Peltola’s victory is a nice morale boost for Democrats, an extra vote for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, an important milestone for Alaska Natives and, of course, undoubtedly a thrill for Peltola herself, it’s also kind of beside the point for purposes of predicting the midterms. We already knew that something — probably Dobbs — had <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted the national environment in Democrats’ favor</a> since midsummer. The Alaska result is, at best, consistent with that and, at worst, doesn’t contradict it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we also know that things <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-midterm-chances-dont-hinge-on-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically get worse for the president’s party</a> in the midterm home stretch. There are still more than two months left until Election Day — plenty of time for the political winds to shift once again.</p>]]></description>

<p>FiveThirtyEight’s Senate and House forecasts are based on myriad factors, with changes in one race often influencing odds in another. To see just how much individual races can change the forecast, first try picking different winners in key Senate races (or feel free to <a tabindex="0">skip ahead to key races in the House</a>!).<a tabindex="0" data-number="1" aria-label="Footnote 1. Select to expand footnote.">1</a> But beware, the choices you make in the Senate affect the House, and vice versa.</p>

<strong>Republicans</strong> win the House<strong aria-hidden="true">43 in 100</strong><strong>Democrats</strong> win <strong>both</strong> chambers<strong aria-hidden="true">23 in 100</strong>Odds displayed in the graphics may not match numeric odds due to rounding.</p>
<p>How this works: We start with the 40,000 simulations that our election forecast runs every time it updates. When you choose the winner of a race, we throw out any simulations where the outcome you picked didn’t happen and recalculate each party’s chances of winning each chamber using just the remaining simulations. If you choose enough unlikely outcomes, we’ll eventually wind up with so few simulations that we can’t produce accurate results. When that happens, we go back to our full set of simulations and run a series of regressions to see how your scenario might look if it turned up more often.</p>
<p>In simplified terms, the regressions start off by looking at the vote share for each candidate in every simulation and seeing how the rest of the map changed in response to big or small wins. Let’s say you picked Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock to win Georgia. In some of our simulations, Warnock may have won Georgia very narrowly, and in others, he may have lost it very narrowly. But in simulations where he won Georgia by a big margin, Democrats may have also won big in toss-up races and pulled some Democratic-leaning races into their column, while the reverse may be true in simulations where Warnock lost Georgia by a wide margin. We figure out how every other race tended to look in that full range of scenarios, tracking not just whether other Democratic candidates usually won other races but also how much they generally won or lost each one by.</p>
<p>After all of that, we take some representative examples of scenarios that include the picks you made and use what we learned from our regression analysis to adjust all 40,000 simulations, and then recalculate win probabilities for each race and chamber of Congress. Finally, we blend those adjusted simulations with any of the original simulations that still apply and produce a final forecast.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Welcome to </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/voices-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Voices Of Color</em></strong></a><em>, a column that explores what’s on the mind of voters of color in this year’s midterm elections. Too often, media coverage focuses on the political preferences of white people with euphemisms like “</em><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/07/599573817/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-suburban-women-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>suburban women</em></a><em>” or “</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/1/10889138/coded-language-thug-bossy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>middle class</em></a><em>.” But in this column, we want to know what makes voters of color tick. </em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>We want to explore their views on politics, policy, the future of our democracy, our two-party system and everything in between. We hope that this column offers fresh perspectives from the minds of those whose political opinions are often overlooked </em><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>or assumed</em></a><em>.

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Voting is always a family affair for Mario Reynoso. “We all get our absentee ballots, we fill them out together and we talk about the candidates that we like. That’s the family that I grew up in,” he told me. But while the 30-year-old still plans to cast a ballot in this year’s midterm elections, Reynoso said he can’t get <em>as </em>excited about voting this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The main reason? President Biden and his lack of meaningful action on a number of policy issues important to Reynoso, including immigration and climate change — despite some recent Democratic victories on the latter.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, Biden and Democrats are experiencing <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/08/joe-biden-presidency-best-week-ever.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bit of an upswing</a>, thanks in part to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-sign-major-health-climate-tax-bill-tuesday/story?id=88412221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number</a> of recent <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-student-loan-move-shaped-intense-political-pressure/story?id=88796289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy successes</a>. Inflation has also slowed, and average gas prices have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/11/gas-prices-4-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fallen below $4 per gallon</a>. Still, these wins alone haven’t been enough for many Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters of color<em> </em>who see their rights and values under attack. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">With the GOP favored</a> to take control of the U.S. House and having a shot at the U.S. Senate in November, many of these voters are asking the Biden administration for stronger actions and reactions to Supreme Court rulings and the laws being pushed by Republican state legislatures. “Biden <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/30/biden-bipartisan-dealmaking-backfire-226758/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted himself</a> during his presidential campaign as being this sort of ‘great unifier,’ but he hasn’t been fully able to get everything done,” said Justice Gaines, 27, who ran for Providence City Council in 2018. “Fortunately, we did get the Inflation Reduction Act. But there’s still a lot of things that are important to more progressive voters that haven’t gotten done.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, since July, Biden’s approval among Black and Hispanic voters has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/biden-lags-generic-democratic-performance-key-voting-blocs-nbc-news-po-rcna44280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticked up slightly</a>, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s nowhere near</a> where it was when he first became president. Polling and reporting also suggests that Biden might have a long way to go to regain their favor. For example, a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22055879-2022-05-01-black-americans-trend-for-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post-Ipsos poll</a> conducted in April and May of this year found that Black voters were waning in their support for Biden due to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/04/biden-black-voters-softer-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unkept campaign promises</a> and were less enthusiastic about voting in this year’s midterm elections. Things like high inflation rates have also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hispanics-lose-faith-democrats-over-inflation-us-elections-loom-2022-05-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly pushed some Hispanic voters</a> further right. And limited polling on Asian American voters — who comprised about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 percent of the electorate</a> in 2020 — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/19/politics/democrats-asian-americans-biden-carter/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests that Biden</a> has lost some ground with them, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There are things that the Democratic Party does that I’m not happy with,” Neil Sharma, 19, told me. “I’m still going to vote for Democrats, but there are things I’d like to see the party change.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I wanted to better understand why so many Democrats of color were disillusioned and what motivates them to continue to vote for Democrats — even after admitting that the party hasn’t quite met their expectations. In total, I spoke with six voters of color (four Democrats; two left-leaning independent voters) who expressed disappointment with the party under Biden’s leadership. What I learned is that, despite their quibbles, it would take <em>a lot </em>for them to either: 1) not vote or 2) support a Republican candidate. (They’ll explain why below.) They also think the Democratic Party, as it is now, hasn’t done enough to foster a bench of younger candidates of color to eventually replace current leadership. “Today’s Democratic leaders need to step down and create space for younger, more creative, thinkers who are better connected with their communities,” said 34-year-old Laura Taylor. “Older politicians past the retirement age shouldn’t put their power or reputation above progress for our people.”</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: Why would you say you’re disillusioned with the Democratic Party? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mario Reynoso (Hispanic, 30, Washington, D.C.): Democrats don’t know what to do with Latinos and immigration. You see all these stories coming out about people brought to Washington, D.C., and the Democratic mayor wants nothing to do with them. And on the federal level, I just feel like leadership is kicking the can down the road with the Latino community and immigration.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">David Gonzalez (Hispanic, 43, Missouri): With Democrats having control of the<strong> </strong>presidency, U.S. House and U.S. Senate, I was feeling like more drastic, progressive change would happen. And it hasn’t. Even though the Supreme Court’s announcement in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health that it would overturn Roe v. Wade was a big flashpoint, there were warning signs from Republicans all along that this would happen — and that still wasn’t enough to motivate Democrats to do anything. So I think that there’s a lack of urgency among Democratic leaders. And frankly, there’s no energizing leaders in the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peter Lim (Filipino and white, 29, Michigan): My first early experiences with politics was during the 2012 election. At the time, I felt like there was a lot of hope and change, but over the last 10 years or so it feels like all that hope and change has been undone. It feels as if the Democratic Party as a whole is almost stagnated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Justice Gaines (Black, 27, Rhode Island): I was one of those voters who kind of sucked it up and voted for Biden because the Republican Party and [former President Donald] Trump were not something I could support. I feel like the Democratic Party likes to make lots of promises and encourages voters, particularly Black voters, like myself, and marginalized people to vote for them, and then they don’t show up when they’re elected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Do you feel like the Democratic Party represents you?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Neil Sharma (Indian American, 19, New York): I wouldn’t say that it represents <em>exactly</em> what I believe, but it represents enough of what I believe in. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Laura Taylor (French Creole, 34, New York): The Democratic Party leadership doesn’t represent me and doesn’t represent the majority of the country today. Most of us are not old, wealthy white people. Today’s leaders are out of touch with the average American’s needs and wants, and that’s why Democrats struggle to connect and communicate in ways that keep voters motivated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gonzalez: At the local level, there’s representation that’s in line with where I am. In St. Louis, we have a very electrifying progressive representative [Rep. Cori Bush] who I think is a great fit for us. But nationally, the party isn’t reflective of younger or more diverse voters, frankly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gaines:<strong> </strong>No, I think the Democratic Party today continues to represent itself. I’ve always seen the party protect its power and ability to gain voters at the expense of the people who vote for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What has the Democratic Party done under President Biden that you like?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Reynoso: Navigating us through the COVID-19 pandemic has been a high mark, and there’s a certain amount of bills passed in the last year, too, that I really liked, such as the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taylor: It was important to do pandemic stimulus to relieve the unprecedented economic and personal pain our country was struggling with. I also think that the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act was important. And Ketanji Brown Jackson is a game changer of a Supreme Court pick. It’s exciting and inspiring to see a brilliant woman who looks like my aunts and friends on the bench of the most powerful court in the country. And I can’t believe I almost forgot this, but having Deb Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary, who is also a woman, in charge of our lands feels like a very meaningful step forward. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What things do you wish the Biden administration would tackle?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Reynoso:<strong> </strong>I think the messaging is off when it comes to inflation. In other words, I don’t think the administration has been very strong or upfront about how inflation is going to be for the next couple of years. I think we just need more honesty there. And immigration is a perennial issue for the party that seems to always get ignored.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gonzalez: My biggest complaint with Biden is that I don’t feel like he is in step with the modern political climate. Biden ran on this centrist platform that was reflective of his years in the Senate when there was more working across the aisle. But I don’t think that’s the climate these days. A lot of Republicans have really caught wind of that, and that’s how they’re operating. So we have a Republican side that’s energized, who sees politics as a zero-sum game, and then you have the leader of the Democratic Party, Biden, who I think is still operating under this old way of politics and doing things. I also wish the Biden administration would make real strides with climate change, LGBTQ+ rights and health care. These are things that probably have to pass along party lines and I don’t know if Biden could get Democrats in line to make those things happen or has the desire to make a number of executive orders.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gaines: I really think Biden needs to work a lot harder on making sure everyone has access to safe abortions. This is an issue that is immediately affecting people, and I don’t think he has a grasp of how big the impact of overturning Roe is.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What would you like to see change about the Democratic Party, if anything?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gonzalez:<strong> </strong>I’d like to see some younger leaders. On both sides, at least for the last couple of years, it has been older people running, and we’re back to the same old, white guys. It’s looking like that for 2024, unfortunately, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lim:<strong> </strong>I wish mainstream Democrats weren’t as hostile toward more progressive candidates. I was a supporter of [Vermont Sen. Bernie] Sanders for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, and to see Democrats and the Democratic National Committee ganging up on him to get him out of the primary was disappointing. A lot of younger Democrats have more progressive views, and we’re getting tired of being ignored or being told that our views are a pipe dream. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What would it take for you to vote for a Republican? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Reynoso: It would have to shed what I consider to be really toxic elements of the party. If they were to start giving up some of these radical conservative ideals and began pivoting toward appeals to Black and Latino voters and issues that impact our communities, then I think I would be more open to voting Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sharma: There’s two scenarios: The first is if I move to a place where a Republican is guaranteed to win, like Wyoming. If I lived there now, for example, I would have registered as a Republican to vote for outgoing Rep. Liz Cheney. The second scenario is if New York has a gubernatorial election and the Democratic candidate is former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whom I personally dislike. If the Democratic candidate was Cuomo — or someone like him — and the Republican candidate was a liberal like, say, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, or Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, then I would strongly consider voting for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taylor:<strong> </strong>I would never, sorry. I am firm in my belief that today’s Republican Party is an existential threat to democracy and life on this planet.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lim: I can appreciate the libertarian side of conservative politics, so they would have adhere to more of those values and beliefs versus what the party has become today. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What would it take for you to not vote at all?</strong> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gonzalez<strong>: </strong>To be completely frank, I didn’t vote in the Missouri primaries for the first time in a long time because I was just so apathetic. And I’m not very enthusiastic about voting this November, either. For the most part, though, I think I’ll always try to vote because it’s an important right and that we shouldn’t take that right for granted.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lim<strong>:</strong> I’ve always considered voting important, and it would take a lot to really make me abandon everything, but Democrats would have to move further right in order for me to completely give up on them. But, even in the worst case scenario, I would still show up to vote for local offices, I would just give up hope on a federal level. As of right now, though, I’m still voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sharma: I made a pledge to myself that I’m always going to vote — even if I’m not feeling up to it. Elections have consequences, even if they don’t happen right away. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taylor: It is my duty as an American to vote according to my conscience and to do what I think is best for my country. I have definitely been disillusioned by failures of Democratic leadership and haven’t organized much for the midterms, but I still donate to Democratic candidates I believe in and cannot imagine a situation in which I wouldn’t vote — unless I was in the hospital or dead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What concerns you most about the current state of our country? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Reynoso: We are living in a country where there’s the “haves” and the “have-nots,” and the gap is growing rapidly. I got very lucky in my career, even though I don’t have a college degree, but I have friends with kids who have to get second jobs because the cost of living is so high. And I think that there are people who are having to make a choice between work or day care, and the inequalities in our society are becoming more and more apparent. Eventually, I think we’re going to hit a breaking point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sharma: The current state of the Republican Party and its embrace of Trump. You have a lot of racism and extremism that exists within that party, and we saw that boil over with the “great replacement” theory and the shooting that happened in Buffalo, New York, which was horrible. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taylor: The extreme divisiveness. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What would your ideal political party look like?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sharma: My perfect party would be center-left and would embrace the idea of using the federal government to improve people’s lives. It would also reject taking money from wealthy corporations and seek to build an understanding of voters. As far as issues go, it would be heavily focused on improving the health care system and racial justice, but maybe not on some of the terms that a lot of people like to cry ‘woke’ about. Instead, it would focus more on things like improving Black women’s maternal mortality rate and dealing with environmental racism. I would also make sure that a woman’s right to choose is codified into law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lim: As far as issues go, we’d focus on climate change, abortion access and expanding rights for LGBTQ+ Americans. My ideal party would generally be more progressive in terms of how government spending is used, too. I would love to use the money currently spent on wars and military equipment to instead fund better infrastructure and generally just improve the world we live in. In modern American politics, the closest thing I’ve seen to a politician who I’d love to lead a party like this would be Sanders, though he is getting old. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taylor: I would love to see an Oprah president and a Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson vice president. People who reflect the beautifully diverse reality of our electorate, as well as the best of what innovative communicators and resilient entrepreneurs can achieve in America. And I want to see them shaking hands, interacting with their constituents regularly, really listening and showing they care. That kind of quality connection is missing from today’s Democratic leadership. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But those two are so wealthy and successful that I’m not sure they would want to take on the stress and chaos that is working as an elected representative in this country. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats are feeling pretty buoyant these days. Last week, they won a highly competitive special election in New York’s 19th Congressional District, which came on the heels of other <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stronger-than-expected special election performances</a> since the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-overturns-roe-wade-landmark-case-abortion/story?id=85160781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court’s June 24 decision</a> to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion. And earlier this month, pro-abortion rights forces <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-is-becoming-a-winning-issue-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned back</a> a state constitutional amendment in Kansas that would have allowed for an abortion ban there. Finally, the two parties are also running neck and neck <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in generic ballot polling</a>, which asks voters whether they plan to vote for the Democratic candidate or the Republican candidate this fall, after Republicans led by about 2 percentage points prior to the Dobbs ruling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet if we zero in on the House, the overall terrain is still quite favorable to the GOP. After all, FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 midterm election forecast</a> still gives Republicans about a better than 3 in 4 shot of capturing the lower chamber.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deluxe version, as of 5 p.m. Eastern on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> </p>

<img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-house-change-711-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-house-change-711-2.png"></div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The GOP has lost ground in the forecast since June, but its continued edge comes down to factors such as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geography</a> (Democrats are <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/vrdi/files/2018/06/Chen-Rodden-unintentional.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concentrated</a> in metropolitan areas), <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a> (Republicans once again have more favorable seats) and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history</a> (the president’s party almost always loses House seats in midterms). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s one more factor that could really help Republicans this fall: More Democrats than Republicans are leaving the House, either via retirement or to run for another office. Overall, 31 Democrats are departing, compared with just 18 Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These calculations include Rep. Ted Deutch, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/politics/ted-deutch-retiring-congressman-florida/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;who announced his retirement in February&lt;/a&gt; but also his intention to resign this fall, which will be too late to hold a pre-November special election for his seat. The totals do not, however, include members who announced their retirements but then resigned and were replaced in special elections, such as Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas. The count also doesn’t include members who won special elections during this Congress but are not seeking a full term in November 2022, such as Republican Rep. Connie Conway of California. Finally, these totals do not include members who lost renomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>19</sup></a> To be sure, this is a <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/exit-stage-left-or-right-midterm-retirements-and-open-seats-in-the-u-s-house-from-1974-to-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common midterm trend</a> — House members from the president’s party tend to leave Congress in greater numbers because the midterms usually go poorly for their side. But Republicans need to flip just four seats to gain a majority in the House,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats have 221 seats and Republicans 214 if we assign the incumbent party to each vacant seat. However, this might change by one seat if Democrats win the special election for Alaska’s At-Large District, where votes are still being counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> and it’s possible GOP victories in seats left behind by outgoing Democrats will account for at least that many. The table below lays out the most competitive districts that these Democrats and Republicans won’t be contesting. </p>

 <p>The partisan lean is based on the district maps that will be used in the 2022 election, with outgoing representatives assigned to the seat that they most likely would have run in had they sought reelection. Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Not every House departure gives Republicans a leg up, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most districts are relatively safe for one party</a>, which you can see at the end of this article where we present the data for all 49 outgoing members. However, if we look at the most competitive districts that are up for election — defined as having partisan leans between D+15 and R+15<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> — we can clearly see that Democrats were more likely to have abandoned these seats than Republicans. In total, 13 Democrats left these kinds of seats versus just five Republicans, which means more Democratic-held seats are now in danger. Incumbency <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/681670?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t nearly as strong</a> of an electoral boon as it was in the past, but it’s still likely that Democratic incumbents would have outperformed a replacement-level nominee from their party.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assigning outgoing representatives to the seat they most likely would have run in was straightforward in most cases, but a few members’ districts were significantly altered in redistricting; this is especially true in districts that aren’t that competitive. For instance, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan’s seat became considerably redder in Ohio’s map, with his old 13th District divided fairly evenly among three seats in Ohio’s new map. In such cases as these, we assigned representatives to the new district that had the largest share of the population from their old district, so Ryan was assigned to the new 14th District, where 39 percent of his current constituents live. You can see a table of all the representatives departing Congress at the end of the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To put this into context, I looked back at the terrain in 2018, when Democrats won 40 seats to take back the House <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amid a strongly pro-Democratic environment</a>. That year, far more Republicans (39) than Democrats (18) retired or sought another office; however, there wasn’t quite the same pattern in Republicans vacating competitive turf — Republicans left 14 seats open with a partisan lean between D+15 and R+15, while Democrats left 10. But thanks to the especially strong environment for Democrats, who won the House popular vote by almost 9 percentage points, Democrats captured 11 of those 14 formerly Republican seats while losing just two of the other 10.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Compared with 2018, though, the 2022 generic ballot polling points to a far more competitive environment, which means Republicans can’t count on sweeping these competitive seats. (Although, we should note that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-was-the-national-polling-environment-so-off-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the generic ballot tends to underestimate</a> Republicans.) That said, this cycle’s Democratic departures have still presented Republicans with a number of flippable seats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To name a few: Arizona’s independent redistricting commission <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted the state’s southeastern district to the right</a>, and while Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/only-11-house-members-have-said-theyre-not-running-again-heres-why-thats-important-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retired well before the map was finalized</a>, Democrats might wish she’d stuck around to defend an R+7 seat that now looks <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/arizona/6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like a good bet to go Republican</a>. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Ron Kind’s GOP-leaning 3rd District in western Wisconsin <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t change much in redistricting</a>, but Kind’s <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/04/ron-kind-derrick-van-orden-wisconsin-3rd-congressional-district-race-us-house/6130509002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close 2020 victory</a> over Republican Derrick Van Orden suggested it’d be tough to hold, and with the 13-term incumbent now retiring, Van Orden <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/wisconsin/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks favored to win the seat</a> this November. Finally, in western Illinois, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic mapmakers actually made</a> Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos’s 17th District <em>bluer</em> — it shifted from R+5 to D+4 — but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/30/cheri-bustos-announces-retirement-485109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bustos had already announced her retirement</a>, and now the seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/illinois/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is rated as a toss-up in our forecast</a> with Bustos’s 2020 opponent, Republican Esther Joy King, facing Democrat Eric Sorensen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that Democrats are also slight favorites in some competitive seats their incumbents left behind, but those districts are far from safe — especially if the environment gets better for the GOP as we get into the fall, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often happens for the out party</a> in midterm elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Failed runs for higher office by Reps. Conor Lamb (U.S. Senate) and Tom Suozzi (governor) have still left marginally Democratic-leaning seats open in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 17th District</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York’s 3rd District</a>. Meanwhile, Colorado Democratic Rep. Ed Perlmutter announced his retirement <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-28-house-democrats-arent-running-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the suburban-Denver-based 7th District</a> after the state’s independent redistricting commission <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it a D+6 seat</a>. As such, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/colorado/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s favored to remain Democratic</a>, although it is still far more competitive than it would have been under the old D+15 lines. Finally, in eastern North Carolina, Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article255896141.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left behind the state’s 1st District</a> when the GOP-controlled legislature <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/cst_13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">erased its Democratic-leaning advantage</a>, but the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court-drawn map</a> that replaced the legislature’s lines gave Democrats a bit of a reprieve, giving <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/north-carolina/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the formerly D+7 seat</a> a partisan lean of D+5.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are limits to incumbency, though, as it’s unlikely incumbency would have saved Democrats’ chances in four seats in Florida, Ohio and Tennessee, where Republican-drawn maps have probably ensured GOP wins. For instance, Reps. Charlie Crist and Stephanie Murphy’s seats <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharply shifted to the right in Florida</a>, while Rep. Tim Ryan’s seat was <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obliterated in Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Jim Cooper’s Nashville-area seat</a> swung all the way from D+17 to R+15. (As some of these districts fell outside the competitive range, you can see some of these members in the table below.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans, meanwhile, just don’t have as many departures that threaten GOP control. Just two seats in New York might cost Republicans: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/14/1073112515/republican-rep-john-katko-who-voted-for-trumps-impeachment-is-retiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. John Katko’s seat in the 22nd,</a> which has a slight Democratic lean, though Katko <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/2020s-crossover-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had prevailed under these conditions before</a>, and Rep. Lee Zeldin’s seat in the 1st District, which ultimately retained a partisan lean of R+5 and is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat favored to remain in GOP hands</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, we’re not talking about a <em>huge</em> number of seats affected by departures this year, but every seat counts in a political universe with fewer swing seats and more dark-blue and dark-red turf. Moreover, the disproportionate number of Democratic departures and the fact that many have come in potentially competitive seats could give the GOP a boost in November. Republicans only need to flip four seats to gain the barest of majorities, so anything that bolsters their chances is meaningful.</p>

 <p>The partisan lean is based on the district maps that will be used in the 2022 election, with outgoing representatives assigned to the seat that they most likely would have run in had they sought reelection. Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When Kansas voters <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kansas-abortion-vote-recount-e874f56806a9d63b473b24580ad7ea0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this month</a> rejected a ballot initiative that would have made it easier for the state legislature to restrict or ban abortion, it was only the latest example of otherwise red-state voters backing a measure seemingly out of step with their usual politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past decade, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Minimum_wage_on_the_ballot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters in 12 states</a> have passed minimum wage increases, including states as reliably Republican as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/upshot/election-results-2014-minimum-wage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Dakota</a> and <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article221172400.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missouri</a>. <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/medicaid-expansion-ballot-measures-brewing-in-three-more-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six red states have also expanded Medicaid eligibility</a> via ballot initiative after their Republican legislatures failed to do so under the new rules created by the Affordable Care Act. And since a nationwide movement to legalize marijuana began in the late 1990s, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_marijuana_on_the_ballot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a whopping 36 states have either legalized or decriminalized medical marijuana</a>, including by ballot initiative in conservative states <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Marijuana_laws_and_ballot_measures_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Utah and Oklahoma</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the reason these measures have passed is because <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/22/most-americans-support-a-15-federal-minimum-wage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’re popular</a>. Still, in many of these cases, they were unlikely to have passed Republican-controlled state legislatures. It’s why in some states, the state legislatures are now pushing back, trying to make it harder to pass ballot measures. “We do see a direct relationship between progressive measures passing in red states and legislators creating barriers to the ballot initiative process, or really looking to eliminate it all together,” said Corrine Rivera Fowler, the director of policy and legal advocacy at the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a progressive group that organizes to put initiatives on the ballot around the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This, in turn, perhaps raises a more fundamental question: Why do voters in these states so frequently support progressive ballot legislation while also voting for candidates who oppose these very efforts? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Arkansas, in particular, is an interesting case. One of the only states in the South <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/chart-of-the-initiative-states.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to have a ballot initiative system</a> for amending the state constitution <em>and</em> passing new state laws, it also <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Signature_requirements_for_ballot_measures_in_Arkansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a fairly low threshold</a> for getting issues onto the ballot.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mississippi had a process similar to Arkansas’s, but it was &lt;a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/05/31/mississippi-ballot-initiative-state-law-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;struck down by the courts&lt;/a&gt;. Florida, meanwhile, has a ballot initiative system for amending the state constitution, but not for passing new state laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>17</sup></a> Moreover, ballot initiatives in the state require just a simple majority to pass. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Using ballot initiatives, Arkansas voters have in the last decade <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arkansas_Issue_5,_Minimum_Wage_Increase_Initiative_(2018)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased the state’s minimum wage</a> twice and <a href="https://static.ark.org/eeuploads/arml/Arkansas_Medical_Marijuana_Amendment_of_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legalized medical marijuana</a> (the first Southern state to do so). This November, meanwhile, voters can decide whether to legalize marijuana for recreational use, although whether the votes will be counted <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/arkansas-supreme-court-orders-state-to-put-marijuana-legalization-initiative-on-ballot-but-votes-may-not-be-counted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remains in legal limbo</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Partly because of the success of these efforts, Arkansas will also vote on another ballot initiative in November: Issue 2, which has been pushed forward by the state legislature and will make ballot initiatives more difficult to pass. Ballot initiatives, whether they are for statutes or constitutional amendments, would require a 60 percent majority rather than a simple majority in order to pass. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The initiative’s sponsor, state Rep. David Ray, a Republican from a suburb of Little Rock, <a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/local-regional-news/2022-02-24/coalition-forms-to-oppose-arkansas-measure-requiring-supermajority-to-pass-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told a local NPR affiliate</a> that the state’s process that allows voters to pass laws and to amend the state constitution was too easy. “That process is fairly easy for big money or out-of-state interests to hijack because all they have to do is spend a large sum of money in a relatively short window of time and temporarily convince people that something is a good idea,” <a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/local-regional-news/2022-02-24/coalition-forms-to-oppose-arkansas-measure-requiring-supermajority-to-pass-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray said</a>. “And then viola, it’s in the constitution forever and ever.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t the first time the Arkansas state legislature has tried to change the ballot initiative process. In 2020, it referred a constitutional amendment that would increase the number of signatures required <a href="https://www.sos.arkansas.gov/uploads/elections/Issue_3_for_Website.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to get initiatives on the ballot</a>, but the amendment <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arkansas_Issue_3,_Initiative_Process_and_Legislative_Referral_Requirements_Amendment_(2020)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost 56 to 44 percent</a>. And this year, state legislatures in <a href="https://azpbs.org/horizon/2022/08/proposition-128-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a> and South Dakota, along with Arkansas, all proposed ballot initiatives that would change the ballot initiative process, either making it harder for voters to pass measures or granting the state legislature more control over the process. In Colorado, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Include_Income_Tax_Effects_in_Initiative_Ballot_Language_Measure_(2022)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ballot initiative would require fiscal impact summaries</a> to be prepared before signature gathering and displayed on petitions, adding steps to the process. South Dakota voters <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/South_Dakota_Constitutional_Amendment_C,_60%25_Vote_Requirement_for_Ballot_Measures_Increasing_Taxes_or_Appropriating_%2410_Million_Measure_(June_2022)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected that effort</a> in their state’s June primary. The Arkansas measure also doesn’t seem popular: A February poll from Talk Business &amp; Politics and Hendrix College found that 53 percent of people said they’d <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2022/02/poll-marijuana-legalization-growing-in-popularity-higher-threshold-on-ballot-issues-unpopular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably or definitely vote against it</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if these measures fail, legislatures still have other methods at their disposal that could make ballot initiatives harder to pass, or to get them in front of voters in the first place. They can pass laws on their own that add new requirements around the <a href="https://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills221/hlrbillspdf/4678H.01I.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">language</a> for proposals, the rules around <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/76387?SessionId=125" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtaining the</a> <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/HB0218.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signatures</a> <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&amp;objectname=2021-SB-0308&amp;query=on" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required</a> to get initiatives on the ballot or require <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/22624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra</a> or earlier steps to the approval process. “As you see states become more single-minded, that means some states are going to try to rein in the mechanisms of control that are out there,” Craig Burnett, a political scientist at Hofstra University, said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While people <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40421585?read-now=1&amp;seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally seem to like ballot initiatives</a>, there is good evidence that voters don’t know a lot about most ballot initiatives before they reach the voting booth. Political scientists Janine Parry of the University of Arkansas, Jay Barth of Hendrix College in Arkansas and Burnett found in a 2019 paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330691258_Direct_Democracy_Educative_Effects_and_the_MisMeasurement_of_Ballot_Measure_Awareness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that only about 24 to 30 percent</a> of voters could identify a single ballot initiative before going to the polls in two election years in Arkansas, 2014 and 2016. “There’s some breakthrough with … morals issues, the things that folks have an opinion on,” Barth said. “But that’s kind of the exception rather than the rule.” That paper also argued that many of the ways political scientists have tried to measure what voters know about ballot initiatives before they go to the polls actually overestimates voter knowledge. This means the ballot initiative might not always deliver on its promises of a more engaged and informed electorate, especially if voters <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/11/6/21549654/california-ballot-initiative-proposition-direct-democracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are asked to make too many complicated decisions</a> they don’t have time to research.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most of the time, though, it doesn’t matter that voters aren’t steeped in the details of ballot initiatives. In fact, it actually might be a good thing, as it means voters aren’t relying on partisanship heuristics and other clues to make their choices. Instead, the first time many voters learn about ballot initiatives is when they see them in the voting booth, and they make their decisions then.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that ballot initiatives are often separated from politics might make these measures easier for some voters to support, too. People identify with a party for many more reasons than one issue alone, and so they’re not going to change their party affiliation or vote over something like a ballot measure. “The power of partisanship is very strong,” Barth said. “At the end of the day, [voters] can have Republicans in office who share many of their values, but they still, through the direct democracy process, can get these certain policies that they care a lot about put in place.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because voters often don’t know much about ballot initiatives before voting, they’re also not usually comparing them to candidates’ stances on those issues, either. Moreover, candidates can be incentivized to not take a stand: There might be an initiative that’s popular with the state overall but not with their base or with their district. “The average legislator, I think probably very smartly, would dodge those questions, right? They’d say, ‘Well, it’s, it’s up to the people to decide,’” Burnett said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kansas’s abortion vote is a good example of the difference between partisan incentives and voter preference. Before the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in June, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only about 10 to 15 percent of voters</a> nationwide supported the sorts of near-total bans that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/09/republicans-keep-passing-extreme-anti-abortion-bans-without-popular-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republican-led state legislatures are passing</a>. But a key component of the Republican Party’s base, white evangelicals, is <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2022/january/evangelical-abortion-views-age-gap-younger-pro-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more likely</a> to think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases than the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/13/about-six-in-ten-americans-say-abortion-should-be-legal-in-all-or-most-cases-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">population as a whole</a>, which is part of the reason the party is enacting those unpopular laws. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s why in Kansas, the group organizing voters against the recent amendment emphasized broad common ground on the issue of abortion — rather than talking about specific kinds of restrictions, which can divide <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-birth-control-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more sharply along partisan lines</a>. “I think what we did that was important was that we made it OK for people to have differing views on choice,” said Ashley All, the communications director for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, a bipartisan group that opposed amending the state constitution. “Regardless of their personal beliefs about the issue … they always came back to the fact that they believe that should be a decision that a woman can make for herself and her family.” She said Kansan voters didn’t see the issue in terms of pro-life or pro-choice, but instead as “fundamental rights to make decisions about your own body.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s also another component to this: Voters seem to like the idea of constraining the legislature instead of giving them total control over the democratic process. After all, Kansans chose to keep a previous constitutional amendment that enshrined abortion rights so that the legislature <em>couldn’t</em> pass stricter laws. Barth says another ballot initiative may test this idea in November in Arkansas. The legislature also put an initiative on the ballot that would give legislators the <a href="https://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/141076/for-these-issues-thank-your-lawmakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ability to call themselves into a special legislative session</a>, which currently, only the governor has the ability to do. This is largely in response to <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2021/04/panel-advances-proposed-constitutional-amendment-to-allow-legislature-to-call-itself-into-special-session/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the emergency measures Gov. Asa Hutchinson enacted</a> during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. “I do think it’s going to be a real test on where folks come down on how much power the legislature should have,” Barth said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what the Kansas votes, and all of these votes, might underscore is that the mood is shifting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision, at least on abortion. An Ipsos/USA Today Poll published Aug. 10 found that <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/state-level-abortion-ballots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent of respondents</a> would support their state using a ballot measure to determine abortion rights at the state level. “This is such a hot issue, and the numbers are so stable in terms of public opinion … are people going to be wanting their elected representatives to take positions on [abortion initiatives]?” Burnett said. “That, I think, is something new.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Burnett said this could be true with other similarly easy-to-understand issues that voters already have strong attitudes about, which could raise the profile of ballot initiatives more generally. Rivera Fowler says her group is working to add ballot initiatives to 2024 ballots in many states that would help bolster, rather than attack, direct democracy in those states. Additionally, while the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center doesn’t campaign for or support particular candidates, it is working with state partners to educate voters more on how these issues are linked, and that the actions candidates take, or don’t take, once they’re in office matter, too. “Voters are not connecting policy and politics,” she said. “And we need to help them understand that those two are very much related.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">After plenty of back-and-forth within the Democratic Party, President Biden announced a plan to use executive action to forgive up to $20,000 of student loan debt per person last week. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses which Americans will be impacted and how the executive action will impact politics and the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then the team debates if a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/25/upshot/female-voters-dobbs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis</a> of voter registration data showing a surge of women registering to vote after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion is a good or bad use of data. Finally, the crew analyzes why Biden’s approval rating has increased by nearly 5 percentage points since late July.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When former President Donald Trump was in the White House, he bragged on Twitter, “As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win!” And he was right: In Republican primaries in 2018 and 2020, a Trump endorsement was like a golden ticket to the general election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now that he is out of office, though, Trump’s endorsees are not winning as often as they used to — a potential concern for the ex-president as he considers another presidential campaign in 2024. But that doesn’t mean his influence in the party is waning. Rather, the decline in Trump’s endorsement win rate probably has more to do with him picking tougher fights than with voters turning their backs on him. And in absolute terms, his endorsees still win far more often than they lose. So while there are signs that Trump’s influence within the GOP is slipping, he remains a powerful figure within the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the surface, Trump’s endorsement record is almost perfect. According to data collected by FiveThirtyEight, the ex-president has endorsed 189 Republican candidates in Senate, House and gubernatorial primaries that have taken place through Aug. 23.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we are only counting candidates who had Trump’s endorsement on the day of their primary. That means we are not counting Rep. Mo Brooks, whom Trump &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/04/trump-gives-mo-brooks-complete-and-total-endorsement-in-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed for Alabama Senate&lt;/a&gt; only to later &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/03/trump-pulls-mo-brooks-endorsement-new-alabama-senate-endorsement-coming-soon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rescind his endorsement&lt;/a&gt;; Michigan state Rep. Steve Carra, whom Trump &lt;a href="https://www.sturgisjournal.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/08/donald-trump-has-endorsed-steve-carra-bid-unseat-u-s-rep-fred-upton/5762731001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed for Congress&lt;/a&gt; but who eventually &lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2022/03/after-trump-endorses-opponent-state-rep-steve-carra-drops-out-of-race-for-us-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dropped out&lt;/a&gt;; former Trump administration official Morgan Ortagus, whom Trump &lt;a href="https://www.mainstreet-nashville.com/news/trump-endorses-ortagus-to-represent-nashville-in-congress/article_d9976c4c-7ed2-11ec-940f-3bf4432ffc7e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed for Congress&lt;/a&gt; but who &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/20/morgan-ortagus-baxter-lee-robby-starbuck-removed-tennessee-republican-primary/7381732001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;did not qualify for the ballot&lt;/a&gt;; or Army veteran Sean Parnell, whom Trump &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/trump-endorses-sean-parnell-pennsylvania-senate-race-20210901.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed for Pennsylvania Senate&lt;/a&gt; but who &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/sean-parnell-custody-decision-pa-senate-2022-20211122.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suspended his campaign&lt;/a&gt; amid scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>22</sup></a> And 180 of them — 95 percent — won the Republican nomination or advanced to the general election.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Alaska’s, California’s and Washington’s all-party primaries, multiple candidates from the same party can make the November ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we shouldn’t take that statistic at face value. A lot of these endorsements were of candidates who would almost certainly win anyway — an example of Trump padding his win rate to exaggerate his clout. For instance, 61 of the candidates Trump endorsed faced no opposition, and another 84 were incumbents, who rarely lose their primaries. In fact, only one Trump-endorsed incumbent lost: Rep. Madison Cawthorn. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/latest-trump-investigations-impact-midterms-88771394</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">That means of Trump’s 189 endorsements, just 44 were of nonincumbents in contested primaries — the riskiest kind of endorsements to make.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt;, we found that 45 percent of Trump’s endorsements at that point fell into this “risky” category, a significantly higher share than in 2020. However, as the primary season unfolded, Trump &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-than-70-percent-of-trumps-endorsees-believe-the-2020-election-was-fraudulent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;loaded up&lt;/a&gt; on incumbent and uncontested endorsements, and now these “risky” endorsements constitute just 23 percent of the total. That’s basically identical to the 2020 cycle (22 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>24</sup></a> And only 36 of these candidates won — giving Trump a lower win rate of 82 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">An 82 percent win rate would be the envy of most endorsers, but for Trump, it’s a bit of a letdown. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2020</a>, those same types of candidates won 96 percent of their races (24 out of 25), and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-looked-at-hundreds-of-endorsements-heres-who-republicans-are-listening-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2018</a>, his win rate among this group was 89 percent (17 out of 19).<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the win rates in the linked articles are slightly different. The 2020 article was published before the end of primary season, and the 2018 article did not include races in which Trump endorsed against an incumbent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One big reason for this decrease is that Trump took a different endorsement strategy this year: He actively tried <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to defeat many sitting governors and members of Congress</a>, who of course are very difficult to beat. In total, Trump endorsed 10 nonincumbents who were running against incumbents,<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including his former aide Max Miller, whom redistricting put in the same district as Rep. Bob Gibbs. Gibbs ended up &lt;a href="https://www.cantonrep.com/story/news/2022/04/06/congressman-bob-gibbs-retire/9482327002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;withdrawing from the race&lt;/a&gt;, but his name was still on the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>26</sup></a> and just six of them won or advanced to the general election — a 60 percent win rate that goes a long way toward explaining Trump’s lower overall win rate in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, more of these bets paid off than didn’t, and notably, Trump used these endorsements to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-than-70-percent-of-trumps-endorsees-believe-the-2020-election-was-fraudulent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reshape the party in his image</a>. In total, six of the incumbents he targeted for defeat supported the effort to impeach him for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and only two of them survived: Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because of Alaska’s new top-four primary system, Trump’s endorsee &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; advanced to the general election. This race won’t truly be resolved until November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Trump embarked on a crusade this year to rid the party of his critics, and it was largely successful. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s win rate in incumbent-less contested primaries (30 out of 34, or 88 percent) was also lower than in 2020 (96 percent), but it wasn’t unprecedented; he had the same win rate in these types of primaries in 2018. This may have been because Trump endorsed some pretty flawed candidates this cycle, too. Three of the four losers in this category faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Eight women accused business owner Charles Herbster (who ran for Nebraska governor) of <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/14/gop-state-senator-seven-other-women-say-charles-herbster-groped-them-he-denies-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwanted sexual advances</a>. Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (who ran for Senate) allegedly <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/woman-testifies-that-greitens-groped-and-hit-her-governor-blasts-lies-and-tabloid-trash/article_23265ac0-6cfe-597e-9b62-92df8d0b1e62.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit, groped and blackmailed</a> a woman he was having an affair with, in addition to allegedly coercing her to perform oral sex.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article263965801.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed two candidates&lt;/a&gt; in this race, so he was guaranteed to notch a loss regardless. He endorsed “ERIC,” which was &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/02/lobbying-trumps-missouri-endorsement-00049183" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;designed to cover&lt;/a&gt; both Greitens and state Attorney General Eric Schmitt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>28</sup></a> And former state Rep. Vernon Jones (who ran for Georgia’s 10th District) was <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/rape-allegation-shadows-vernon-jones/85-4efb1016-2350-48bf-9a9c-69a87003e465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused of rape</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of these failed endorsements also suggest (surely to Trump’s chagrin) that, when the Republican establishment decides to go toe-to-toe with him, the establishment sometimes wins. In the Nebraska gubernatorial primary, the state’s outgoing governor <a href="https://www.wowt.com/2022/01/18/gov-ricketts-endorses-jim-pillen-nebraska-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, who wound up defeating Herbster. And in the Missouri Senate race, major Republican donors and allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/02/eric-greitens-attempted-comeback-00049388" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent millions of dollars</a> to stop Greitens. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, several of Trump’s losses in this category were limited to Georgia, a particularly brutal state for Trump this cycle. Republicans there rejected not only Jones but also attorney Jake Evans (who ran in the 6th District) and former Sen. David Perdue (who ran for governor against incumbent Brian Kemp). Notably, Trump’s endorsees for <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-attorney-general-chris-carr-jen-jordan-headed-for-november-showdown/HMFS42LPQJF2DDIAF43BMNKLRA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general</a>, <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/05/25/raffensperger-declares-victory-over-election-denialism-in-georgia-gop-secretary-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secretary of state</a> and <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2022/05/26/669359.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurance commissioner</a> also lost in Georgia, but those last three don’t show up in our numbers since we don’t track down-ballot races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, Trump’s endorsement has not been a silver bullet. Other factors, such as incumbency or candidate weakness, sometimes overcame it. But it’s also important to remember that these losses are exceptions to the rule; his endorsement still carries a lot of weight. For instance, we said just a few paragraphs ago that a 60 percent win rate against incumbents was low — and for Trump, it is — but it’s also remarkably high when you consider that incumbents historically win renomination <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95 percent of the time</a> or more!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider, too, how many candidates probably wouldn’t have won without Trump’s endorsement. It’s difficult to quantify exactly how many votes Trump’s endorsement is worth, but take someone like author J.D. Vance. He was languishing in <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TRF-OH-22-Sen-GOP-Primary-0414-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second</a>, <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/OH-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-March-2-6_release-March-8-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third</a> or even <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcACaputo/status/1514671343052242951?s=20&amp;t=pGEtbZjhrIZ_2n8JjRRrtA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fifth</a> place in the GOP primary for Ohio Senate until Trump <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/04/donald-trump-endorses-jd-vance-in-ohios-crowded-republican-us-senate-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a>. Then he led in almost <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/OH-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-April-20-24_release-April-26-....pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every</a> <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TRF-OH-Sen-GOP-0501-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public</a> <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/ohio-2022-poll-trump-endorsement-boosts-jd-vance-in-four-way-ohio-senate-race-governor-dewine-holds-lead-for-republican-nomination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> of the race — and eventually triumphed over a divided field, with 32 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, former TV anchor Kari Lake was a conspiracy theorist who had never run for office before, but with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/07/trump-gop-kari-lake-00050215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump in her corner</a>, she won the Republican nomination for Arizona governor over a candidate backed by much of the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/18/mike-pence-endorses-karrin-taylor-robson-arizona-governor/10083790002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP</a> <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/blog/ducey-endorses-karrin-taylor-robson-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establishment</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also in Arizona, venture capitalist and Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters had led only in polls sponsored by his supporters, but after Trump endorsed him in June, he led in <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TRF-AZ-GOP-0612-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ArizonaResults.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successive</a> <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/az-gop-senate-race-masters-of-his-own-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> and eventually won with 40 percent of the vote. In the primary for Wisconsin governor, meanwhile, business owner Tim Michels <a href="https://captimes.com/news/government/republican-tim-michels-launches-campaign-for-wisconsin-governor/article_52ea3fe6-045b-5071-a628-0861e6d823b6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the race late</a> and won — erasing what had been a <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MLSP69Toplines.html#Q40a:_Rep_primary_for_Gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide lead</a> for former Lt.

And finally, Trump’s pick for Pennsylvania Senate, celebrity physician Mehmet Oz, also won his primary by just 953 votes; considering all of Oz’s baggage as a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/does-dr-oz-live-in-pennsylvania-20211202.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey transplant</a> who once held <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-conservative-policy-pa-senate-race-20220419.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberal views on abortion and guns</a>, it seems very likely that he owes his win to Trump as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, some candidates who were probably already on their way to winning appeared to receive a nice boost in support after Trump endorsed them. State Sen. Doug Mastriano held only about a <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TRF-PA-GOP-Gov-Primary-0508-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-percentage-point lead</a> in <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2022/Toplines-PaGOPPrimary-SPR-May2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> of the GOP primary for Pennsylvania governor, but after Trump <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/05/14/doug-mastriano-donald-trump-pennsylvania-state-senate-governor-election-primary-republican/stories/202205140042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a> the weekend before the primary, Mastriano seemed to experience a surge in support, winning by more than 23 points. Similarly, <a href="https://mirs-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/4723-MI%20GOP%20GOV%20PRESS%20RELEASE-FIELD%20COPY-%20CROSSTABS%207-26-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent</a> <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MI-Gov-GOP-0728-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> of the Michigan gubernatorial primary taken just before Trump <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/29/trump-endorses-tudor-dixon-michigan-governor/10115243002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> TV commentator Tudor Dixon gave her only single-digit leads over her opponents, but a few days later, she won the primary by 18 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even some candidates who didn’t face serious competition benefited from Trump’s support in the <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/invisible-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invisible primary</a>, demonstrating his influence among GOP elites as well. For example, Trump’s very first endorsement of the cycle was of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, one of his former press secretaries, for Arkansas governor. At the time of his endorsement, there were two high-ranking Arkansas officeholders — Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge — in that race, but they eventually <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2021/02/griffin-to-exit-governors-race-will-seek-ag-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> and <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/nov/09/leslie-rutledge-drops-out-arkansas-governors-race-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared the field</a> for Sanders. Likewise, Trump’s support for former football player Herschel Walker for Senate in Georgia probably prevented stronger candidates, like <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2021/08/25/herschel-walker-running-for-senate-rep-buddy-carter-donald-trump-endorsement-raphael-warnock-georgia/5586553001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Buddy Carter</a>, from entering the race (in fact, Walker, who until recently lived in Texas, may not have run at all without <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/03/10/donald-trump-urges-herschel-walker-to-enter-georgia-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s urging</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So if you were hoping that Trump’s 2022 endorsement record would give you a definitive answer about whether his grip on the GOP has weakened since leaving office, you’re out of luck. The best we can say is that it’s clear that his endorsement is often still pretty powerful — but it’s not invincible either. And that’s probably a good way to think about Trump’s future in the party, too. Polls show that he remains <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely popular</a> among the GOP base — but that a healthy slice of the party is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/us/politics/trump-approval-polling-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready to move on from him</a> with regard to 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, regardless of how far Republican voters are willing to follow Trump, it’s clear that they continue to crave the populist, illiberal ethos he represents. Consider that when his endorsed candidates did lose their primaries this year, it usually wasn’t to the anti-Trump wing of the party; it was to candidates who also embraced Trump even though he didn’t embrace them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The candidates who defeated Evans and Jones in Georgia, for instance, were still firm believers in Trump’s baseless claims that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-120-republicans-who-deny-the-2020-election-results-will-be-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a>. Meanwhile, even though Trump backed a challenger against him, Idaho Gov. Brad Little still <a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2020/12/11/gov-little-joins-with-idaho-gop-in-supporting-texas-lawsuit-on-election-integrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported a lawsuit</a> to overturn the election. And Rep. Nancy Mace, a <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/newsmaker-scs-nancy-mace-speaks-out-about-jan-6-and-her-former-boss-donald-trump/article_0134c7f8-61ce-11ec-8f9a-c317e9d5151b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vocal critic of Trump’s actions on Jan. 6</a>, backtracked from that stance, releasing a <a href="https://m.facebook.com/nancyrmace/videos/im-standing-in-front-of-trump-tower-with-a-message-this-morningsc01-lowcountryfi/1054561101770084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fawning video in front of Trump Tower</a> during her primary. Even Kemp, who accepted the 2020 election’s legitimacy, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/kemp-counters-perdues-pro-trump-message-with-more-trump/4BRHOROHRJE5HJWQF4Y6XFRB34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired ads</a> that tapped into Trump’s “America First” nationalism. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, even if Trump’s personal influence on the GOP is waning, Trump<em>ism</em> is definitely here to stay.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Recently, an image that listed books banned in Florida libraries and schools began making the rounds on Twitter. The <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/florida-book-bans-schools-libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 titles</a>, spanning classics from “To Kill a Mockingbird” to “A Wrinkle in Time,” caught the eyes of many, including <a href="https://twitter.com/rweingarten/status/1561516929826918402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Randi Weingarten</a>, who is president of the American Federation of Teachers, a major teacher’s labor union in the U.S. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Only one problem: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-florida-schools-to-kill-a-mockingbird-201081596097" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The list was fake</a>. There is no banned-book list at the state level in Florida.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t to say that books haven’t been banned in Florida public schools. Earlier this year, the nonprofit organization <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-florida-texas-orlando-ron-desantis-282b16bfe9771d31786b670fdecd306c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PEN America</a> reported that between July 2021 and March 2022, they’d found over 200 instances of book banning across seven Florida school districts. It’s just that these bans usually don’t include books like “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Rather, many of the books that banned in some districts in Florida — and elsewhere — are books that tackle <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/librarians-uniting-battle-school-book-ban-laws/story?id=83678096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race, gender identity and sexual orientation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lately, Republican-controlled states like Florida have experienced increased efforts to ban books that touch on these issues. In <a href="https://www.ala.org/news/sites/ala.org.news/files/content/State-of-Americas-Libraries-2020-web-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>, the American Library Association tracked 377 challenges to materials in schools, libraries and universities, and in <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/banned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021</a>, the ALA tracked 729 — an increase of over 90 percent. And as we head into a new academic year, some students are already attending schools where their reading options are now more restricted. In <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/18/1117708153/bible-anne-frank-books-banned-texas-school-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keller, Texas</a>, for example, over 40 books have been banned this year, including a graphic-novel adaptation of “The Diary of Anne Frank” as well as multiple texts with LGBTQ characters. And in some parts of the country, there aren’t book bans, per se, but <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/central-bucks-schools-book-ban-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community members can challenge any book</a> taught in schools that they find to be inappropriate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet polls suggest that most Americans aren’t on board with banning books, not even those on controversial topics. In February, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/book-bans-opinion-poll-2022-02-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a CBS News/YouGov poll</a> found that 87 percent of Americans opposed bans on books that discuss race, and the same share opposed bans on books depicting slavery. This aligns with two other polls from this year: A <a href="https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Harris-March-2022-topline-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UChicago Harris/AP-NORC survey</a> from March found that only 12 percent of Americans supported schools banning books that concern “divisive topics,” and <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/voters-oppose-book-bans-libraries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a March poll</a> by Hart Research Associates/North Star Opinion Research, on behalf of the ALA, found that 71 percent of voters opposed efforts to remove books from public libraries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the ALA poll found little difference between Republicans (70 percent) and Democrats (75 percent) on the issue. Similarly, that CBS News/YouGov poll found that Americans on both sides of the political aisle were opposed to banning books, although it also found stark differences when it came to how issues of race should be taught in the classroom, and it’s this divide that has muddied the banned-book debate currently raging in schools.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, even though <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-anti-critical-race-theory-bills-are-taking-aim-at-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there isn’t evidence</a> that critical race theory, an academic <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal framework</a> asserting that racism is systemic and embedded in many American institutions, is being taught in classrooms across the U.S., many parents are worried that it is being taught thanks to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/critical-race-theory-thrust-spotlight-misinformation/story?id=82443791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican politicians’ and conservatives’ messaging on the topic</a>. And as that CBS/YouGov poll found, Republicans have a very negative view of critical race theory, with 86 percent viewing it unfavorably, compared with 81 percent of Democrats who viewed it favorably. Moreover, in <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/23/republicans-democrats-disagree-school-problems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a YouGov poll</a> published this week, Americans were asked how concerned they were about 17 different issues facing their local schools, and Republicans said they were most concerned that students were being “indoctrinated with liberal ideas” (62 percent), while Democrats said they were most concerned about book bans (57 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the partisan differences over education in public schools, it isn’t currently a top issue for many voters in this year’s midterms. Earlier this month, the Pew Research Center asked registered voters about the importance of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/23/midterm-election-preferences-voter-engagement-views-of-campaign-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 issues</a> to their vote this fall, and while 58 percent did consider education “very important,” that result was clustered among a few others like gun policy (62 percent), voting policies (59 percent) and Supreme Court appointments (58 percent). The No. 1 issue was the economy, with 77 percent saying it was very important to their vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, education may not be the top priority that Americans expect to influence their vote this November, but it remains a controversial topic. And if the overwhelming unpopularity of book bans is any measure, the issue could still influence how voters make their decisions. </p>



<h2>Other polling bites </h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/24/744c1/3">A YouGov poll</a> conducted Aug. 24 found that over half of Americans “strongly” (37 percent) or “somewhat strongly” supported (20 percent) President Biden’s recent decision to forgive $10,000 of student loan debt for Americans earning less than $125,000. Support rose to 80 percent among Democrats, while only 35 percent of Republicans supported the decision. Opinions were also skewed heavily by age, with 30- to 44-year-old Americans voicing the most support (66 percent) and those over 65 most likely to oppose the news. </li><li>When it comes to eating out and how Americans get their groceries, concerns about the pandemic largely seem to have abated. Dining out is on the rebound, with 83 percent saying they now eat at restaurants once a month or more, compared to 87 percent in 2019 and 74 percent in 2021, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/397706/person-grocery-shopping-rebounds-online.aspx">according to a July 5-26 Gallup survey</a>. Meanwhile, almost all Americans also said they shop for groceries in person at least weekly (82 percent) or monthly (15 percent). That’s comparable to pre-pandemic data, although the coronavirus does seem to have changed at least some Americans’ grocery habits for good: Twenty-eight percent now say they now order groceries online at least once a month, up slightly from last year (23 percent) and considerably from 2019 (11 percent).</li><li>Following Kansas’s referendum on abortion earlier this month, a <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/three-in-five-americans-and-independents-are-pro-choice-following-the-recent-referendum-in-kansas/">Navigator Research poll</a> found that a clear majority (60 percent) of Americans self-identified as “pro-choice,” while only about a third identified as “pro-life.” Notably, there’s a distinct divide among racial groups, though, with a lower share of white Americans (57 percent) who were pro-abortion-rights compared to Black Americans (65 percent), Hispanic Americans (66 percent) and Asian American/Pacific Islander Americans (68 percent). And unsurprisingly, there continue to be party divides, although gender is also a significant factor among independents. Asked where they’d stand if a similar referendum took place in their own state, Democratic men (87 percent), Democratic women (85 percent) and independent women (75 percent) were far more likely to say they’d vote in favor of protecting abortion rights than independent men (48 percent), Republican women (40 percent) and Republican men (35 percent). </li><li>While <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/05/reality-tv-the-circle-netflix/">a Morning Consult analysis from last year</a> suggested reality TV is increasing in popularity, recent data from YouGov found a split in whether Americans prefer watching it or potentially starring in it. Only about a fifth said they’d be very (10 percent) or somewhat interested (11 percent) <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/19/723e1/1">in appearing on a dating reality show</a>, as opposed to 62 percent who were not interested at all. Those numbers tick up a little in the context of <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/19/723e1/2">a makeover reality show</a>: Thirty-two percent said they’d be very or somewhat interested versus 49 percent who voiced no interest at all. And <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/19/723e1/3">enthusiasm trends upward even more for home-renovation reality shows</a>, with half of Americans saying they’d be interested in participating and only 34 percent reporting no interest at all. So much for Bachelor Nation. </li></ul><h2>Biden approval</h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the days leading up to the Arizona Republican primary for governor, candidate Kari Lake warned that something was going very wrong. “We’re already detecting some stealing going on,” Lake <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/26/arizona-governor-candidate-kari-lake-already-claims-fraud-election-primary/10159862002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said at a campaign stop</a> the week before the election. Hours before the polls closed, <a href="https://www.wral.com/kari-lake-will-win-gop-nomination-for-arizona-governor-cnn-projects/20404186/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she hadn’t changed her tune</a>. “If we don’t win, there’s some cheating going on. And we already know that.” But when the race was over, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kari-lake-projected-winner-arizona-governor-republican-primary/story?id=87949812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake was the new</a> Republican nominee for governor in Arizona. This created a bit of a logical pickle for Lake: How did she win an election that was rigged?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We out-voted the fraud,” Lake <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/08/03/kari-lake-declares-victory-in-the-republican-governors-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said at a press conference</a> the next day, adding that her campaign had evidence of fraud that she would not detail with the media, but would give to “the authorities.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lake is not the only candidate this primary season who has had to figure out how to — or whether to — unring fraud’s bell. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-120-republicans-who-deny-the-2020-election-results-will-be-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some candidates</a> have stayed in the safe space of just saying 2020 was rigged. Others have claimed their own race as suspect. Either way, the risks are clear: Every time a candidate says the system is rigged, their supporters are more likely to become convinced the system is rigged. And victory doesn’t always end the candidate’s claims: Many keep at it, win or lose.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not only smaller races where it’s happening. It’s happening in races of all sizes,” said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and public policy institute. “Part of what’s concerning about it is how widespread this tactic has become.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By my count, at least a dozen primary candidates have lost their election and then immediately cried fraud. Tina Peters, who ran in the GOP primary for secretary of state in Colorado (and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-when-an-election-official-believes-the-big-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a long history</a> with election denialism), <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tina-peters-blames-election-fraud-finishing-3rd-colorado-primary-1720206" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed fraud after her third-place</a> finish, saying, “We didn’t lose. We just found out more fraud.” Two candidates for the Republican primaries for Senate and governor in Michigan <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/03/ryan-kelley-4th-place-makes-dubious-claim-says-not-conceding/10222781002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made similar claims</a> after losing by wide margins. Joey Gilbert, a candidate for the Republican governor’s race in Nevada, <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/joey-gilbert-requests-statewide-recount-after-losing-gop-governor-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called for a recount</a> after losing the race to Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo by about 26,000 votes, citing “disingenuous activity” and claiming that he, in fact, won.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Georgia, Republican candidate for governor Kandiss Taylor ended up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/24/us/elections/results-georgia.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-elections-2022&amp;region=BOTTOM_NAV&amp;context=election_recirc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing the primary by 70 points</a>, coming in third with less than 4 percent of the vote behind incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp and Trump-endorsed former Sen. David Perdue. Yet Taylor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g07ItvGZGdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has refused to concede</a>. She is suspicious of the election machines used in Georgia (both ballot marking devices and tabulators), says the election was “rigged” against her and has demanded a hand recount of all of the ballots. But she also told FiveThirtyEight that she doesn’t know if a recount would change the results.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I have no idea. We don’t know,” she said. “It’s not really, for me, about turning over the election. It’s more about the machines going away and us having checks and balances.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A similar sentiment has been shared by a slate of GOP primary election losers in Kentucky, <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/17/kentucky-elections-board-certifies-winners-for-ballot-in-recount-races/65400161007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six of whom have pursued recounts</a> even when losing by large margins. The candidates have not made explicit claims of fraud and instead say their goal is simply to “check the tech” and verify the results. But Michael Adams, Kentucky’s secretary of state and a Republican, said that explanation is just a cover.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They’re not telling the truth. They love moving the goalposts,” Adams said, pointing to one candidate who successfully petitioned for a recount (and raised the money to pay for it), only to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/put-end-madness-kentucky-elections-173457827.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file a new complaint</a> after the recount confirmed the original results. “They love making these reasonable-sounding arguments and then they get called on it and they show their true colors.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In an interview with FiveThirtyEight, Rhonda Palazzo, one of the Kentucky candidates who sought a recount (though in a legitimately narrow race, with a difference of just 58 votes), said she wasn’t making any accusations of fraud, but also referenced the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-usa-mules/fact-check-does-2000-mules-provide-evidence-of-voter-fraud-in-the-2020-u-s-presidential-election-idUSL2N2XJ0OQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely debunked</a> conspiracy theory documentary “2000 Mules,” which claims that a network of “mules” stuffed ballot boxes around the country in 2020, using specious evidence. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But many election deniers, like Lake, are winning their elections, which presents them with more of a conundrum. When you’ve spent months complaining that the election system is rigged, what do you say when you win? For some candidates, the solution is to go mum. Doug Mastriano, the Republican nominee for governor in Pennsylvania, had <a href="https://www.witf.org/2022/06/09/how-doug-mastriano-promoted-election-lies-between-election-day-and-january-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a long history</a> of parroting Trump’s claims of a stolen election, right up until he won his primary. When he declared victory on election night, he had nothing to say about the rigged election system. And he’s not alone — <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2022-06-16/election-deniers-quiet-on-fraud-claims-after-primary-wins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republican nominees were all too happy</a> to accept the results of their own races after spending months casting doubts on the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some raised complaints of fraud even after they had won. After Jim Marchant, the Republican nominee for secretary of state in Nevada, won his race, he said he was “not really confident in the result.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Fraud is a harsh word, but there could have been anomalies — malicious or accidental — based on what I’ve heard,” Marchant <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/conservatives-win-big-in-nevada-statewide-contests-2593169/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Las Vegas Review-Journal</a>, but added that he still accepted his victory. “What am I supposed to do, not win?” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These candidates are all singing different verses of the same song, a way to continue to sow doubt in the election system while benefiting from the support of voters who believe in such claims. And <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-120-republicans-who-deny-the-2020-election-results-will-be-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given the number of election deniers who have won</a> their primaries so far, it’s likely we’ll hear an encore come November.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Jerrold Nadler won his Manhattan primary against fellow Rep. Carolyn Maloney in a walk on Tuesday. And in downtown Manhattan, the former federal prosecutor and lead counsel in Trump’s first impeachment inquiry, Dan Goldman, pulled out a victory in a crowded field. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Elsewhere in the state, Democrats overperformed in two special elections, including a win in New York’s 19th District, which is 4 percentage points more Republican than the nation, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew discusses what these results mean for the midterms this fall and where other indicators of the political environment are pointing.</p>
