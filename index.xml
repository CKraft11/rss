<p data-paragraph="main">Remember when Georgia’s runoff gave Democrats 51 seats in the U.S. Senate? Well, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema said <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1784697-lee-corsos-not-so-fast-gets-autotuned-by-espn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not so fast, my friend</a>: This morning, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2022/12/09/sen-kyrsten-sinema-of-arizona-why-im-registering-as-an-independent/69712395007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinema announced</a> she would change her party registration to independent and no longer identify as a Democrat moving forward. On paper, then, the next Senate’s makeup will be 49 Republicans, 48 Democrats and three independents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Sinema’s switch doesn’t necessarily change the Senate’s voting math. Sinema told the Arizona Republic she <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/12/09/sen-kyrsten-sinema-leaves-democratic-party-to-become-an-independent/69710762007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intends to mostly align</a> with the Democrats and keep her committee assignments from that party (which Majority Leader Chuck Schumer <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/09/krysten-sinema-independent-white-house-00073243" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed he had agreed to honor</a>). Alongside fellow independent Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, she appears set to give the party 51 seats when it comes to organizational questions, allowing them to hold majorities on committees. Considering that she may not alter her legislative habits, why did Sinema make this decision? Her reelection outlook in 2024 may help explain her move, although her centrist attitudes likely played some role.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To some, Sinema’s party switch might not come as a surprise <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kyrsten-sinema-is-confounding-her-own-party-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering her moderate reputation</a>. After all, she has the second-most conservative voting record in the Senate among Democrats,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including King and Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> according to roll-call data <a href="https://voteview.com/congress/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Voteview.com</a>, with only West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin coming in to her right. Since joining the Senate, she’s taken public stances against Democratic efforts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/13/how-kyrsten-sinema-defended-filibuster-bipartisanship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to abolish the filibuster</a> and, along with Manchin, pushed her party <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/23/sinema-35t-spending-bill-506583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to sharply reduce</a> the outlays in budgetary legislation. Her positions have infuriated many Arizona Democrats, and the state party <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/22/senator-kyrsten-sinema-censured-arizona-democratic-party-board-filibuster-vote/6620816001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formally censured her</a> over her 2022 vote to retain the filibuster, which helped block Democratic efforts to pass voting rights legislation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Sinema’s tendency to split from her party probably doesn’t explain her decision by itself. If that were the case, we might expect Manchin <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-manchin-actually-leave-the-democratic-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to have switched parties</a> as well. In <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/crossing-the-aisle/519F5A3C501380C42ABB4B1E041DC946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his study of party switchers</a> from 1950 to 2014, political scientist Antoine Yoshinaka found that a member of Congress’s voting record didn’t do a good job of predicting party switchers on its own, even though party switchers were more likely to be out of sync with their party ideologically. He found that ideological disagreement usually had to occur alongside a desire to run for higher office or to gain a more valuable committee post to produce a greater likelihood of changing parties. Sinema, however, is already in a high office as senator — a presidential bid as a centrist independent seems unlikely, though we shouldn’t rule that out — and if she votes similarly to how she has previously, it won’t be as if she made a full-on party switch to the GOP and received a plum committee assignment as part of the deal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a solid chance Sinema’s 2024 electoral outlook played into her decision-making process. Sinema <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/sinemas-decision-quit-democratic-party-jolts-arizona-2024-senate-race-rcna60947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t said</a> whether she plans to run for reelection, but there’s little question that her tendency to break with her former party has outraged much of the Democratic base that helped put her in the Senate in the first place. A <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/9_27_2022_tables.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University/Arizona Republic poll</a> of the state in September found that Democratic likely voters viewed her quite negatively, with 49 percent holding an unfavorable opinion and 30 percent a favorable one. Facing a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23323231/ruben-gallego-arizona-latino-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential primary challenge</a> on her left from Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, Sinema stood a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/1/26/poll-arizona-senator-kyrsten-sinema-set-to-be-unseated-by-possible-challenger-ruben-gallego-in-2024-primary-landslide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real chance of losing renomination</a> if she sought reelection as a Democrat (she might’ve been in trouble against a more center-left Democrat, too, like <a href="https://twitter.com/gregstantonaz/status/1601307744874921984?s=20&amp;t=Klli74t_qEhe6Oh9m0lGWg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Greg Stanton</a>). Tellingly, Yoshinaka’s study found the prospect of facing a highly competitive primary in one’s own party can play into leaving that party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, if Sinema’s chances of winning a Democratic primary were mediocre at best, it’s unclear how much stronger her path would be as an independent. It’s hard to imagine Republicans deciding not to field a major candidate against Sinema even if she’s an independent, but it’s possible she is hoping that the potential complications of a three-way race discourage a high-profile Democrat like Gallego from running. In that scenario, perhaps Democrats line up behind her in a head-to-head race against a Republican. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Gallego has already responded to Sinema’s switch <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/09/ruben-gallego-campaign-senate-kyrsten-sinema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by sending out fundraising texts</a> that say he’s considering a Senate run. Now, Sinema might be able to put together a mishmash coalition of Democrats, Republicans and independents to win a three-way contest. After all, that Suffolk poll found that Republican likely voters also had a slightly more positive view of her than Democrats (35 percent favorable, 40 percent unfavorable), while independent likely voters had net-positive attitudes (42 percent favorable, 27 percent unfavorable). And she could attract plurality support if Democrats and Republicans nominate candidates who are viewed as too far left or right. That’s a possibility, too, as Gallego is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and Arizona Republicans just nominated far-right contenders Blake Masters and Kari Lake in the 2022 Senate and gubernatorial races, respectively.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Sinema could certainly also find herself running in last place. Yoshinaka’s study found party switchers suffer an electoral penalty in their first general election after switching, with an average decline of 4 to 9 percentage points in vote share. Having upset Democrats, Sinema might lose most of their support to the Democratic pick, and there’s no guarantee that many Republicans back her over their party’s nominee, even if that candidate is highly problematic. While <a href="https://azsos.gov/elections/results-data/voter-registration-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona does have</a> 1.4 million registered voters who aren’t registered as Republicans (1.4 million voters) or Democrats (1.3 million), we also know that most self-identified independents <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-americans-who-identify-as-independent-are-actually-independent-thats-really-bad-for-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lean toward one party or the other</a>. So getting voters to eschew the major-party candidates won’t be easy, especially if Sinema isn’t overwhelmingly popular (the Suffolk poll put her overall favorability at 36 percent favorable, 38 percent unfavorable).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The difficulties Sinema is likely to encounter speak to why senators rarely switch parties, and why it’s even more unusual for them to become — and stay — independent. Sinema is just the 10th senator since 1951 to formally switch parties while in office, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/senators_changed_parties.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the U.S. Senate</a>, as the table below shows:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of this group, Sinema is the sixth to become an independent at some point, but only three prior to her actually stuck with identifying that way. Of those, Sen. Harry Byrd Jr. of Virginia might make the most interesting comparison to Sinema: A conservative Democrat, <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/byrd-harry-flood-jr-1914-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he refused to take an oath</a> saying he would back the party’s nominee for president in 1972, ahead of his 1970 reelection campaign. He instead ran as an independent, thereby avoiding a primary challenge, and <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/78732/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a majority</a> of the vote over Democratic and Republican opposition (he’d win <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/48412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 1976</a> as well, although throughout that time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/us/harry-f-byrd-virginia-senator-dies-at-98.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he still caucused with the Democrats</a>). Sinema, it seems, will be aiming to pull off the same trick in 2024 — that is, should she choose to run again. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Kevin McCarthy is the obvious candidate for the next speaker of the House. Republicans flipped the chamber in 2022, and McCarthy is already House minority leader. He has no serious rivals, and former President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/trump-endorses-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed his bid</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But McCarthy has a problem: He may not have the votes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans will start the 118th Congress with only a narrow majority in the House — just 222 seats to the Democrats’ 212.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One seat will be vacant because of the &lt;a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-rep-donald-mceachin-dies-at-61/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Democratic Rep. Donald McEachin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> And six incoming Republican representatives have already said they will not vote for McCarthy for speaker. That would leave McCarthy with 216 votes at most — two shy of a majority. And that’s just the people who have publicly announced their opposition. (Several other Republicans are ideologically similar and could oppose him, too.) So this could be the first speaker election that has gone to multiple ballots <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-Multiple-Ballots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1923</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But don’t get too excited, Democrats: This isn’t an episode of The West Wing<em> </em>where a consensus candidate could become speaker with support from Republicans and Democrats. There are still several ways this ends with a Speaker McCarthy.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few different tools we can use to categorize the political interests of members of Congress. First, there’s the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean. Partisan leans have not yet been updated with the results of the 2022 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> of their districts. Then, there’s the metric <a href="https://voteview.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DW-NOMINATE</a>, whose first dimension uses roll-call votes to place members of Congress on a spectrum from -1 (most liberal) to 1 (most conservative).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2019, <a href="https://rollcall.com/2019/01/03/here-are-the-15-democrats-who-didnt-vote-for-pelosi-as-speaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 Democrats</a> voted for someone other than Rep. Nancy Pelosi for speaker. According to these metrics, they were all ideologically moderate and hailed from competitive districts, suggesting that they voted against Pelosi because she was too liberal or it was politically disadvantageous to support her. </p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>
 <p>The first dimension of DW-NOMINATE uses voting records to quantify the ideology of every member of Congress on a scale from 1 (most conservative) to -1 (most liberal). The second dimension roughly quantifies how pro-establishment (1) or anti-establishment (-1) they are. Mike Collins does not have DW-NOMINATE scores because he was just elected in November.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But their opposition probably <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t just based on ideology</a>. The five incumbent members on this list<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they haven’t cast any roll-call votes yet, people who were just elected for the first time in 2022 don’t have DW-NOMINATE scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> have very negative scores on the <em>second</em> dimension of DW-NOMINATE, which roughly quantifies how establishment (positive numbers) or anti-establishment (negative numbers) a member of Congress is. Four of the five are also members of the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/20/house-freedom-caucus-what-is-it-and-whos-in-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Caucus</a>, essentially the governing wing of the old tea party — a very conservative group, notoriously hostile to the establishment and unwilling to compromise. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McCarthy has been a member of House GOP leadership since 2009, so it makes sense that anti-establishment Republicans are keen to oppose him. Rep. Andy Biggs, also <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/06/opinion-im-running-to-replace-kevin-mccarthy-as-house-speaker-and-break-the-establishment-rep-andy-biggs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running for speaker</a>, has practically confirmed this sentiment, <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1600160193349767169?s=20&amp;t=7LAmEaQ7ighY1l9U6MliPg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a>, “Kevin McCarthy was created by, elevated by, and maintained by the establishment.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And unfortunately for McCarthy, several more Republicans might agree with them. The next House will include 10 other Republicans who are either more conservative or anti-establishment (according to DW-NOMINATE) than at least one anti-McCarthy Republican. Three (Reps. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/midterm-elections-congress-house-results/card/marjorie-taylor-greene-backs-kevin-mccarthy-for-house-speaker-r0Gwt5eZy2QmqL9gXWnT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/15/freedom-caucus-kevin-mccarthy-house-speaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Massie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1600595462356172800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom McClintock</a>) say they intend to vote for McCarthy, but the other seven could be ripe to oppose him. For example, Rep. Chip Roy <a href="https://radio.foxnews.com/2022/12/05/congressman-chip-roy-the-need-for-new-republican-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has yet to say</a> whom he will support for speaker on the House floor. But he did <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/11/15/chip-roy-speaker-house-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominate Biggs</a> over McCarthy to be the GOP’s official nominee for speaker in a caucus meeting on Nov. 15.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And the list of McCarthy opponents could be even longer because of new Republicans who were just elected in November. FiveThirtyEight canvassed all 41 Republican freshmen, and we identified just 17 who supported McCarthy for speaker: Reps.-elect <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1600580468109361163" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Alford</a>, <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/27/missouri-election-2022-eric-burlison-7th-district-race-meets-with-gop-leaders-as-democrat-mounts-bid/69544562007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carl Burlison</a>, <a href="https://www.koin.com/nwpolitics/chavez-deremer-on-bipartisanship-measure-114-2024-presidential-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lori Chavez-DeRemer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1600520888285384711" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony D’Esposito</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1600580943491776520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russell Fry</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/WesleyHuntTX/status/1591127738836189184?s=20&amp;t=HJs1BbsAyaem4NVpD_w55A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wesley Hunt</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6315582735112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John James</a>, <a href="https://newjersey.news12.com/rnc-chair-ronna-mcdaniel-stumps-for-tom-kean-jr-in-closely-watched-congressional-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Kean Jr.</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JenKiggans/status/1594825220011220992" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jen Kiggans</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1600533632204128260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick LaLota</a>, <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/nick-langworthy-eyes-transition-from-operative-to-elected-official/article_c14b9df8-5ac2-11ed-9d17-7f980c508dac.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Langworthy</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/politics/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-house-lawler-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Lawler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1600865101250461701?s=20&amp;t=H0vTNy_4uB-U8x9ezbiXNQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laurel Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/12/kevin-mccarthy-house-speaker-bid-00056090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andy Ogles</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6316587785112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Santos</a> and <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/cny/2022/11/how-brandon-williams-defied-the-odds-again-in-race-for-central-ny-house-seat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brandon Williams</a> as well as Rep. <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1600567567076179977?s=20&amp;t=JTuYtdVclEdDzzB9R1k1Sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rudy Yakym</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Others either didn’t respond to our inquiries or said they were still making up their mind. For example, in an email, Rep.-elect Anna Paulina Luna told FiveThirtyEight, “I will vote on January 3rd for whoever allows me to best represent my constituents… I do not like to publicly disclose my private conversations with my colleagues.” And a spokesperson for Rep.-elect Josh Brecheen told us he “has not taken a decided position on speaker, but is praying and considering all information.” (Both Brecheen and Luna, by the way, were elected with help from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/02/new-class-combative-maga-candidates-poised-roil-house-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Caucus</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But all this doesn’t mean McCarthy is doomed. He may not have 218 votes right now, but there’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/02/who-could-be-speaker-if-not-kevin-mccarthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no obvious alternative</a> to him, either. So the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/do-you-buy-that-mccarthy-will-eventually-become-speaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likeliest outcome</a> may be that he wins the speakership after putting in a little elbow grease. According to Axios, McCarthy has been <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/30/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-freedom-caucus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meeting with some of his detractors</a>. And while four have told reporters that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/29/mccarthy-house-speaker-republicans-opposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nothing will change their minds</a>, the other two may be more malleable. Rep. Matt Rosendale told Puck News he would vote for McCarthy in “<a href="https://puck.news/anyone-but-mccarthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme circumstances</a>,” which means that there are <em>some</em> circumstances in which he would vote for him. Meanwhile, Rep.-elect Mike Collins pledged to vote against McCarthy in September 2021 when he <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/09/17/mike-collins-launches-10th-congressional-district-bid-in-trumps-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched his campaign</a>. His spokesperson has not responded to multiple inquiries about whether he will keep his promise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McCarthy has another reason for optimism: Technically, he doesn’t even need 218 votes to become speaker. He needs only a majority of the votes cast for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/22/house-speaker-mccarthy-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named candidate</a>. So if some members skip the vote or abstain (in House parlance, vote “present”), it would lower the number he needs to hit. Biggs, Rep. Matt Gaetz, Rep. Bob Good, Rep. Ralph Norman and Rosendale have all said <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/3757326-mccarthy-readies-for-floor-showdown-in-speakership-bid-as-opponents-dig-in-heels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they will not vote “present.”</a> Still, that could be a way for them to not oppose McCarthy without saying they changed their mind. So McCarthy could win the speakership if three of his opponents (including Democrats!) skip the vote or vote “present,” assuming every other Republican votes for him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As messy as these scenarios would be, they are still likelier than the Democratic dream scenario that some <a href="https://omaha.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/bacon-would-work-with-dems-to-elect-moderate-house-speaker-if-gops-mccarthy-falls-short/article_ecfa7c66-6491-11ed-9123-5393236e49c4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate Republicans</a> would work with Democrats to elect a compromise candidate. The last time a majority party failed to elect a speaker was 1839, when Democrats held the House majority but party infighting <a href="https://history.house.gov/Blog/2014/April/4-8-A-Mob-in-Search-of-a-Speaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led to the election</a> of Whig Rep. Robert M.T. Hunter with bipartisan support. It’s unlikely that that streak will break when the two parties are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively hostile toward each other</a> and the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">furthest apart ideologically</a> that they have been in at least 50 years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The official nominee of the party that controls the House has won <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL30857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every speaker election since at least 1913</a>, even when its majority was narrower than it is now. So it may not be smooth sailing, but Republicans will likely get their preferred speaker one way or another. Kevin McCarthy is just hoping it’s him.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">When President Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/04/briefing/railroad-workers-demands.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a bill to prevent a rail-worker strike</a> this past Friday, it was only the latest in a series of union actions that have gotten national attention in the past few years. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/02/1124680518/starbucks-union-busting-howard-schultz-nlrb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starbucks</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/02/amazon-workers-just-voted-to-join-a-union-heres-what-happens-next-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> workers are trying to unionize around the country. Nationwide, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/8/30/23326654/2022-union-charts-elections-wins-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">78,000 workers</a> went on strike in the first half of the year. Members of The New York Times Guild <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/12/08/new-york-times-walkout-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walked out on Thursday</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The National Labor Relations Board reported a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/union-election-petitions-increase-57-in-first-half-of-fiscal-year-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">57 percent increase</a> in the number of union elections in the first half of the 2022 fiscal year — Oct. 1, 2021, through March 31 this year — and unions are <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/8/30/23326654/2022-union-charts-elections-wins-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning</a> more than three quarters of their votes. And the share of Americans who support unions, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398303/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71 percent</a>, is at the highest level since 1965, according to Gallup. After a decades-long slump, organized labor is on the upswing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of this undoubtedly results from the tumult in workplaces throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. First, essential workers who couldn’t stay home <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-covid-19-hazard-continues-but-the-hazard-pay-does-not-why-americas-frontline-workers-need-a-raise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banded together to demand</a> more safety measures in the months when the virus was new and vaccines weren’t yet available. Then, as workplaces and the country began reopening, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/half-of-us-states-hit-record-low-unemployment-rates-in-2022-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unemployment plummeted</a> and has stayed low. Despite some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/layoffs-sweeping-the-us-these-are-the-companies-making-cuts-2022-5#morgan-stanley-about-1600-workers-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent mass layoffs</a>, especially in tech and journalism, the labor market is so far mostly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/02/november-jobs-report-fed-labor-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defying fears of a recession</a> and ignoring the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame it. That has put workers in a relatively powerful position, at least up to now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Workers have recently undertaken <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/reports-and-publications/labor-action-tracker-annual-report-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything from work stoppages to strikes for better pay and working conditions</a>, according to data from the IRL Worker Institute at Cornell University. The institute has seen a “noticeable uptick” in union activity this year compared with the previous year, <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/reports-and-publications/labor-action-tracker-annual-report-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Johnnie Kallas</a>, a Ph.D. candidate who is the project director of the IRL Worker Institute’s Labor Action Tracker. But it’s hard to know how that compares with the past. Because of budget cuts in the Reagan era, the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/reports-and-publications/labor-action-tracker-annual-report-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped tracking</a> all but the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/wkstp/annual-listing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest labor actions</a>. It’s also unclear if recent labor actions will translate into long-term change for workplaces, unions and the workers they represent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For most of the time since the 1930s, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398303/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority of Americans have favored labor unions</a>, but support began to decline in the 1960s, dropping from 71 percent in 1965 to 55 percent by 1979. After a slight increase, Americans’ support of unions hit a low of 48 percent in 2009. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chart-union-membership-changes-decline-over-the-years-2022-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share of private-sector workers in unions</a> also declined steadily since the 1980s. This was caused by a <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-us-labor-unions-and-why-they-still-matter-38263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multitude of political and economic factors</a> — industrial deregulation, the rise of anti-union politicians, increasing globalization — but American workplaces also fundamentally changed. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/09/03/watch-the-u-s-transition-from-a-manufacturing-economy-to-a-service-economy-in-one-gif/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Employment opportunities moved</a> from traditionally organized workplaces, like factories, into a service industry where union density was already lower. Many workers unionizing today are making coffee instead of cars, and issues like high turnover and irregular worker schedules in those industries <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00197939211048484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led to job instability</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://civicscience.com/company-responses-to-employee-unionization-strongly-influence-consumer-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Support for unions today is also divided along partisan lines</a>: Sixty-five percent of Democrats and 43 percent of independents support unions, while a plurality of Republicans (47 percent) oppose them, according to CivicScience. That being said, a majority of Americans think that <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/6/dfp_worker_union_rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether to unionize should be entirely the workers’ choice</a> and that employers should stay neutral.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And despite the partisanship, Americans largely favor the kinds of worker protections and benefits unions fight for. In general, Americans <a href="https://www.bentley.edu/files/gallup/Bentley-Gallup_Force_for_Good_Report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think businesses</a> should treat workers with respect, pay fair wages and provide health care benefits. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/22/most-americans-support-a-15-federal-minimum-wage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sixty-two percent of Americans support</a> a $15 federal minimum wage, and <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/12/01/most-americans-think-minimum-wage-is-too-low" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-quarters of Americans</a> think the current federal minimum wage, $7.25 an hour, is too low. Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2017/03/23/americans-widely-support-paid-family-and-medical-leave-but-differ-over-specific-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly support paid family and medical leave</a>, a sticking point in the rail-worker negotiations. While the pandemic led to <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/09/16/pandemic-prompts-more-states-to-mandate-paid-sick-leave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more states and cities mandating paid sick leave</a> and 79 percent of civilian workers <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/paid-sick-leave-was-available-to-79-percent-of-civilian-workers-in-march-2021.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had paid leave</a> available to them as of March 2021, the workers least likely to have it are the lowest paid. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But all of that <em>general</em> support didn’t carry over to the specific case of the rail workers and their requests for paid sick leave to be included in their contract. CivicScience found that <a href="https://civicscience.com/immediate-insights-more-than-two-thirds-of-americans-approve-of-president-bidens-decision-to-block-rail-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68 percent of Americans</a> approve of Biden blocking the rail strike. A poll from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/qsanp37uhh/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> conducted Dec. 3-6 found that 56 percent of Americans approve of government action to avoid a strike that could harm the American economy, suggesting that supply-chain concerns in the middle of the holiday shopping season might have outweighed sympathy to the rail workers’ demands. But rail workers have warned that more disgruntled employees could <a href="https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-lobbying/3762605-no-paid-sick-leave-could-spur-rail-worker-exodus-that-ripples-across-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bail on an industry that is already understaffed</a>. That has been the overall story of how workers in all kinds of industries have flexed their power in the labor market over the past few years, whether or not they personally have a union to back them up. If conditions and pay at one job <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2022/article/empirical-evidence-for-the-great-resignation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t meet workers’ expectations</a>, many have had <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/07/28/majority-of-u-s-workers-changing-jobs-are-seeing-real-wage-gains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an easier time finding a job that does</a>.</p>



<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>Americans are more likely than citizens of other countries to be wary of social media’s role in politics, according to polling conducted in 19 different nations and recently <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/12/06/social-media-seen-as-mostly-good-for-democracy-across-many-nations-but-u-s-is-a-major-outlier/">published by Pew Research Center</a>. Sixty-four percent of Americans said that social media has had a negative impact on democracy — a percentage higher than that of any other country surveyed, which ranged from 54 percent in the Netherlands down to 15 percent in Poland. Despite their concerns about social media, Americans’ usage has risen over the past ten years: Seventy-two percent of American adults use such sites today, versus just 50 percent in 2012. All in all, this is not so different from places where social media is viewed as less threatening to democracy. Sixty-six percent of Polish citizens, for example, use social media now, up from 40 percent a decade ago. (In 2012, Pew asked the social-media-usage question only of people who first reported they used the internet, whereas in 2022 that question was asked of all respondents.)</li><li>Americans were more confident that their 2022 midterm-election ballot was counted accurately than they were that their 2020 presidential-election ballot was, per Nov. 17-21 polling from <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/a-majority-of-americans-feel-uneasy-about-the-state-of-american-democracy/">Navigator Research</a>. Sixty percent of Americans believed their 2020 ballots were counted correctly and fairly, versus 71 percent who said the same about 2022. The level of confidence reported by Democrats and independents remained virtually the same across the two elections, but the same did not hold true for Republicans: While only 31 percent felt their 2020 ballot was correctly counted, nearly double (58 percent) voiced the same about their 2022 ballot.</li><li>Gun ownership in America varies widely by gender, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/406238/stark-gender-gap-gun-ownership-views-gun-laws.aspx">according to recently released Gallup polling</a>. Just 22 percent of American women reported personally owning a gun, but that rate is nearly double among men (43 percent). Men’s gun ownership levels have remained fairly consistent since 2007, according to annual surveys from Gallup, while the number among women has risen slightly from 13 percent in the organization’s first poll on the matter, conducted in 2007-2008. </li><li>A Nov. 18-22 <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/12/6/a-majority-of-voters-believe-climate-change-will-increase-costs">survey from Data For Progress</a> found that more than two-thirds of Americans (69 percent) were at least somewhat worried climate change will lead to higher consumer prices in the future. High numbers of Democrats were worried about the impact of climate change on prices (82 percent), but 56 percent of Republicans also share these concerns. That said, there’s less consensus on what to do about it. Almost half of Democrats (45 percent), for example, said that renewable energy production will bring down energy costs “a lot,” yet only 12 percent of Republicans were on the same page.</li></ul>

<p data-paragraph="main">ATLANTA — I have a confession to make. My editors tasked me with flying out to Georgia to cover the state’s Senate runoff and asked me to assess what was creating a recent (and seemingly) nonstop cycle of neck-and-neck political contests. But before I even set foot on the plane, I was skeptical that one runoff alone could serve as a crystal ball to predict the state’s political future. Runoffs are their own animal. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yes, I expected <a href="https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/voter-fatigue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voter fatigue</a> — how many runoffs can one state take? But when I landed in Georgia late last week, the state’s voters didn’t seem especially tired. <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/early-voting-in-georgia-ends-with-big-turnout-in-us-senate-runoff/R2CA5PMNYVBH3O7P4ZHSOPTD5Y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There was record early voting</a> and that remained high through Election Day: Turnout in the runoff was 89 percent of the November turnout from last month. On top of that, in-person events for both candidates were packed. “There is excitement here because we want to continue pushing policies that a lot of people, especially young people, find important — like climate change, and canceling student debt, and ensuring women’s reproductive rights,” 20-year-old Shruthi Mohana Sundaram, the president of College Democrats at Georgia Tech, told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the end, Sen. Raphael Warnock prevailed. By a slim margin of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/06/us/elections/results-georgia-us-senate-runoff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 3 percentage points</a>, the incumbent Democrat eked out a win over Republican Herschel Walker in a nail-biter election night. It was another high-profile statewide victory for Democrats, who, during the 2020 election cycle, managed to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/07/warnock-ossoff-flipped-senate-georgia-456310" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flip Georgia’s two Senate seats</a> and win <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-stacey-abrams-georgia-37715b9c1603281df2937333abe2a995" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its 16 electoral votes</a> for the first time <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/politics/joe-biden-wins-georgia/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in almost three decades</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Georgia is a magnet for political attention because the state has become a microcosm of the nation’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense political polarization</a>. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than any other state</a>, it has seen the biggest increase in its share of Black<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined throughout this article as single-race and not Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a><sup> </sup>Americans 18 years or older, and there’s been substantial Democratic growth <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/11/09/what-can-the-2022-midterms-tell-us-about-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs</a>. Mixed into the state, though, are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/abrams-warnock-courting-rural-georgia-voters-republican-terrain-2022-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older, rural, Republican voters</a>, and, arguably, all of those residents come together to personify the diversity of both the state and the nation. This melting pot effect has made the state fertile hunting ground for both political parties. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given Georgia’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/upshot/warnock-ossoff-georgia-victories.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprisingly pivotal</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-georgia-elections-bb997641ca36805c0f53f406a3529d87" target="_blank" rel="noopener">role in the 2020 election</a>, political prognosticators (including my colleagues and I) have spent a lot of time assessing what runoff results mean <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the broader political environment</a>: Is Georgia now purple (or perhaps — if you’re feeling generous to Democrats — periwinkle)? Or, is it a red state — evidenced by every other statewide Republican, save for Walker, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/06/takeaways-georgia-runoff-2022-warnock-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning their election this fall</a> — that, due to the specifics of the last two elections, <em>happens</em> to have two Democratic senators?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The truth — as it so often does in politics — lies between the two narratives. Runoffs are kooky, and Warnock’s victory tells us as much about the importance of candidate quality, turnout and campaign strength as it does about the state’s political future. The state’s hue is likely to vary depending on who’s running, how much money they have and how energized voters feel. Warnock’s second runoff victory is definitely a sign that the state is getting more competitive. Put plainly: Georgia’s statewide Republicans can’t coast here anymore. But Warnock also had some important factors (like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incumbency</a>) working in his favor, and Democrats will need both luck and skill to keep up their winning streak. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This process of becoming a competitive state is two steps forward and one step backward,” said former Gov. Roy Barnes, who held the post from 1999 to 2003 and was the last Democrat to lead the state. “And I think that Georgia is on the march toward being a state in which either side can win depending on the quality of the candidate and the financial backing they have to get their message out.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="678" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Georgia-Polling-ElectionDay-Diptych.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Georgia-Polling-ElectionDay-Diptych.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Georgia-Polling-ElectionDay-Diptych.jpg?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Georgia-Polling-ElectionDay-Diptych.jpg?w=2048 2x"><figcaption>Georgia voter Selden Deemer shared photos from his rural polling place, where the line for early voting stretched far outside the front door.</figcaption></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">I was skeptical about drawing too much of a conclusion about Georgia’s future based on the runoff results, in part because runoffs are really a relic of Georgia’s past. The state law mandating that one candidate surpass the 50 percent vote threshold on the first ballot <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anxiety/episodes/racist-history-georgia-runoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has racist roots</a> and was created as a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/tellingallamericansstories/upload/CivilRights_VotingRights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">means of preserving white political power</a> in a heavily Black state by making it harder for Black candidates to prevail. This effort to suppress the franchise of people of color continued in the lead-up to Tuesday, too: A <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-georgia-93f3ee7ff34e5d6aa2bd96d048832a8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new state law</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-score/2022/11/28/georgia-runoff-by-the-numbers-00070906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly shortened the runoff campaign period</a>, despite research showing that a shortened early voting window <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/impact-voter-suppression-communities-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adversely affects voters of color</a>. Moreover, state officials and Republican groups <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-11-23/georgia-high-court-allows-saturday-voting-for-senate-runoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to argue</a> that a section of Georgia law prohibited early voting the Saturday after Thanksgiving. (Democrats <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/win-democrats-georgia-judge-allows-early-voting-senate-runoff-saturday-rcna57983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a court challenge</a> blocking the effort). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So runoffs already carry a lot of baggage — and for years, Republicans overwhelmingly prevailed when they happened. But Georgia is getting more competitive for Democrats, in part <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to demographic changes</a>. It’s just not clear <em>how</em> competitive. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you look back through the last few election cycles, Republican governor and presidential nominees normally won with about 51 to 53 percent of the vote. That has pretty much stayed consistent,” said Kaaryn Walker, a GOP consultant in Atlanta and founder of Black Conservatives for Truth. “All that’s to say is that we are a red-purple state, we’re not one of those dark-red states where Republicans are consistently winning by double-digits.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As the chart above shows, Democrats <em>have</em> made gains in some statewide races over the past few cycles — and Republicans have found it more difficult to win. For most Senate and presidential contests that took place between 1998 and 2016, Republicans easily won their elections — oftentimes by double-digit margins.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Senate 2008 general election went to a runoff after then-incumbent Sen. Saxby Chambliss only earned 49.8 percent of the vote compared to Democrat Jim Martin’s 46.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> That changed during the 2020 cycle when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/politics/joe-biden-wins-georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden carried Georgia</a> and Warnock and now-Sen. Jon Ossoff <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly defeated</a> their opponents.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special election involving Warnock featured a jungle primary in the November election when multiple candidates from the same party ran. The combined Republican vote narrowly led the combined Democratic vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> This year, Warnock emerged victorious again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Partisans, including ones I spoke with for this story, will tell you a simplified story about Georgia’s politics, often spinning facts about the state’s political leanings to fit a certain political narrative. But the problem is that two things can be true at once: Georgia is getting more competitive, and it’s also still quite red.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example: Democrats haven’t narrowed the margins everywhere — especially in governor’s races. Since the 2000s, Republicans have dominated the state’s executive office and have often won those seats by high single-digit margins. That wasn’t the case in 2018, when Republican Brian Kemp eked out a 1-percentage-point win over Democrat Stacey Abrams for the open governor’s seat. But there were other factors at play that year — including the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/21/2018-midterms-republicans-trump-warning-312404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presence of former President Donald Trump</a> in the White House — and this year reverted back to the status quo. Kemp, now an incumbent, sailed to reelection last month, beating Abrams by roughly 7 percentage points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, Walker’s showing on the first ballot and the subsequent runoff was a historic outlier. He was the only statewide Republican to <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/11/10/republicans-sweep-georgia-state-offices-retain-legislature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not win outright</a> in November, and on top of that, his vote share was the lowest of any Georgia GOP candidate in a Senate, governor or presidential race since 2000.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding jungle primary results, when more than one Republican was on the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Walker did have his fans. William P.,<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William declined to give his last name because he wanted to protect his privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> a 79-year-old retiree who I met at a Walker campaign event at the Governors Gun Club in Kennesaw, Georgia, early Monday evening said he’s followed Walker’s career trajectory since his football days. “If he was running for president, I’d vote for him,” William said. “I mean, why not? He stands out. What he’s saying makes sense. He’s not going to kiss up to anybody.” But that sentiment wasn’t shared among all Republicans. The state’s Republican lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, who <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/georgia-runoff-election-walker-warnock-geoff-duncan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not seek reelection</a> this year, made headlines for saying he <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/why-geoff-duncan-didnt-cast-a-ballot-in-the-senate-runoff/I5QYKFVZHZDG7OGLZ5GPIHC5QU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t vote for either candidate</a> in this year’s runoff election. He also called Walker “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/03/herschel-walker-georgia-runoff-geoff-duncan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the worst candidates</a>” in GOP history.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That particular claim might be hard to prove — but Walker was definitely a flawed candidate. Prior to November, he was beset with <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/4/23387712/herschel-walker-georgia-senate-raphael-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous controversies</a>, including allegations that he encouraged and/or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-woman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid for multiple women</a> to terminate their pregnancies (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/herschel-walker-denies-new-abortion-allegation-rcna54205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which Walker denies</a>), despite once campaigning on a platform that included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a total ban on abortions</a>. And in the lead-up to Tuesday, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/politics/kfile-herschel-walker-texas-tax-break-georgia-runoff/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN reported</a> that Walker is receiving a tax exemption on his home in Texas meant for primary residents of the state, while running for Senate in Georgia. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1445522139-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1445522139-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1445522139-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1445522139-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker told Georgians that a vote for him was a vote against President Biden. But his case for himself felt curiously empty.</figcaption></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">So one takeaway from this race has nothing to do with the fundamental makeup of Georgia. It’s simply that parties need to avoid nominating problematic candidates. “I think it’s fair to say that both political parties in Georgia are going to see more vetting of candidates for major races going into the future,” said Mark Rountree, the president of Landmark Communications, Inc., a political consulting and polling firm based out of Georgia. “There were a lot of congressmen and other candidates who have already been vetted in previous campaigns, who could’ve run and had fewer issues than Walker.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And campaigns matter too. Walker had the bad fortune to go up against Warnock, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/politics/cnn-poll-georgia-senate-runoff-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a relatively popular incumbent</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0GA00559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fundraising behemoth</a>. In fact, Warnock had so much money that he was able to spend it reaching out to voters in parts of the state that would normally never even consider voting for a Democrat. Selden Deemer of Lumpkin County, a rare Democratic-leaning independent who cast a ballot for both Warnock and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in the general election, said he received more Warnock mailers than Walker mailers in the lead-up to the runoff. And Lumpkin County, he said, feels very far from the safely blue Democratic enclaves like Fulton, Cobb, Gwinnett and DeKalb counties. “A bear ran off with our trash can once, so it’s a very different experience from Atlanta,” he said. A more relevant — but less ursine — difference is that unlike the counties surrounding Atlanta, former President Trump won Lumpkin County by large margins in 2016 and 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in a state where turnout is the defining factor in close races, Warnock’s message may have been more compelling. I was struck by the differences in how the two candidates interacted with voters: At the Students for Warnock rally, the pastor gave an energizing 25-minute speech in which he ticked off a list of congressional accomplishments that he said would’ve been impossible without the support of young people — including his own election to Congress. “I want you to vote like it’s an emergency,” he said. “Vote like health care depends on it, vote like a women’s right to choose depends on it — because it does.” Walker, meanwhile, let his surrogates do a lot of the talking for him. In fact, his own speech at one of the last stops on his “Evict Warnock Bus Tour” capped at just about 6 minutes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Standing in the audience at each event, it was striking to hear the candidates make their pitch. Sure, both men were steadfast about framing a win for them as existential in nature: A vote for Warnock went toward preserving democratic values, while a vote for Walker gave voters a ticket to place checks on Biden. But in a political world in which every election is presented like the end of days are upon us, it <em>did </em>feel like Warnock’s speech was more tailored to his chosen audience, while Walker’s had less heft. The former football star took a common tack, framing the race in national terms: “A vote for my opponent is a vote for Joe Biden and a vote for Chuck Schumer.” But his pitch for himself was curiously empty — a vote for Walker, for example, said nothing about the GOP’s standard bearer, Trump. “A vote for me is a vote for Georgia values,” he said. But he didn’t elaborate on what those values actually were.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this left me with the inescapable conclusion that Georgia just can’t be colored with a single political dye — at least not yet. Everyone still wants to answer that pesky question: Is Georgia red? Purple? Indigo? Violet? Periwinkle? The real answer is probably “all of the above.” It’s hard to pinpoint exactly which factors were most responsible for Warnock’s win, but they don’t seem to have been present in any of Georgia’s other statewide races. In short, Warnock’s victory is more proof that Georgia <em>can</em> go blue. But whether it <em>will</em> go blue in the future remains to be seen. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">I’m not that impressed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term projections of Democratic doom in the Senate</a>. Mostly that’s because I’m not that impressed by long-term political projections in general. Political coalitions change; not many people would have had it on their bingo card that Democrats would obtain a Senate majority in 2020 by winning two runoffs in Georgia, and then would actually <em>expand</em> on that majority in 2022 <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/georgia-senate-warnock-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following another runoff in Georgia</a> despite their party controlling the White House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that said, while I don’t think we can say very much about what politics will look like 10 or 20 years from now, a <em>medium-term</em> look-ahead is possible. Do Democrats have a reasonable hope of regaining a trifecta — control of the House, Senate and presidency — at any point in the near future (2024, 2026 or 2028)? And how long will they hold onto control of the Senate and the presidency, allowing them to appoint Supreme Court justices without Republican help?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">My colleague Geoffrey Skelley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-senate-2024-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already took an initial look at the 2024 Senate map</a>, which is bad for Democrats, but I wanted to dig slightly deeper and also consider 2026 and 2028. Like Geoffrey, I’ll be focused on the Senate, because that’s the weakest link in Democrats’ effort to win back the trifecta. Despite some disadvantages in the Electoral College, Democrats obviously have no trouble winning the presidency. And they nearly held onto the House this year despite losing the popular vote for the House. The current House map <a href="https://decisiondeskhq.com/the-us-house-was-biased-toward-democrats-in-2022-why-republicans-are-developing-a-geography-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t have much — if any — of a Republican skew</a>, and Democrats should be able to win back the House if the national political environment is reasonably good for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s look at the 2024, 2026 and 2028 Senate maps (yes, 2028 features the same map as the midterm we <em>just</em> finished; I just can’t let go, I guess). We’ll classify races into bronze, silver, gold and platinum “tiers” in terms of how feasible they are as pickup opportunities. I’m deliberately using this goofy metallurgical theme as opposed to the categories FiveThirtyEight typically uses (e.g., “toss-up,” “lean Republican”) so you’ll recognize these as being back-of-the-envelope suppositions rather than any sort of official race ratings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In general, these ratings lean heavily on looking at how close a race was the last time it was contested, with some subjective adjustments for candidate quality. I’m also considering how the electoral environment has shifted within the state — Florida has gotten redder since Rick Scott was elected in 2018, for instance — although it is definitely <em>not</em> always safe to assume a state will continue trending in the same direction.</p>



<h2><strong>2024</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Republican pickup opportunities</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier: </em>West Virginia (Manchin), Montana (Tester), Ohio (Brown), </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> Arizona (Sinema), Nevada (Rosen)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> Wisconsin (Baldwin), Michigan (Stabenow), Pennsylvania (Casey)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> New Jersey (Menendez), Virginia (Kaine)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Geoffrey noted, the platinum-tier states listed here are the Democrats’ main problem. They have three senators up for reelection in states that Donald Trump carried by 8 (Ohio), 16 (Montana) and 39 (West Virginia!) percentage points in 2020. Each of those Democratic senators won reelection in 2018, of course, but that was a strong Democratic year, and there’s been further movement of white voters without college degrees — a key part of the electorate in these states — toward Republicans since then. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I don’t want to focus too much on any one individual race, but it’s probably safe to assume that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/10/senator-manchin-approval-rating-drops-west-virginia-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Manchin has the toughest reelection campaign of all</a>. Meanwhile, maybe Sherrod Brown can feel a bit more comfortable following Tim Ryan’s relatively good performance in Ohio this year, but Ryan did lose, and Brown may face a tougher opponent than Ryan did in J.D. Vance. Democrats also run the risk of retirements here; neither Manchin nor Jon Tester has officially yet announced they will seek reelection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond the platinum tier, Democrats face some other risks. Kyrsten Sinema is <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/168804/ruben-gallego-says-kyrsten-sinema-only-cares-herself-nothing-help-arizona-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely to face a serious primary challenge</a>. Democrats keep winning close races for Congress in Nevada but it’s a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nevada-could-be-senate-republicans-ace-in-the-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very purple state</a>. Tammy Baldwin, Debbie Stabenow and Bob Casey won by fairly comfortable margins in 2018 and will likely be fine in the event of a decent-to-good Democratic year, but if 2024 turns into a good Republican year, they could be in trouble.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Democratic pickup opportunities</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> Texas (Cruz), Florida (Scott)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conversely, it’s very slim pickings for Democrats. On paper, you’d think that Texas might be close — Ted Cruz won by less than 3 percentage points there in 2018 and Texas is more competitive than it once was — but the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-republican-gains-in-south-texas-win-them-more-house-seats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">erosion of the Democratic vote in South Texas</a> has prevented Texas from turning truly purple. And although Scott won by only 0.12 percentage points in 2018, Republicans did so well in Florida in 2020 and 2022 that I was tempted to demote his race all the way to the bronze tier. Plus, there’s a good chance that the GOP’s 2024 nominee will be either Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or Florida resident Donald Trump, which could help drive Republican turnout.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond that, any other races look like an extreme stretch for Democrats. Maybe Josh Hawley in Missouri could be vulnerable in a 2018-type environment, but that’s less likely in a presidential year and Hawley’s approval rating <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=79454b16-49f5-4cb0-9e32-bf3e045acc6d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t that bad</a>. Put him in the “honorable mention” tier, I guess.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given all this, I’d imagine the modal outcome from 2024 is something like Republicans picking up about three Senate seats. There’s uncertainty around that; it’s surely within the realm of possibility that Democrats hold the Senate, but it’s also possible that Republicans could wind up with 54 or 55 seats. And of course, all of these races are correlated. If the GOP is doing well enough to win the presidency in 2024, they should have no trouble also winning the Senate.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And keep in mind in that case that the GOP would only need one pickup to control the Senate since they’d have the vice president’s tiebreaking vote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a></p>



<h2><strong>2026</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Republican pickup opportunities </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier: </em>Georgia (Ossoff), Michigan (Peters)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> New Hampshire (Shaheen)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> Minnesota (Smith), Virginia (Warner)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2026 map is more balanced. Democrats undoubtedly feel pretty good about how they’ve performed in Georgia and Michigan in the past two cycles, but Jon Ossoff and Gary Peters won by extremely narrow margins in 2020 and it would be a mistake to assume they’re safe. It’s not a particularly deep set of pickup opportunities for Republicans, though if Democrats retain the presidency in 2024, you’d expect Republicans to have good midterms in 2026, and New Hampshire and perhaps even Minnesota and Virginia could potentially be in play. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Democratic pickup opportunities </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> Maine (Collins), North Carolina (Tillis)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> Alaska (Sullivan)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> Texas (Cornyn), Iowa (Ernst)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democrats will try again in the two states that were most disappointing to them in 2020: Maine and North Carolina. Given all the focus on Georgia, I wonder if North Carolina hasn’t become underrated as a place where Democrats could gain ground in the future; the states are fairly similar demographically and it wouldn’t take that much of a shift for Democrats to go from narrowly losing races in North Carolina to narrowly winning them. Susan Collins will be 74 years old in 2026, meanwhile, an age at which there’s typically some chance of retirement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats also have a below-the-radar pickup opportunity in Alaska, where Mary Peltola was elected to a full term in the U.S. House<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peltola had previously won a special election earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> last month by a 10-point margin after ranked-choice votes were tabulated. GOP incumbent Dan Sullivan has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-every-senator-and-governor-ranks-according-to-popularity-above-replacement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mediocre approval rating</a> and a Peltola-Sullivan race would potentially be competitive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Suppose, though, that Democrats win the presidency but lose the Senate in 2024. It’s really not as crazy as it sounds. If every state votes identically to how it did in the 2020 presidential election — and every Senate race follows the presidential vote — then Democrats would come out of 2024 with the presidency but only 48 Senate seats after losing West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. Could Democrats pick up two Senate seats from the GOP in the 2026 midterm while controlling the presidency? Unlikely — but then again, Democrats gaining Senate seats this year seemed unlikely and they did it.</p>



<h2><strong>2028</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Republican pickup opportunities</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> Nevada (Cortez Masto), Pennsylvania (Fetterman), Arizona (Kelly), Georgia (Warnock) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> New Hampshire (Hassan)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier: </em>Oregon (Wyden)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All right, now we’re literally coming full circle to consider the races that were just contested in last month’s midterm. So we’ll keep it pretty brief. Yes, Democrats have to feel pretty good about their wins in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia — especially given that the overall political environment <em>wasn’t</em> that great for Democrats this year. But they were <em>narrow</em> wins, and (with the possible exception of Nevada) they came against a mediocre set of GOP opponents. Maybe some of these races are toward the silver end of the gold tier, but more likely than not they’ll be competitive again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And since we’re projecting a full six years out, I’m going to be a little bit more creative about considering long-shot opportunities in the bronze tier. Although the Senate races in Washington and Colorado received attention this year (Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/02/gop-spending-colorado-washington-senate-00049108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent a lot of money on both, only to lose by double digits</a>), they wound up coming just as close in Oregon with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/oregon-senate-perkins-qanon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAnon candidate</a> as part of a comparatively strong year for the GOP in the Beaver State. Could a more mainstream GOP nominee have made it a race? Oregon is quite white, it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_educational_attainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer people with college degrees</a> than the “Portlandia” stereotype might make you assume, and Democratic incumbent Ron Wyden will be 79 years old in 2028 …</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Democratic pickup opportunities</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> Wisconsin (Johnson), North Carolina (Budd)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier: </em>Vance (Ohio)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> Alaska (Murkowski), Florida (Rubio), Utah (Lee), Iowa (Grassley)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, we’re mostly just rehashing this year’s map. Ron Johnson, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/09/ron-johnson-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally hadn’t planned on running in 2020</a>, is another retirement threat in 2026 — and he barely won reelection anyway. In Ohio, Sherrod Brown could seek to return to the Senate if he loses in 2024 by challenging J.D. Vance. And 2028 is far enough from now that I wouldn’t want to rule out Democrats being competitive in states as far-flung as Utah, where independent Evan McMullin ran a fairly competitive race against Mike Lee this year.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even with an additional senator going into 2023, the 2024 map is still so bad for Democrats that keeping the Senate for years to come will be a fairly tough order. The party’s prospects might rest more upon limiting the damage in 2024 so that it has a chance to regain the Senate in 2026 or 2028. But a bad 2024 could make it very difficult for Democrats to regain the Senate before 2030 or 2032.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That bleak picture may shape the next few years of political maneuvering. When Vox’s Dylan Matthews <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanmatt/status/1590743015379062784?s=20&amp;t=eK3Zz1VKZ2Pu2fezgnxA4g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested on Twitter</a> that liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor (age 68) and Elena Kagan (age 62) should retire while Democrats have their Senate majority and be replaced by younger justices, it didn’t go over well. But it’s a perfectly rational suggestion if Democrats don’t feel like gambling with their judicial future. (Consider how consequential Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s decision <em>not</em> to retire has been for liberals.) Democrats have a narrow path to Senate control after 2024, but it’s narrow indeed, and one that might require the GOP continuing to nominate bad candidates — and a fair share of luck.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 midterms have come to an end with Sen. Raphael Warnock beating Herschel Walker in the Senate runoff in Georgia. At the time of recording this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a> on Wednesday morning, Warnock had an almost 3-point lead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That lead could grow slightly as the tallying is finalized, but, while it was a competitive race, it was not ultimately a nail biter. The crew takes a look at how this election compares with the one in November and past runoffs. They also discuss what it can tell us about Georgia’s politics going forward and what it means for Trump’s influence in the Republican party.</p>

						After running four campaigns in two years, Sen. Raphael Warnock won’t be on the ballot again until 2028 — but at least 23 of his Democratic colleagues are up for reelection in 2024, giving Republicans a leg up in their attempt to retake the chamber.													<p>Carlos Barria / REUTERS</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In a bit of electoral déjà vu, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock won Georgia’s runoff on Tuesday, almost two years after he <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a special election runoff</a> to help hand Democrats a narrow 50-50 majority in the Senate via Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote. This time around, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgia-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92009770#senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warnock topped Republican Herschel Walker</a> to earn a full six-year term, which will have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/difference-51-seat-senate-democratic-majority-make/story?id=93278188" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major ramifications</a> for how the new Senate will conduct business in January. Warnock’s win gives Democrats 51 seats — including independent Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont — so the Democratic caucus will no longer have to constantly rely on Harris to break ties. Democrats will also now have majorities on each committee and will be able to more easily confirm President Biden’s judicial appointments.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet if we look even further into the future, it turns out the Georgia outcome could also play a role in deciding which party controls the Senate after the <em>next</em> election. The good news for Democrats is that they will have 51 seats instead of 50, which gives them a chance to maintain control even if they lose one seat, depending on whether the next vice president is a Democrat or Republican. The good news for Republicans, however, is that the 2024 Senate map puts them in a better position to take control of the chamber than it does for Democrats to hold onto it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have more than twice as many Senate seats to defend in 2024 as Republicans, an imbalance that gives the GOP a clear path to capturing the Senate — even if the Georgia result has given Democrats a little breathing room. At present, 34 Senate seats will be up for election,<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate’s 100 seats are divided into three groups called classes. The 33 seats in &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_I.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class I&lt;/a&gt; are due up for election in 2024, and Nebraska’s &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_II.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class II seat&lt;/a&gt; will also be on the ballot because Republican Sen. Ben Sasse &lt;a href="https://www.3newsnow.com/news/local-news/sen-ben-sasse-to-resign-january-8-pillen-to-officially-pick-his-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;will resign in early 2023&lt;/a&gt; to become president of the University of Florida. The seat &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/03/jockeying-to-replace-sasse-locked-up-00064740" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;will remain in Republican hands&lt;/a&gt; after Sasse’s resignation, as the incoming governor, a Republican, is expected to appoint a Republican to the seat, but Nebraska will also hold a special election for it in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a> and of those, Democrats (including the independent senators who caucus with them) hold 23 to the GOP’s 11, as the table below shows.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That Democrats have so many seats to defend in 2024 is a byproduct of past electoral success. Each <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/senate-class-population-imbalance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class of Senate seats</a> is up every six years,<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a vacancy occurs that necessitates a special election before that six-year mark. Regardless, a seat due up in, say, 2024 will be up again in 2030 even if there’s an intervening special election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> so the group of seats up in 2024 was previously up in 2018 and each six-year mark prior to that. <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1994&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 1994</a>, Republicans enjoyed a wave election in which they gained eight Senate seats. But ever since, Democrats have developed a sizable advantage among this batch of seats: <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2000&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2000</a>, Democrats gained four seats amid a razor-tight presidential election; <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2006</a>, they gained six seats thanks to a midterm Democratic wave;<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s if you still include Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as a Democrat (otherwise, it’s five). Lieberman won reelection as an independent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2006/08/09/5629128/lieberman-loses-connecticut-senate-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;after losing the Democratic primary&lt;/a&gt;, but continued &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-113sdoc11/pdf/CDOC-113sdoc11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;to caucus with his old party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2012&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2012</a>, Democrats gained two more thanks to upset wins in North Dakota and Indiana; and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2018&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2018</a>, they <em>lost</em> two net seats but managed to pick up a seat in increasingly competitive Arizona while avoiding more sizable losses by holding onto seats in Montana, Ohio and West Virginia.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-voted-protect-abortion-rights-midterms-fivethirtyeight-94370127</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But as a result, Democrats now must defend the now red-leaning seats of Sens. Jon Tester of Montana, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. All three won reelection in 2018, but those elections took place in a heavily <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/?states=PR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic-leaning environment</a> that they can’t count on having again in 2024. In addition to those three redder seats, Republicans will surely also target swing-state seats in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though Republicans have ample pickup opportunities, Democrats can realistically hope to flip only two GOP-held seats in 2024: Florida and Texas. Still, given the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-house-election-margin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong Republican showings in Florida recently</a> and the inability of Texas Democrats to break through statewide, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even as the state has become a lighter shade of red</a>, the GOP incumbents will likely start as favorites in these seats in a way that isn’t true for Brown, Manchin and Tester.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looming over each of these Senate contests is the presidential race that will undoubtedly influence down-ballot outcomes. In recent years, the party that carries a state in the presidential contest has usually won its Senate race. In 2020, just one of 35 Senate races went for a different party from the one that carried the state in the presidential election (Maine), while in 2016 all 34 Senate elections went for the same party that carried the state at the presidential level, as the chart below shows.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Most states vote for the same party for president and Senate" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9Tm2Q/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, in the next Congress, just five senators<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we include King and Sanders as Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> out of 100 will occupy seats in states that the other party’s presidential candidate carried in 2020 — and three of them are the red-state Democratic trio up in 2024. In other words, Republicans stand to benefit if the party’s presidential nominee can persuade some voters not to split their ticket in 2024 and vote for a GOP senator as well. Considering how red West Virginia and Montana are today, such a shift could be enough for Republicans to flip those two seats and win the Senate even if the GOP loses the presidency, should the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pool of split-ticket voters</a> shrink <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-midterm-voters-backed-different-parties-for-senate-and-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even further</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Georgia’s runoff in the rearview mirror, the 2024 election cycle can truly begin. And while the Democrats’ victory in the Peach State has helped give them a bit of wiggle room in the Senate, the overall map remains favorable to Republicans. To hold onto the Senate, Democrats need a lot of things to go right in 2024. While the 2022 midterm result showed how that can happen, Democrats will probably have to retain at least a couple of seats that are redder than any they had to defend this year — a difficult task in a world with fewer split-ticket outcomes between presidential and Senate voting.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The Georgia runoff is upon us! Today, the last U.S. Senate election of 2022 will finally be decided. And according to the polls, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is slightly ahead of Republican Herschel Walker — but the election is still very close.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">During the <a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/115465/web.307039/#/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nov. 8</a> general election, Warnock received 49.4 percent of the vote and Walker 48.5 percent. Although other Georgia Republicans won their races comfortably, Warnock’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/all-you-need-to-know-about-georgias-senate-race-through-tv-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advertising</a> and <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/10/06/warnock-walker-ride-eye-popping-fundraising-totals-into-georgias-senate-election-homestretch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising</a> prowess and Walker’s many <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/herschel-walker-responds-to-attack-ad-that-used-ex-wifes-accusations-of-domestic-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandals</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversies</a> helped send this race to a runoff. (Georgia is one of the few states that requires runoff elections when neither candidate gets a majority of the vote in the general election.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We aren’t issuing a forecast for this runoff as we did for the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general election</a>, but we <em>have</em> calculated a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a>. And as of Monday at 4 p.m. Eastern, Warnock was averaging 50.2 percent support, and Walker was averaging 48.2 percent. Again, this isn’t a prediction of the final results, just a summary of the polls conducted of the runoff.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1632" height="890" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">The polls in Georgia ahead of November’s election were pretty accurate. In our final polling average of the state’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election for governor</a>, Republican incumbent Brian Kemp led by 7.9 percentage points. He then won the election by 7.5. And in our final polling average of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Senate general election</a>, Walker led by 1.0 point, which was 2.0 points off the actual election result. Although the polls had the wrong candidate in the lead, they were mathematically quite close to the actual margin. Polls are meant only to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-read-2020-polls-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximate the final result</a>, not predict winners.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, of course, Warnock’s 1.9-point polling lead is not ironclad. Although most of the nine runoff polls give Warnock the lead, every single one has been within the margin of error. (Because margin of error applies to each candidate’s vote share, a candidate’s lead has to be almost twice as large<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.6 times, to be precise, for &lt;a href="https://www.danvk.org/wp/2008-09-25/how-to-read-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;complicated mathematical reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>17</sup></a> as the margin of error to be statistically significant.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, a few of these polls have been from pollsters without established track records. That doesn’t mean they will be inaccurate, but it is a reason to take them with a grain of salt. For example, Phillips Academy just started polling this year, so they don’t have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight pollster rating</a>, our assessment of how accurate and methodologically sound pollsters are.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our pollster ratings look at polls conducted in the final 21 days of presidential primary elections as well as general elections for president, governor, U.S. Senate and House since 1998, including polls of special elections and runoffs for these offices. If a pollster has no polls that meet those criteria, it doesn’t get a pollster rating. Because we last updated our pollster ratings &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, new pollsters since then (like Phillips Academy) don’t have ratings yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> The same is true for Patriot Polling, which only surveys people via landline telephone (not cell phones), a methodological red flag. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, Frederick Polls is a Democratic pollster that rarely releases public surveys. From 1998 to 2020, it released only seven polls that qualified for pollster-rating consideration, earning them only a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/frederick-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provisional grade of B/C</a>. Finally, we’ve analyzed 20 polls from Impact Research (under its former name, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/alg-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ALG Research</a>), but only four from <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/fabrizio-lee-associates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates</a>. Moreover, the two organizations’ partnership is new this cycle, so we haven’t had a chance to judge how accurate their polling is in combination.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">However, five surveys from more established pollsters (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/emerson-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/opinion-savvy-insideradvantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InsiderAdvantage</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/ssrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSRS,</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/surveyusa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyUSA</a><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/emerson-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> and the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/university-of-massachusetts-lowell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Massachusetts Lowell</a>) all consistently put Warnock a few points ahead of Walker. That said, it wouldn’t be shocking to see an unexpectedly strong performance from either of the candidates. Other factors agree with the polling that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-either-candidate-could-win-georgias-senate-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this race is tight</a>, and Warnock’s polling lead is still smaller than the average polling error in U.S. Senate races since 1998.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.4 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> While Warnock may be better positioned than Walker, either candidate could still win.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><br>North Carolina is no stranger to making political waves, and in the weeks ahead, the Tar Heel State’s internal battles could create ripple effects across the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in Moore v. Harper, which stems from the North Carolina Supreme Court’s decision to reject a congressional district map drawn by the state legislature that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/04/north-carolina-supreme-court-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court found to be so extremely gerrymandered</a>, it was unconstitutional. The former’s pending ruling <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/moore-v-harper-explained-scotus-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have major ramifications</a> for the division of power over elections in every state in the country. It’s also the culmination of a decade-long effort by North Carolina Republicans to cling onto power. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Depending on how it rules, the Supreme Court could give partisan state lawmakers even greater power to draw district lines and run elections, while weakening the authority of state courts to keep those powers in check. And in charting the course of this case, it’s clear exactly what the plaintiffs — North Carolina Republicans — hope to gain. The story starts over a decade ago, when the GOP took control of the Tar Heel State’s legislature, and winds up at the steps of the Supreme Court, where some of those same Republican lawmakers are hoping to shore up their power in a <a href="https://www.wral.com/data-shows-nc-population-boom-the-nation-s-third-biggest-jump-over-year-span/20369530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast-growing</a> and <a href="https://abc11.com/nc-census-2020-results-data/10948281/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demographically shifting</a> state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">North Carolina’s most <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/the-bathroom-bill-that-ate-north-carolina-214944/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme political maneuvers</a> have threatened to seep <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/states-see-a-new-wave-of-transgender-bathroom-bills/512453/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out and radicalize</a> other parts of the country before. Moore v. Harper could spring an actual leak.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Moore v. Harper emerged from a quagmire of political warfare that has been swirling in the Tar Heel State for decades. It all began … well, truthfully, it all began a few centuries ago, but for brevity’s sake, let’s start in the slightly more recent history: the 2010 midterms. Republicans rode a red wave to win control of both the North Carolina House and Senate for the <a href="https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-north-carolina-southern-progressivism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first time since Reconstruction</a>. The win was partially aided by REDMAP, a project helmed by former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gillespie-took-partisan-map-making-to-a-new-level-try-turning-that-into-a-bumper-sticker/2017/10/31/03dd5b32-ba93-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funneled funds into statehouse races with the explicit aim</a> of gaining Republican control over the upcoming redistricting cycle following the 2010 census. And since North Carolina is one of a minority of states where <a href="https://governors.rutgers.edu/governors-and-the-redistricting-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the governor has virtually no power</a> over drawing district maps, the newly GOP-controlled state assembly had total control over the redistricting process. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They wasted no time getting to work, hiring a GOP strategist renowned <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/the-league-of/309084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for his skill at crafting</a> expertly gerrymandered maps. He lived up to his reputation, helping the state legislature draw a map that would have likely given Republicans <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/the-league-of/309084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an additional four Congressional seats</a>. It was quickly <a href="https://southerncoalition.org/redistricting-lawsuit-filed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenged in court</a> by a coalition of voter rights groups including the state NAACP and League of Women’s Voters, kicking off a protracted saga of courtroom battles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every single election after that, with the exception of 2020, […] every one of those maps adopted, state and congressional, were eventually tossed and ruled unconstitutional,” said Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a nonpartisan government reform group that has frequently joined on court challenges over the maps. “And I don’t know if there’s any other state in America that can say that.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As the legal ping-pong continued, it was no secret that state lawmakers were set on drawing maps that would favor the GOP. At the time, Rep. David Lewis, a Republican member of the General Assembly’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/politics/gerrymandering-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting committee said</a>: “I propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats, because I do not believe it’s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.” These maps weren’t just theoretically skewed in the Republicans’ favor: In <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/11/7/7173403/gerrymandering-2014-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election</a> after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/13/least-three-states-republicans-lost-popular-vote-won-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election</a>, Democrats would receive a much lower share of seats compared to their share of the popular vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This legal battle eventually made its way to the Supreme Court in 2019 as <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/18-422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rucho v. Common Cause</a> (Rucho being Bob Rucho, the former chair of the state Senate Redistricting Committee). In a landmark 5-4 ruling, the court seemed to put the whole issue to bed by essentially saying “actually, federal courts don’t have a say when it comes to cases around partisan gerrymandering,” closing down one avenue to legally challenge extremely gerrymandered maps. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while all that cartographical drama was unfolding, there were yet more power struggles happening in the statehouse. In the heady final weeks heading into the 2016 election, Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the southeast portion of the state, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/readiness/stories/nc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing widespread, deadly flooding</a> and otherwise wreaking havoc for weeks. By December, it was perfectly reasonable for the GOP-controlled General Assembly to hold an emergency session to avail disaster relief funds. And if it happened to use that session to also <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/north-carolina-special-session-republicans-roy-cooper/510731/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strip the incoming Democratic governor</a> of various powers and responsibilities — notably the power to appoint members of the state election board — well, that was just the cherry on top. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The election of former Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory as governor four years earlier had given Republicans in the state a rare trifecta, and they weren’t going to relinquish such power without a fight. After his defeat in 2016, McCrory’s campaign set up a legal defense fund and <a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/undecided-gubernatorial-race-presents-problems-for-candidates/468201866/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protested vote counts</a> in 50 counties, citing “irregularities” and making allegations of voter fraud, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pat-mccrory-greensboro-north-carolina-raleigh-gubernatorial-elections-00c5b154efc6c8fc425dd7db22b03733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for which some campaign supporters were later sued</a>, before <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/05/504437210/ending-closest-governors-race-in-n-c-history-pat-mccrory-concedes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conceding a month</a> after the election. Then the state assembly stripped incoming Gov. Roy Cooper of much of the powers the office had enjoyed — most of which Cooper <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/03/north-carolina-legislative-power-grab-blocked-in-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clawed back through lawsuits</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McCrory said this wasn’t a partisan move because that same legislature had actually tried to strip powers from the governor even while he was still in office — he, too, <a href="https://www.wral.com/mccrory-sues-legislature-over-unconstitutional-commissions/14178019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to sue</a> to keep certain powers under the administrative branch. “There are constantly power struggles between the legislature and the executive branch, and not just with the governor,” McCrory said in an interview with FiveThirtyEight. “That’s been a constant battle in North Carolina for years.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, the pandemic ushered in a new drama. Republicans in the state legislature <a href="https://carolinapublicpress.org/38287/cutting-through-the-true-and-false-claims-and-confusing-legal-developments-on-nc-by-mail-balloting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to get the Supreme Court to weigh in</a> on a dispute over changes to election rules around the pandemic, but they were rebuffed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just as disputes over the last district maps, drawn a decade earlier, finally came to a close, it was time to draw new maps once again. Thanks to the continued flow of new residents to the Tar Heel State, North Carolina gained a new district after the 2020 census. The state legislature <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/cst22_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved a map</a> that converted 13 districts — eight Republican-leaning seats, five Democratic-leaning ones — to 14, with three highly competitive districts, four Democratic-leaning seats and seven Republican-leaning ones. It went about as well as the last time the state went through redistricting. Voting rights groups sued, and the Democrat-controlled state Supreme Court <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/04/north-carolina-supreme-court-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw the maps out and ordered the lawmakers</a> to try again. When the state legislature presented new maps to a three-judge panel, the state House and Senate lines were affirmed — <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article258665653.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but not the congressional districts</a>. At this point, with the primary elections looming, the judges enlisted a group of outside experts to draw up <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps to be used in the meantime</a>. The state Supreme Court <a href="https://ncpolicywatch.com/2022/02/24/judges-replace-the-nc-congressional-redistricting-plan-the-state-supreme-court-denies-all-requests-for-a-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled it was within the lower court’s authority</a> to do so. The state legislature disagreed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But to get the Supreme Court to weigh in on these kinds of state-level issues, Republicans in the statehouse needed a constitutional hook. They had toyed with just such a legal hook when trying to get the Supreme Court to arbitrate the pandemic disputes, and while the court declined to take up the case, some of the more conservative justices <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/moore-v-harper-explained-scotus-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaled support for the legal theory Republicans put forward</a>, emboldening the GOP to find another way to get it in front of the court. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The independent state legislature theory is based on a very literal interpretation of a line in the U.S. Constitution (in Article 1, Section 4), <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/clause-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which reads</a>: “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.” Disregarding the gratuitous use of capital letters, that basically means that states get to set up all the rules around election administration — like whether voters can vote by mail, or what time polling locations close — unless Congress has created a superseding rule, like the fact that elections <a href="https://www.history.com/news/why-is-election-day-a-tuesday-in-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must be held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday</a> in November. The key words are “legislature thereof,” which proponents of the ISL theory take at face value: Legislatures alone are charged with determining how elections are run in their respective states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"> </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013854093856.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013854093856.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013854093856.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013854093856.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Since 2010, when Republicans in the state legislature swept into power, North Carolina has been an epicenter for political warfare over the fairness of congressional and state legislative maps. </figcaption></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Opponents of this theory <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/11/04/the-independent-state-legislature-theory-will-not-empower-state-legislatures-to-override-presidential-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argue that historical context and centuries of precedence</a> show that “legislature” means all of the state bodies that are generally involved in setting laws, including not only legislatures but also constitutions, courts and election boards. And in fact, in its ruling in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Supreme Court explicitly noted that federal courts shouldn’t be weighing in on partisan gerrymandering … but <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/588/18-422/#tab-opinion-4114539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state courts could</a>, based on state statutes and constitutions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jason Torchinsky, a senior adviser and general counsel for the National Republican Redistricting Trust who has <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/2022.09.06_Amici_RNC%20et%20al..pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written an amicus brief</a> for Moore v. Harper, said he didn’t see the case as aimed at stripping state courts of their role in redistricting. Instead, he said the main issue was whether the court overstepped its bounds by instituting new maps, rather than simply striking down the original maps.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don’t know that there would be a decision that would basically say, ‘No challenges under the state constitution may ever be brought in North Carolina,’ because I don’t think that that’s what this case is about,” Torchinsky said. “This case is about that line drawing that I mentioned. There’s a difference between interpreting a law and making a policy.”</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Once again, political power struggles within North Carolina threaten to leach out into the rest of the country. If the Supreme Court decides to endorse even part of the ISL theory, it could sap the power state courts have to serve as a check on state legislatures when it comes to redistricting or elections more broadly. Already limited in what cases they could bring to federal court, voters unhappy with the laws their elected officials pass could lose yet another avenue to make their case. It could even mean that voter-led changes to election laws — like the efforts that brought <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/09/15/why-alaska-uses-ranked-choice-voting-and-what-we-know-about-how-it-affects-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice ballots to Alaska</a> or established an <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2018/11/07/colorado-amendments-y-z-independent-panels-for-redistricting-have-passed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent redistricting committee</a> in Colorado — could be made illegitimate since they weren’t enacted by the state legislature. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This case goes beyond the borders of North Carolina, but understanding the political climate that spawned it gives a clear picture of what’s at stake for the rest of the country. The ongoing political warfare to gain and hold power could be replicated in other states by politicians of both parties, if ISL theory — even partially — becomes the law of the land.  </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, the U.S. men’s national team defeated Iran 1-0 in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-played-to-win-against-iran-and-it-worked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grueling soccer match</a> to advance to the 2022 World Cup’s round of 16. Next up, the team will face the Netherlands on Saturday in a win-or-go-home game in which the U.S. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-world-cup-predictions/matches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be the underdog</a> — but not a total longshot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet while the U.S. team’s on-field performance has surely pleased Americans, a substantial chunk of the country remains skeptical of the decision to hold the tournament in Qatar. The host country has drawn scrutiny for not only the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/soccer/qatar-and-russia-bribery-world-cup-fifa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegedly corrupt manner</a> in which it won hosting rights, but also for its <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/qatar/report-qatar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human rights practices</a>, including discrimination against women and LGBTQ people, and the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistreatment of migrant workers</a>, who <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/11/14/qatar-rights-abuses-stain-fifa-world-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered from labor abuses</a> such as wage theft, injury or death while building the gleaming infrastructure used for the World Cup. Still, such wariness has not notably dissuaded Americans from tuning in to watch the tournament.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans may have actually become more critical of the decision to have Qatar host the World Cup since it began. In late October, before the event kicked off, <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/sport/articles-reports/2022/11/11/europeans-and-americans-hosting-world-cup-qatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov surveyed attitudes in six Western nations</a>, including the U.S., and found Americans didn’t notably favor or oppose Qatar hosting. Asked if it was acceptable or unacceptable for Qatar to hold international sporting events, 31 percent of Americans (which included a mix of self-identified soccer fans and non-fans) <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/nsr9bko9vy/YouGov%20-%20World%20Cup%202022%20boycotts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said it was acceptable</a> compared with 22 percent who said it was unacceptable. Forty-seven percent said they weren’t sure. By contrast, most other Western nations didn’t think Qatar hosting a major athletic event was acceptable: Majorities of respondents (which again included a mix of fans and non-fans) in France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. said it was unacceptable, though 46 percent of Italians said it was acceptable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But subsequent polling from YouGov/The Economist found a greater share of Americans viewed it as wrong for Qatar to host the World Cup specifically. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/gebmjsbpbw/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In mid-November</a>, just before the event started, 36 percent of Americans said it was wrong for Qatar to host in light of the criticisms over the country’s “human rights record and stance on LGBTQ+ rights,” while 23 percent thought it was right for Qatar to host (41 percent weren’t sure). But <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/3jonl2kylh/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two weeks later</a>, 45 percent said it was wrong for Qatar to host, while 18 percent said it was right (37 percent weren’t sure).<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second iteration of the question excluded the mention of Qatar’s stance on LGBTQ+ rights, which may have influenced the result to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> Many Americans don’t have an opinion, but the increase in net opposition to Qatar’s host status (from +13 to +27) suggests a large section of the public is critical.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans also seem favorably disposed toward addressing human rights concerns in Qatar. Another YouGov poll, conducted in August and September <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/qatar-global-survey-shows-overwhelming-demand-for-fifa-to-compensate-world-cup-migrant-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on behalf of Amnesty International</a>, found 54 percent of Americans agreed that U.S. soccer officials should speak out on human rights issues associated with Qatar, while 56 percent supported FIFA using some of the money generated by the tournament to compensate migrant workers who have suffered while preparing the country for the event. Now, Americans were comparatively less supportive of both prompts than most of the other 14 countries polled, but the U.S. also had a larger share of people who weren’t sure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, controversy surrounding aspects of this World Cup hasn’t necessarily made Americans want the U.S. team to pull out of the tournament. The most recent poll from YouGov/The Economist found that 32 percent said the U.S. team should have boycotted the World Cup while 31 percent opposed the idea (37 percent weren’t sure), which means a notably smaller share favored this more aggressive action than the share that said it was wrong for Qatar to host.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it turns out plenty of Americans have been watching. Headed into the tournament, polls from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/11/21/world-cup-2022-american-fan-viewership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a>, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-11/Ipsos%202022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Global%20Advisor%20Survey%20-%20Global%20Press%20Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos</a> and <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/b75fbhixvm/Amnesty%20International%20World%20Cup%20-%20US%20Results%20-%20148%2025.08.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Amnesty International</a> found that around a quarter of Americans were likely to watch at least some of the event. It’s true that the internationally focused Reuters and YouGov/Amnesty International surveys put the U.S. well toward the bottom of countries polled when it came to the population share who planned to follow the World Cup. Yet this isn’t that surprising, considering <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/12/world-cup-us-soccer-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soccer usually ranks</a> behind other team sports like (American) football, basketball, baseball and (sometimes) hockey in terms of Americans’ level of general interest, whereas <a href="https://statisticsanddata.org/most-popular-sports-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soccer is the most popular sport</a> in most other nations. Despite this, Americans are still tuning in: Nearly 20 million <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/world-cup/2022/11/29/6386436f268e3eae298b4582.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watched the U.S. team’s second group match</a> — against England — which Fox Sports said was the most-watched men’s soccer game in U.S. history.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even as this World Cup moves into the “knockout” stage, we can look ahead a bit to 2026, when the U.S. will co-host <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next World Cup</a> with Canada and Mexico. So we’ll be hearing plenty about international soccer in the coming months and years, no matter what happens against the Dutch.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Led by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-partisan-divide-hasnt-been-this-sharp-in-generations/">a conservative majority</a>, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently released decisions that favor conservative religious values and groups, including <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392">overturning the constitutional right to an abortion</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1088_dbfi.pdf">refusing to allow</a> states to exclude private religious schools from certain public funding programs. As a result, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/11/30/growing-share-of-americans-see-the-supreme-court-as-friendly-toward-religion/">the Pew Research Center recently found</a> that 35 percent of Americans viewed the court as “friendly” toward religion, up from 18 percent in 2019. By comparison, 51 percent considered the court “neutral” toward religion, down from 69 percent in 2019, while an equivalent share (11 percent) said it was “unfriendly” in 2019 and 2022. Americans across most demographic and religious groups increasingly viewed the court as friendly toward religion, with some of the largest shifts coming among Democrats (52 percent said the court was friendly, up from 25 percent in 2019), the religiously unaffiliated (51 percent, up from 26 percent) and those with a four-year college degree (48 percent, up from 23 percent).</li><li>As society enters a potentially volatile period for social media, <a href="https://www.grid.news/story/technology/2022/11/23/twitter-and-tiktok-get-all-the-attention-polling-shows-few-us-adults-use-them/">Harris/Grid conducted a poll to examine</a> social media usage among American adults. Facebook remained dominant as 75 percent of Americans reported using it in the past six months, while YouTube was close behind at 71 percent. About half (51 percent) said they used Instagram, but only 34 percent said the same of Twitter and TikTok. But there were sizable generational differences, as the youngest Americans in the poll (Gen Z) were far more likely to use YouTube, Instagram and TikTok than older Americans.</li><li>In <a href="https://politics.georgetown.edu/2022/11/30/november-2022-battleground-civility-poll/">its post-midterm survey</a>, the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Civility Poll found that 75 percent of Americans agreed that “democracy is under attack,” while only 24 percent disagreed. Americans of all political stripes mostly agreed, including 80 percent of Democrats, 72 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of independents. Most people agreed, regardless of their party affiliation, that biased news coverage, decreasing respect and civility, social media self-reinforcing users’ views and an increasing amount of violent behavior were extremely or very serious threats to democracy. But Democrats and Republicans strongly disagreed about other issues, with Republicans far more likely to say that “voter fraud causing stolen elections” and “woke culture imposing out of touch liberal values” were extremely or very serious threats, while Democrats were much more inclined to say this regarding “voter suppression and intimidation efforts.”</li><li><a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/12/01/covid-19-vaccines-booster-shot-survey-data/">Morning Consult found</a> a slight decline in the share of Americans who plan to get a COVID-19 booster sometime in the next year. In mid-November, 53 percent of U.S. adults said they would “definitely” or “probably” get a booster, down from 58 percent in September. When respondents who were already vaccinated but not boosted were asked for “major” or “minor” reasons why they weren’t getting a booster shot, 45 percent said they didn’t see the point and 40 percent said they weren’t worried about getting COVID-19.</li><li>COVID-19 is still on some Americans’ minds as they start to make holiday plans, though, according to a <a href="https://time.com/6235801/covid-19-holiday-plans/">Harris/Time survey</a>. Overall, there’s evidence that concerns about COVID-19 may be ebbing, since 72 percent of American adults planned to celebrate with at least one person outside their household, down from 81 percent in 2019 but up from 66 percent from 2021. But traveling for the holidays may still be more limited than it was before the pandemic, as 45 percent said they planned to go somewhere for the holidays, up only slightly from 42 percent in 2021 and down from 58 percent in 2019. And 55 percent said concerns about COVID-19 will affect their holiday plans, with around one-third specifically planning to limit the size of their gatherings.</li><li>Now that it’s early December, Americans are ready to be bombarded with holiday advertising. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/11/28/holiday-marketing-timing-november/">Morning Consult survey</a> in mid-November found that about half of Americans said that mid-November or late November were “just right” for brands to begin holiday marketing campaigns. In fact, 53 percent said early December was “somewhat” or “way” too late for brands to start advertising. But an overwhelming 66 percent thought that starting holiday advertising in mid-October was somewhat or way too early. One thing is for sure: Americans like holiday ads. The survey found that 70 percent said they were at least somewhat enjoyable while only 24 percent said they were somewhat or mostly annoying.</li></ul>

<p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 election for the House of Representatives was so close<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like Republicans will wind up with 222 seats and Democrats with 213. One district, the California 13th, still does not have a projected winner, but the Republican is in the lead as of Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> that if any number of things had gone differently, Democrats might have kept their majority. And one of the biggest things that affected the battle for the House was redistricting — the decennial redrawing of congressional districts’ lines to account for the results of the 2020 census.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But was the impact of redistricting significant enough to swing the House to the GOP? <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As I wrote in June</a>, the 2021-22 redistricting cycle didn’t radically change the partisanship of the national House map, so I mostly agree with those who say <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/18/gerrymandering-did-not-cost-democrats-house-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting didn’t cost Democrats the House</a>. But at the same time, those who say <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/11/16/2136410/-Republicans-just-took-control-of-the-House-because-of-partisan-and-racial-gerrymandering-Here-s-how" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans won only because they gerrymandered</a> are also technically correct. How can both things be true? Allow me to explain. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One way to test the claim that “redistricting cost Democrats the House” is to assess whether Democrats would have held onto the chamber if redistricting had never happened. We at FiveThirtyEight have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already calculated</a> how many percentage points each district swung left or right thanks to redistricting. For example, a district that went from a partisan lean<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> of R+2 to D+3 got 5 points bluer. Then I compared this swing to the current 2022 House margin in that district.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Monday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> Suppose a party lost by less than the district swung away from that party in redistricting. In that case, it’s likely that redistricting cost that party the seat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this is a hypothetical — and imperfect — exercise. Some districts changed substantially and wouldn’t have swung uniformly like that had they not been redrawn.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some old districts, it’s not even obvious which new district they should be paired with. I used the &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-redistricting-tracker-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;same methodology&lt;/a&gt; we used in the redistricting tracker: a combination of how much the districts overlap and where the old district’s incumbent ran for reelection, if they ran at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>24</sup></a> In addition, if they had not changed, different districts might have attracted different candidates and different levels of spending from national groups, each of which could have affected the result. But this method can still give us a rough idea of what might have happened in a redistricting-less world.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using this method, we can see that Republicans flipped a net six seats because of redistricting.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans flipped three seats in Florida alone thanks to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extreme-bias-of-floridas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely GOP-friendly map</a> pushed through by Gov. Ron DeSantis. They also used their control over the Georgia and Tennessee redistricting processes to convert the Democratic-held Georgia 6th and Tennessee 5th into safely red seats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Democrats also caught a few bad breaks in states with ostensibly nonpartisan redistricting processes. For example, the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission made the 2nd and 6th districts<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly numbered the 1st and 2nd, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> about 10 points more Republican-leaning. In Michigan, the state’s Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission redrew the 10th District<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly the light-blue 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> to be light red. And court-appointed experts nudged the New York 17th and Virginia 2nd rightward enough that they flipped too. Meanwhile, Democrats on the New Jersey Congressional Redistricting Commission voluntarily sacrificed the 7th District to protect vulnerable Democrats in other districts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, Democrats flipped a few seats thanks to redistricting. They drew some very Democrat-friendly maps in Illinois and New Mexico, enabling them to pick up the Illinois 13th and New Mexico 2nd. A court reconfigured North Carolina’s 13th District from a solidly red seat into a swing district that Democrats narrowly carried. And Republicans made the Ohio 1st District and Texas 34th District bluer, with the unfortunate (for them) side effect of handing those seats to Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we also need to consider seats that <em>didn’t</em> flip but <em>would have </em>if redistricting had not occurred. And this is where Democrats benefited the most, gaining six seats on net — and canceling out Republicans’ gains from the flips that did occur.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats drew maps that likely allowed them to avoid losing the Illinois 14th, Illinois 17th, Nevada 3rd, Nevada 4th and Oregon 4th. They also held onto the New Jersey 3rd thanks partly to their sacrifice of the 7th District. Meanwhile, court-ordered maps probably kept the New York 18th and Virginia 7th in the Democrats’ column. And Democrats may even have DeSantis to thank for them holding Florida’s 9th District: The district got 12 points bluer in redistricting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Republicans redrew Nebraska’s 2nd District to be a tad redder, which may have saved their <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/don_bacon/412713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bacon</a>. The court-ordered map in New York also may have enabled Republicans to hold onto the New York 22nd.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly numbered the 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> And Rep. Lauren Boebert probably would have lost without the Colorado Independent Congressional Redistricting Commission making the Colorado 3rd a bit redder.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats also gained a net three seats from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reapportionment</a>, the process of subtracting congressional districts from states with sluggish population growth and giving them to states whose populations have exploded. Six of the seven districts that were eliminated by reapportionment were held by Republicans — slow-growth areas tended to be in rural and/or postindustrial areas, where Republicans usually dominate. But Republicans won only three of the seven districts that were created in reapportionment, for a net Democratic gain of three seats.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">By my reckoning, Democrats actually <em>gained</em> three seats from redistricting overall. In other words, without redistricting, Republicans’ majority would be closer to 225-210.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“But wait,” I hear you saying. “There was no world in which redistricting wouldn’t have occurred in 2021-22. So isn’t it better to calculate how the 2022 election would have gone down if redistricting had <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-alternate-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone differently</a>, not if it hadn’t happened at all?” You have a point — but the problem is, there is no objective alternative map. The congressional map could have changed in a thousand ways depending on individual, state-level decisions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, let’s engage in a few of the most commonly cited what-ifs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past year and a half, Democrats have filed <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/cases/?cycles%5B%5D=2020&amp;levels%5B%5D=Congress&amp;sortby=-updated&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several lawsuits</a> against Republican-drawn congressional maps, arguing that they are illegal partisan or racial gerrymanders. Some of these were successful, like in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>. But most weren’t resolved in time to prevent the Republican-drawn maps from being used in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what if they had been? Specifically, let’s pose a set of hypotheticals:</p>



<ul><li>The Supreme Court had instead agreed with lower-court rulings that <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/24/alabama-congressional-map-blocked-federal-court/9205925002/">Alabama’s</a> and <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2022/06/06/federal-court-rejects-louisiana-congressional-map/">Louisiana’s</a> maps <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/">violated the Voting Rights Act</a>, and that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_a/">each state</a> adopted a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb6/">new map</a> with a second Black-majority district. </li><li>A <a href="https://jaxtrib.org/2022/05/11/judge-strikes-down-part-of-florida-congressional-redistricting-map/">Florida judge’s decision</a> to reinstate a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/remedial_map_a/">Black-plurality district in North Florida</a> (which DeSantis’s map had eliminated) hadn’t been overturned on appeal.</li><li>The Ohio Supreme Court, which found in July that the state’s congressional map is <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/19/ohio-supreme-court-strikes-down-congressional-map-used-may-primary/9359835002/">unconstitutionally gerrymandered</a> but left the map in place for 2022 because it was too close to the election, had instead imposed <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/house_democratic_caucus/">this map</a> drawn by Democratic state representatives that scores well on various metrics of fairness. </li><li>A court in Utah had rejected the map passed by Republican legislators in favor of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/utah/orange_3_3/">this fairer map</a> drawn by the state’s (toothless) independent redistricting commission.</li></ul>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this world, Democrats probably would have won five more seats than they actually did.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1112" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rakich.REDISTRICTING-HOUSE.1201-3mf2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rakich.REDISTRICTING-HOUSE.1201-3mf2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rakich.REDISTRICTING-HOUSE.1201-3mf2.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rakich.REDISTRICTING-HOUSE.1201-3mf2.png?w=1340 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">This doesn’t even account for other lawsuits that voting-rights advocates filed in states like <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/12/31/lawsuits-claim-georgias-redistricting-maps-ignore-black-population-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-naacp-south-carolina-lawsuits-house-elections-eb3c5825d5c9582b708a3c7ddffd541d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Carolina</a> and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/18/texas-redistricting-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas</a>. There, we don’t have good alternative fair maps to compare with, but it’s safe to say that if the courts had ruled in Democrats’ favor, Democrats would have won a few more extra seats too. Regardless, five additional seats for Democrats would have been enough for them to hold onto a slim 218-217 majority. So yes, if every Republican gerrymander had been undone in court before the 2022 election, Democrats may have kept control of the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s assuming no additional <em>Democratic</em> gerrymanders were thrown out in court. Republicans also filed suit against <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2463334/nm-republican-party-files-lawsuit-over-new-congressional-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2021/10/12/oregon-republicans-sue-over-new-congressional-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/las-vegas-lawsuits-nevada-legislature-voting-rights-d53e0f74ac895521aea441d242cfbea2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps</a> that were biased toward Democrats. What if a court had overturned New Mexico’s map and replaced it with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/concept_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this map</a> drawn by the state’s advisory redistricting commission? Republicans would have almost certainly kept control of the state’s 2nd District. Or what if a court had struck down <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada’s map</a> and imposed a plan closer to the status quo? The GOP very well could have flipped the 3rd or 4th districts there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is, it’s impossible to say whether Democrats would have won the House in a world where no state was gerrymandered. The definition of a “fair map” is subjective, and there’s uncertainty about what type of map a court might have imposed in states like Nevada or Texas. The one thing we do know is that it would have been close. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But let’s also not lose sight of the bigger picture. Votes are still being counted in some states, but it looks like Republicans won the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/charts/house-charts/national-house-vote-tracker/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national popular vote for the House</a> by about 3 points.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for this is because &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-3-big-questions-i-still-have-about-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Democrats left more seats uncontested&lt;/a&gt; than Republicans did, missing out on hundreds of thousands of votes. But this was probably worth only 1-2 points of the popular-vote margin, so Republicans would have won the national popular vote anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>28</sup></a> The national congressional map used in the 2022 election may not have been fair, but a map that gave Democrats the majority despite losing the popular vote <em>definitely</em> wouldn’t have been. So it’s somewhat beside the point whether redistricting cost Democrats the House: Republicans won the most votes, so the most democratic (lower-case “d”) outcome prevailed.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/runoffs-are-sort-of-georgias-thing-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are headed to a runoff</a> in Georgia’s Senate race next week after neither surpassed the 50 percent threshold required by state law to win outright. But will it be a repeat of last year’s runoff — when Warnock and fellow Democratic then-candidate Sen. Jon Ossoff <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly defeated their Republican rivals</a>? Or are we heading for an election that makes 2021 look like an outlier?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The stakes of the race are high, even though Democrats have already <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-control-senate-abc-news-projects/story?id=92681603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clinched their 50-seat majority</a>, as an additional seat would give the party more leverage over its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-why-politicians-like-manchin-and-sinema-go-rogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more conservative members</a> and allow it to claim <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/democrats-better-shape-51-senate-seats-rcna57230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majorities on every committee</a>. Plus, a Warnock win would <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/georgia-runoff-democrats-2024-senate-map/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better position the party for the 2024 cycle</a>. For Republicans, a Walker win would force Democrats to rely on Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote and serve as a blow to that cushion Democrats <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/difference-51-seat-senate-democratic-majority-make/story?id=93278188" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so desperately want</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, both parties have a lot to gain — and lose — based on the upcoming runoff election. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/06/warnock-beats-loeffler-455290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You’ve read this book before</a>, right? Well, it’s worth remembering that the sequel might look a bit different, as Ossoff and Warnock’s previous wins bucked prior Georgia runoff historical trends. In fact, in the past, Republicans have typically dominated Georgia’s runoffs.</p>

 <p>*Special election</p>
 <p>Georgia rules require a candidate to win a majority of the vote in general elections or special elections; if no candidate wins a majority, there is a runoff between the top-two finishers. If a special election took place on a regular general election date, it is included in this table. In these cases, there may be multiple candidates from each party running, so the Democratic and Republican totals are the combined vote share of all candidates from that party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">However, because of what happened during the 2020 cycle and the fact that recent polling shows that this race could be a tight one, it’s hard to rely <em>only</em> on historical data. The first poll of the runoff, a November <a href="https://states.aarp.org/georgia/new-aarp-georgia-poll-voters-50-may-tip-scales-in-runoff-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research survey for AARP</a>, showed the incumbent with 51 percent support from voters versus Walker’s 47 percent. But a second, more recent, <a href="https://andoverpoll.com/2022/11/28/herschel-walker-up-by-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phillips Academy Poll</a> of likely voters, on the other hand, showed Walker and Warnock essentially neck-and-neck (48 percent to 47 percent, respectively) with 5 percent of voters still undecided. And a third <a href="https://competeeverywhere.com/2022/11/frederickpolls-and-compete-digital-release-ga-senate-run-off-poll-showing-50-50-race-with-warning-signs-for-warnock-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FrederickPolls, Compete Digital, and AMM Political</a> survey of likely runoff voters had the two men tied at 50 percent support each.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All this is to say that, this go-around, there are a number of factors working in both Warnock <em>and </em>Walker’s favor. So what’s the case that we’re heading for another 2021? And what’s the case for an outcome that looks like — er — most other statewide runoffs in Georgia’s history?</p>



<h2><strong>The case for a Warnock victory </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2021, Warnock and Ossoff won, in part, by gaining on President Biden’s November 2020 margins, especially in counties with the largest shares of Black voters. That could be because Democrats worked <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-democrats-may-have-found-their-own-southern-strategy-a-black-centric-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overtime to turn out their voters</a> and prominent figures like Stacey Abrams, the state’s 2018 and 2022 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pioneered a new playbook</a> to get voters of color out to the polls, marshaling the political power of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the growing number of Black people</a> who have moved to Georgia over the past two decades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Warnock is again <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/13/georgia-senate-runoff-warnock-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banking on voters of color</a> to deliver for him. And they very well could: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/georgia-senate-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exit polling data</a> from earlier this month (which is imperfect and subject to change) shows that roughly 28 percent of the voting electorate in Georgia was Black while 6 percent was Latino, roughly the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same shares as in 2020</a>. This shows that turnout among these blocs didn’t notably tick down despite it being a midterm election with very different dynamics from 2020 and it <em>could</em> be a sign that energy remains high among these groups. And that lines up with other polling suggesting that Warnock supporters are just more excited about backing their candidate than Walker supporters. An October <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/GA-topline_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-October-26-30_released-November-2-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> poll found that 63 percent of Warnock proponents backed the Democrat “enthusiastically,” compared with 49 percent who said the same of Walker. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, this enthusiasm gap became obvious on Election Day, when every other statewide Georgia Republican <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/11/10/republicans-sweep-georgia-state-offices-retain-legislature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won their race outright</a>. And while Warnock got the most votes of any Democratic statewide candidate, Walker got the <em>least</em> votes of any Republican candidate.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Georgia turnout numbers as of Nov. 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> It’s clear some split-ticket voting took place, too, as Gov. Brian Kemp, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgia-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92009770" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who sailed to reelection against</a> Abrams, earned over 2.11 million voters versus Walker’s 1.91 million. Warnock also finished a tad ahead of Walker in the first ballot, with 1.94 million votes, so he might have the easier path to the 50 percent winning threshold.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This discrepancy makes some sense, too, given that Walker is at the center of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/4/23387712/herschel-walker-georgia-senate-raphael-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous controversies</a>, including allegations that he encouraged and/or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-woman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid for multiple women</a> to terminate their pregnancies (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/herschel-walker-denies-new-abortion-allegation-rcna54205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which Walker denies</a>), despite once campaigning on a platform that included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a total ban on abortions</a>. More recently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/politics/kfile-herschel-walker-texas-tax-break-georgia-runoff/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN reported</a> that Walker is receiving a tax exemption on his home in Texas, which is meant for primary residents of the state, even as he ran for Senate in Georgia. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Of the roughly 2 million votes that went for Walker, some of them were bound to be from Republicans who had to grit their teeth and close their eyes and vote for him because they wanted to see a Republican Senate to put checks on Joe Biden,” said <a href="https://spia.uga.edu/faculty-member/charles-s-bullock-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Bullock III</a>, a political science professor at the University of Georgia. “Well, that’s off the table now.” As a result, he said, those same voters might stay home in this year’s runoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And with no other Republicans on the ballot, Walker won’t have the added benefit of riding another candidate’s coattails during the December runoff. Warnock also has the small — but not insignificant — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advantage of incumbency</a> on his side. Plus, he’s a fundraising behemoth, with nearly <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0GA00559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$29.7 million on hand</a> as of Nov. 16, compared with Walker’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2GA00225/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9.8 million</a>, and has the support of Democratic heavyweights like <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-11-21/obama-to-campaign-for-warnock-on-dec-1-before-ga-runoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Barack Obama</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The last wildcard that <em>could </em>benefit Warnock is Trump. His recently announced presidential run and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/georgia-senate-election-donald-trump-defends-herschel-walker-after-abortion-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing of Walker</a> could motivate Democrats who “don’t want to give him a win,” Bullock told me. Republicans in the state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/us/politics/trump-herschel-walker-georgia-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similarly raised concerns</a> about whether Trump’s involvement in the race could hurt Walker, but Warnock is <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1593248795802095622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already running TV ads</a> tying his opponent to the former president. </p>



<h2><strong>The case for a Walker victory </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we’d be silly to write off Walker’s candidacy in this race. (There’s a reason why our final Deluxe forecast, which was frozen early Nov. 8, estimated that Walker would have a significant edge in a runoff). If nothing else, he may still be helped by the state’s historical tendency toward a more Republican-leaning runoff electorate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we’ve written previously, in the 11 runoffs between a Democrat and a Republican for statewide office, held between the late 1960s and 2020, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most favored Republicans</a>. In fact, in seven of those races, the runoff margin was better for the GOP than the general-election margin. This is largely attributable to the drop-off in turnout — fewer people vote in runoff races than in general elections — and the decline usually disproportionately affects Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That wasn’t the case last year, but that was in part because Trump dissuaded Republicans from trusting the state’s electoral system — which <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/turnout-dip-among-georgia-republicans-flipped-us-senate/IKWGEGFEEVEZ5DXTP7ZXXOROIA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dampened GOP voter turnout</a>. But Trump is doing the exact opposite this year.<em> </em>In fact, during his 2024 presidential campaign announcement, the former president implored Republicans to support Walker, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/11/15/trump-announces-a-third-bid-for-the-presidency-even-as-gop-reels-from-midterm-setback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling him</a> “a fabulous human being who loves our country.” On top of that, Walker has also held events <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/us/politics/herschel-walker-raphael-warnock-georgia-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in metro Atlanta</a> in recent weeks — which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-georgia-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bellwether for statewide Democrats</a> — and is receiving significant outside support from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/brian-kemp-stars-new-tv-ad-boost-herschel-walker-rcna58520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national Republican-aligned groups</a> to bolster his candidacy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Walker is also receiving a lift this go-around from an unlikely ally: Kemp. After <a href="https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/brian-kemp-campaigned-and-won-at-a-distance-from-herschel-walker-what-does-that-mean-for-walkers-senate-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly distancing himself</a> from the Senate hopeful in the lead-up to Election Day, the governor, who is <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-2022-elections-in-georgia-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely popular</a> in Georgia, has since become more vocal <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/herschel-walker-gets-major-boost/ar-AA14wFiQ?li=BBnb7Kz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about his support for Walker</a>. According to various reports, Kemp is also lending <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/10/mcconnell-kemp-herschel-walker-georgia-runoff-00066382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a key part of his campaign infrastructure</a> to help Walker, which includes the governor’s door-knocking, data analytics and phone banking programs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Walker might also be able to court runoff voters by tying Warnock to President Biden, who has an <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underwater approval rating in the state</a>. Biden — like Trump — notably stayed away from Georgia in the final weeks of the election and instead headed to other battleground states. But Walker has still repeatedly tried to use Biden’s unpopularity against Warnock, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/13/georgia-senate-runoff-warnock-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assailing the senator as a rubber-stamp</a> for the White House. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And despite more tepid enthusiasm for Walker’s campaign among his base, it’s possible, too, that some Democrats could sit out this race. After all, and like we said before, control of the Senate isn’t on the line like it was last year. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The 2021 Georgia runoff was different. Next week’s election will tell us if it was an outlier — or the potential harbinger of more Democratic statewide victories to come. If <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past runoffs are any guide</a>, we’d expect there to be at least <em>some </em>dropoff in turnout. In 2021, for example, turnout was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down about 10 percent from the total votes</a> cast in November 2020, and historically that was an unusually small decline in runoff turnout. “There are fewer incentives to turn out this year than there were in 2021,” Bullock said. “So we might expect less people to show up to the polls this year.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the outcome of this race will tell us which side can better mobilize their base, even during a midterm year when control of the Senate isn’t at stake. And that could start to answer a much bigger question: Is the Peach State red enough to where we can regard recent Democratic wins as an off-chance phenomenon? Or is it now more competitive — or even purple — meaning races can swing in either party’s favor based on the circumstances and candidates?</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor of Arizona, made denying the results of the 2020 election central to her campaign this year. And while <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/kari-lake-files-elections-records-suit-after-losing-arizona-governors-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she hasn’t yet conceded</a>, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-arizona-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost that race</a> to Democrat Katie Hobbs. It was one of the most high-profile examples of a pattern we saw over and over again in the midterms: When election deniers ran for offices that have significant oversight over elections themselves, voters rejected them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There was <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/projects/democracy-ballot-arizonas-2022-midterm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot</a> of <a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/democracy-ballot-year-national-voter-registration-day-2022-more-critical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk about</a> democracy <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/why-2022-elections-might-determine-future-us-democracy-1101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being on the ballot</a> this midterm cycle, with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of candidates who refused to accept the outcome</a> of the last nationwide election. And while <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/denying-the-2020-election-wasnt-a-winning-strategy-for-political-newcomers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many of those candidates (particularly incumbents) won their races</a>, when it came to those who would have a direct impact on how elections are run and votes counted, the trend was clear. Voters chose democracy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While members of Congress obviously have a role to play — 147 Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted not to certify</a> some of the results of the 2020 election, and a handful of Democrats have <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/no-trump-electoral-college-challenge-233294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">done so in past cycles as well</a> — state-level officials hold the most immediate authority over elections. In particular, secretaries of state serve as the chief election official in most states, and overseeing elections is a big part of their job. Voters recognize this and, when state-level candidates were adamant election deniers, they not only lost, they typically did worse than other state-level candidates. </p>

 <p>Uncalled races are current as of Nov. 28, 2022, 2 p.m. Eastern.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In Pennsylvania, Republican Doug Mastriano lost the governor’s race by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-pennsylvania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 14 percentage points</a> to Democrat Josh Shapiro. The governor of the Keystone State appoints its chief election official, so this is a role with an even more direct impact on elections than in other states. Mastriano <a href="https://www.witf.org/2022/06/09/how-doug-mastriano-promoted-election-lies-between-election-day-and-january-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was one of the most hardline election deniers</a> running for office this year, and even attended the rally on Jan. 6, 2021, which later turned into the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Comparatively, Mehmet Oz, the Republican who ran for Senate in Pennsylvania, lost by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-pennsylvania-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 5 points</a>. Oz not only ran for a position that would less directly impact elections in the state, but he also didn’t make the 2020 election central to his campaign — he never said it was stolen from Trump, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/25/dr-oz-pennsylvania-debate-trump-00027712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">though he did question the results</a> at times. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Arizona, though Lake lost by less than 1 percentage point, the Republican candidate for secretary of state, Mark Finchem, performed much worse, losing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-arizona-secretary-of-state.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by nearly 5 points</a>. Like Lake, Finchem equally embraced Trump’s baseless election fraud claims, but unlike Lake, he was running for a position where overseeing elections is arguably the most important part of the job (no shade to <a href="https://azsos.gov/about-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping records</a> and administering the <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/ucc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniform</a> <a href="https://azsos.gov/business/uniform-commercial-code-ucc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commercial</a> <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/ucc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code</a>, but, let’s be honest). Blake Masters, the Republican candidate for Senate, also lost by about 5 points. He, too, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-03/trump-backs-arizona-candidate-who-echoes-2020-lies" target="_blank">ran on false claims</a> during the primary that Trump won in 2020 and that big tech and the media “conspired” to rig the election — though he later <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/07/masters-kelly-arizona-debate/" target="_blank">softened his stance</a> ahead of the general election. However, in another statewide race, the Republican comfortably won by a wide margin. Kimberly Yee won reelection for the state treasurer, a role that has no direct impact on elections, by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-arizona-treasurer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 11 points</a>. This is another example of voters in Arizona not simply turning against the GOP this election cycle, but specifically rejecting certain candidates running for particular offices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">New Hampshire provides a similarly apt comparison of statewide races. Like Masters, the Republican candidate for Senate, Don Bolduc, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/28/us/politics/don-buldoc-new-hampshire.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally campaigned on the false claim</a> that Trump was the rightful winner in 2020 before <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-hampshires-bolduc-backtracks-statements-2020-election-stolen-ahead-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later pivoting to say</a> the election was not, in fact, stolen. Bolduc <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-new-hampshire-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost his race by more than 9 points</a>, while Republican Gov. Chris Sununu — who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/26/sununu-bucks-trump-in-2024-00027612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected Trump’s claims from the get-go</a> — won reelection by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-new-hampshire-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 15 points</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finchem, Mastriano, and Lake were part of a group of 17 primary candidates endorsed by the America First Secretary of State Coalition, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-is-backing-these-secretary-of-state-candidates-in-2024-master-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an organization run by a QAnon-supporting influencer</a> that aimed to get election deniers elected to key positions like secretary of state. Of those 17 candidates, only one — Republican candidate for Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales — prevailed (many of the candidates lost during the primary elections). And despite getting the seal of approval from this group, <a href="https://www.ibj.com/articles/hot-race-for-secretary-of-state-to-enliven-gop-state-convention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morales has said that 2020</a> was “obviously” a “legitimate election.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are still a lot of reasons to be concerned about the state of democracy in America — 2021 <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/voting-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought a massive wave</a> of new voter restrictions, a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-political-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disturbingly high share of Americans</a> think political violence is justified, and <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/moore-v-harper-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pending court cases</a> could severely limit efforts to curtail gerrymandering or restrictive election laws. But over and over again this fall, voters in this country made it clear that, given the choice, they’re still picking democracy. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into the 2022 election, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fewer-americans-are-likely-to-vote-for-a-republican-governor-and-a-democratic-senator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one big question</a> was just how many voters would be willing to vote for one party’s candidate for U.S. Senate and the opposing party’s candidate for governor. We’ve known <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for a while</a> that this voting behavior, known as “<a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/split-ticket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split-ticket</a>” voting, has been on the decline in U.S. elections, thanks to forces such as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarization</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative partisanship</a> that influence voters to consistently back one party. But while FiveThirtyEight’s forecast projected a further downtick in split-ticket voting this year, we didn’t know just how things would play out from state to state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With most results in now, we can safely say that split-ticket voting decreased in 2022 — for the most part. And yet, the few voters who did split their tickets mattered a lot for the outcomes in many states, especially where one party won the Senate race and the other party won the governorship.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, we were able to look at 25 pairs of Senate and gubernatorial elections in 24 of the 26 states with such pairs on the ballot in 2022.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of a special election, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/oklahoma-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92010386" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; had two Senate races with its single gubernatorial election, so we actually have 25 cases as we compare Oklahoma’s governor’s race to each Senate contest. We excluded &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/alaska-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92009734" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/idaho-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92009817" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; from this analysis: Alaska because multiple candidates from the same party ran in the Senate race, and a high-profile independent, former Gov. Bill Walker, ran in the state’s gubernatorial contest; and Idaho because fewer than 90 percent of voters in Idaho backed a Democrat or Republican for governor, making a comparison between the margins in the state’s Senate and gubernatorial races less meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>19</sup></a> Of those, five states elected senators and governors from different parties, with one more — Georgia — possibly joining them, depending on the outcome of a Dec. 6 runoff election. A few states saw sizable differences, especially deep-blue Vermont, where popular Republican Gov. Phil Scott won reelection by a whopping 47 percentage points, while in the Senate contest, Democratic Rep. Peter Welch won by a massive 40 points. But Vermont’s 87-point spread was a clear outlier: Only eight of the other 24 pairs of races had double-digit differences, including three of the five pairings that saw candidates from different parties elected. Broadly speaking, there wasn’t <em>that </em>much variation in many states, as the median difference was 7.8 points, found in New York, which ranked as the smallest in any midterm dating back to 1990.</p>

 <p>*Special election<br>†Going to a Dec. 6 runoff election to determine the winner. Margin is from the Nov. 8 election. </p>
 <p>Includes races where one Democrat and one Republican ran and excludes races where third-party candidates won at least 10 percent of the vote. Because of a special election, Oklahoma had two Senate elections, so we compared each to the state’s single governor’s race. Margins as of Nov. 28.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Still, split-ticket voters wielded significant power — even if they weren’t sizable in number — especially in three closely fought states. Most striking was Nevada, where Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto won reelection by only about 1 point while Republican Joe Lombardo bested Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak by a little over 1 point at the same time. Similarly, the handful of Wisconsin voters who backed both Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers helped both win narrow reelection victories. And while Georgia’s Senate race is headed for a runoff, that happened partly because a small group of voters who backed Republican Gov. Brian Kemp also voted for Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in the latter’s race against Republican Herschel Walker. That kept Walker below 50 percent and gave Warnock about a 1-point edge, although he too fell short of a majority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, a few states besides Vermont had fairly sizable differences that highlighted how the parties split the two races — or at the very least how one race was far more competitive than the other. New Hampshire reelected Republican Gov. Chris Sununu by 15 points while simultaneously giving Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan another six-year term by 9 points. In Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly overcame the state’s strong GOP lean to win reelection by about 2 points even as Republican Sen. Jerry Moran handily won by 23 points. And while candidates from the same party won both races in Hawaii, Ohio and Oregon, each state saw a comfortable win for an incumbent in one contest while the open-seat election for the other office was much more competitive. That these incumbents would win more easily isn’t terribly surprising, as they tend to gain <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least some advantage</a> from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379418301379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already holding office</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All in all, though, the results in these Senate and gubernatorial contests suggest that split-ticket voting has continued to decline. The median difference of about 8 points proved to be a new low in Senate-governor results in midterm elections from 1990 to 2022, as the chart below shows:</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Voters were less likely to vote for different parties this year" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DrOSO/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="471" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even with the diminished rate of split-ticket voting, about a quarter of the Senate-governor pairs we looked at had split-ticket outcomes. That share was roughly in line with midterms dating back to 2010, when between about 1-in-6 and 1-in-4 states saw different parties win their Senate and governor contests. In other words, split-ticket voting isn’t so rare — at least today, anyway — that the actual governing outcomes of these votes produce <em>no</em> split results.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s not hard to imagine us moving further in that direction in the years to come. In 2020, just one state (Maine) <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/08/once-again-nearly-all-senate-elections-reflect-states-presidential-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for different parties</a> for president and Senate, while no state in 2016 produced a split-ticket result in those two races. It’s true that midterms may remain more inclined to lead to split-ticket outcomes between top-tier races like governor and Senate because elections for governor <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still aren’t as nationalized</a> as races for federal office. That has led some voters to back a party they don’t normally support in elections for a state’s chief executive. But even then, we’re seeing increasingly nationalized gubernatorial elections, which could further reduce the rate of split-ticket voting in midterm years, too.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>The 2022 midterms just ended a couple weeks ago,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/runoffs-are-sort-of-georgias-thing-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not in Georgia&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a> but the 2024 election has already begun: Just a week after Election Day, former President Donald Trump announced he would <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-2024-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run for president again</a>. Given how little of a break we’re getting between the two campaigns, it raises the question: How could the results of the 2022 election influence the results of 2024’s?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To answer that, I’ve convened a meeting of FiveThirtyEight’s brightest political minds. How’s everyone feeling about the campaign whiplash??</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>The <a href="https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0227.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent campaign</a> is more permanent than ever.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter):<strong> </strong>Haha, our jobs are never boring — that’s for sure! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/kaleigh-rogers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleigh Rogers</a>, technology and politics reporter):<strong> </strong>People often comment that my job is only busy every other year and I laugh and laugh.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/monica-potts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monica Potts</a>, senior politics reporter):<strong> </strong>It seemed like Trump was forever promising an announcement “tomorrow,” so by the time it happened it felt like it had already happened. But yes, it is a never-ending campaign season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, let’s get one thing out of the way. Democrats had a surprisingly strong showing in 2022, especially by historical standards: They <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-blue-nevada-means-democrats-will-keep-control-of-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the Senate</a>, and they lost <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-control-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer than 10 seats in the House</a> despite the president’s party losing over <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two dozen House seats</a> in the typical midterm. Is this reason for Democrats to be optimistic about 2024 as well?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m hesitant to make sweeping generalizations about 2024 based off Democrats’ performance in 2022. Sure, Democratic victories give President Biden something to brag about in the meantime, but historically, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/09/2022-2024-midterms-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we haven’t been able to predict presidential results based on midterm elections</a>. And I don’t see why this year would be the exception.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I mean, they might take it as a reason to be optimistic. But as Alex said, historically, there’s been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stop-using-the-midterms-to-predict-presidential-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little relationship between the result in a midterm election and the result of the next presidential contest</a>. So what happened in November 2022 probably has little bearing on how November 2024 will pan out, at least in terms of votes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that’s understandable: We don’t know who the candidates will be in 2024, we don’t know what the political environment will be like and the electorate will be different! Right now, the U.S. Election Project’s preliminary turnout figure for this year is around <a href="https://www.electproject.org/2022g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 percent of the voting-eligible population</a>. With California still counting a lot of ballots, that’ll probably hit 47 percent. But in 2020, almost <a href="https://www.electproject.org/2020g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67 percent of the VEP</a> cast a ballot for president! So a lot of people who didn’t participate in 2022 will probably participate in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>Yeah, I mean midterms generally have very little correlation with presidential elections. In addition to the changes in the electorate, people just think differently about voting for president compared to voting for governor or senator. It’s the highest office, and so much depends on what happens in the months leading up to the actual election. I wouldn’t use the midterms to make any predictions about 2024, personally, other than perhaps who else might run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Two of the biggest issues motivating voters this year seemed to be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ipsos-preelection-survey-likely-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation/the economy</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-was-always-going-to-impact-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion rights</a>, and it’s just so hard to say what conditions will be like in two years. I can see red states continuing to push abortion bans or enforce the ones that already exist, but I can also see purple states moderating and blue states working to protect abortion rights. Who knows what the economy will do, but I think it’s safe to say it won’t be in the same place. I think so much depends on those conditions, who’s at the top of the tickets and what happens in the swing states where Democrats won this year, like Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>And the issues that motivated voters this fall could be way different than the issues that motivate voters in presidential election years. You might also see, for example, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-ap-top-news-politics-pa-state-wire-d55cc54be76c680219cbff477deec40e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic backlash</a> toward Trump if he ends up being the GOP’s presidential nominee, similar to what we saw in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Great points all!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yeah, for every midterm-presidential pairing like 2018-20 (when Democrats had a great midterm and then defeated Trump), there’s one like 2010-12 (when Republicans had a great midterm and then failed to unseat then-President Barack Obama).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Seriously, Nathaniel. Speaking of whiplash, one of the best examples is 1946-48, when Republicans <a href="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1901-1950/The-1946-House-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swamped Democrats</a> in the 1946 midterms to take back the Senate and House, but then former President Harry Truman <a href="https://www.history.com/news/dewey-defeats-truman-election-headline-gaffe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprised by winning reelection</a> in 1948, bringing with him <a href="https://history.house.gov/Congressional-Overview/Profiles/81st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweeping majorities</a> for Democrats in the Senate and House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>In fairness, though, 2022 is a different case — the rare example of a midterm where the president’s party did relatively well. What has happened in presidential elections after those midterms?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>Ooh, that’s a good question … for Geoff!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">(My brain holds very different esoteric knowledge.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Nathaniel, a couple examples that come to mind are 1970-72 and 1998-2000. In 1970, Republicans actually gained a seat in the Senate and lost only nine seats in the House, but Democrats retained clear majorities in both chambers. Then in 1972, then-President Richard Nixon won one of the <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1972&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatest landslide reelections</a> in U.S. history. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 1998, Democrats gained five seats in the House and preserved the status quo in the Senate amid a backlash over GOP attempts to impeach then-President Bill Clinton, but then Republican George W. Bush captured the White House in 2000. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Obviously these are two fairly different circumstances when it comes to an incumbent president running or not, which candidates were running (George McGovern was not the strongest contender for Democrats in ’72), and the events surrounding the election. But that speaks to how hard it is to know what’ll happen next! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, and there’s also 2002-04, when Republicans had a good midterm in the wake of Sept. 11 and then Bush won a narrow reelection. But of course, we’re dealing with a very small sample size here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kaleigh, you mentioned that the midterms could influence who jumps into the race for president. Do you guys think the midterms change Biden’s reelection calculus at all?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>I don’t know about change, but certainly influence. Biden has a lot of factors to consider and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/10/joe-biden-2024-president-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> he was going to discuss with family over the holidays. But he’s got to be feeling emboldened after such a strong showing in the midterms. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another influential factor has to be Trump’s announcement. Biden won against Trump once before, so there’s this underlying narrative of “he beat him once, he could beat him again,” if Trump wins the nomination. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>If Democrats had succumbed to the midterm curse that’s typical for the party in the White House, Biden may have faced <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/cnn-poll-biden-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsized pressure</a> to not run in 2024 (as he did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/us/politics/biden-2024-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before the midterms</a>). But I think, to Kaleigh’s point, you could make the argument that the results of this year’s races, coupled with Trump’s presidential announcement, clear up any doubts over whether Biden is running for reelection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Kaleigh, I think that’s right. I’ve said before that Biden’s chances of running again depended in part on whether Trump would run again, and now Trump is running. So I do think Biden may be somewhat more likely to run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, it’s also possible that Biden could decide this is a moment where the Democratic bench of potential candidates is stronger after the success of many big names in the midterms, especially governors of potentially competitive states like Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan or Jared Polis of Colorado.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>I still think it’s worth remembering that Biden remains pretty unpopular (his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating</a> is currently below 42 percent), and voters chose their Democratic candidates in House and Senate races for many reasons. I think it would be reading too much into the results to say it boosts Biden’s chances. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Geoffrey, that’s a great point about Whitmer and Polis. Both have been <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2022/11/15/after-whitmer-scores-a-big-win-speculation-about-a-future-presidential-run-ramps-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked about</a> as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/14/democrat-jared-polis-presidential-potential-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future presidential contenders</a>, and both absolutely crushed it in their reelection bids: Whitmer won by 11 percentage points, and Polis won by 19! I don’t think they would ever primary Biden, but if Biden <em>doesn’t</em> run, their theories of the case seem stronger than ever, especially if Democratic primary voters are concerned about electability again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Do we really think Whitmer or Polis stands a chance against Trump, though?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I think winning statewide office is one thing, but winning a presidential election against Trump is another story entirely. Biden already proved that he can beat him in 2020 and can campaign on Democrats’ success during the midterm elections, so I don’t see why he wouldn’t be seen as the strongest Democratic presidential contender (at least at this point in time). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if Whitmer thought Biden was a particularly weak president, she wouldn’t have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/michigan-governor-race-2022-midterm-elections-a91578081bc2141151efdf74bb4b3ccb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned with him</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Right, I think the really big question for Democrats is who should they nominate if not Biden? A rising star like Whitmer could be risky. Voters don’t really have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable opinion of Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, for lots of reasons that include sexism and racism, but she hasn’t been a super visible VP. I’m having flashbacks to the crowded Democratic field in the 2020 presidential election, which didn’t have a clear favorite until House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jim-clyburn-changed-everything-for-joe-bidens-campaign-hes-been-a-political-force-for-a-long-time/2020/03/30/7d054e98-6d33-11ea-aa80-c2470c6b2034_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Biden</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>I think Whitmer or Polis could absolutely beat Trump. I think a lot of Biden’s win in 2020 was simply based on him being the “not Trump” candidate. Trump is basically <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just as unpopular</a> now as he was before the 2020 election, and even some of his <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/republicans-explain-why-theyre-cooling-on-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporters are saying they don’t want him to run</a>. There are many capable Democrats who could fill the “not Trump” role and defeat him in 2024 if Biden were to opt against running.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>As Nathaniel said, I don’t think these candidates run if Biden does. But if he doesn’t seek reelection, they’d certainly have a decent shot of defeating Trump in a general election. For one thing, both Whitmer and Polis have put together impressive electoral track records in states that are either real swingy or at least not deep blue. Whitmer could make abortion a major issue, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/09/gretchen-whitmer-profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as she did in her reelection campaign</a>, while Polis has a <a href="https://reason.com/2022/11/10/jared-polis-success-shows-that-democrats-can-win-without-embracing-big-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit of a libertarian streak</a> in him that could expand his appeal in a general election context. Plus, Trump is one of the great unifiers in history — for Democrats, anyway. So that would help the eventual Democratic nominee to some extent. Moreover, the country is starkly divided and close presidential elections are just sort of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-biden-blowout-didnt-happen-and-why-a-2024-blowout-is-unlikely-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a matter of course these days</a>, so barring a real catastrophe for one party, we should expect another highly competitive contest in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Yes, I think so much depends on whether Trump is the nominee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m not totally convinced by the “not Trump” argument, Kaleigh. I think most of the Democratic field in 2020 campaigned on being the “<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/09/28/beto-orourke-calls-donald-trumps-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not Trump</a>” or “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pete-buttigieg-says-he-can-beat-donald-trump-in-2020/2019/04/14/ea22a7b8-5e5d-11e9-9625-01d48d50ef75_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m best positioned to beat Trump</a>” candidate. But there’s a reason why Biden was the victor in the end.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But I largely agree with your point, Geoff. I think Biden running will stop other Democrats from jumping in, so there’s not a split Democratic field. The flip side, though, is that I don’t think a Trump announcement will stop other prominent <em>Republicans</em> from throwing their hat in the ring.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3b5.png" alt="🎵"> </strong>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POfxpMqIgRE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">name on everybody’s lips</a> is gonna be … Ronny! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3b5.png" alt="🎵"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Haha, indeed, Kaleigh. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was another governor who turned in a really impressive reelection performance earlier this month. He won by 19 points in a state that, until recently at least, was considered the quintessential swing state! Do we think this strengthens his hand ahead of his widely expected presidential bid?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>That’s a good point, Nathaniel! With his landslide election in Florida, DeSantis was easily the biggest GOP storyline to come out of the 2022 election. I won’t cite exit poll data directly, but <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/florida-latinos-turned-favor-republicans-rcna57167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting suggests</a> that he performed well with Latino voters and <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/massive-desantis-rubio-wins-have-florida-and-miami-dade-seeing-red/2904788/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipped Miami-Dade County</a>, which is historically Democratic. I think his performance this year might convince Republicans that he’s the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/16/desantis-trump-2024-election-00067834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest alternative to Trump</a> — if they’re looking for one. Plus, DeSantis has long been viewed as a rising star within the GOP, so it’s not beyond the realm of possibility that he takes on the challenge.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>There’s no doubt: The results in Florida solidified DeSantis’s role as a popular Republican rising star, and at least some polls are now showing him ahead of Trump. An <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/11/16/republicans-prefer-ron-desantis-to-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted just after the election found 46 percent of Republicans said they’d prefer to see DeSantis as the GOP nominee in 2024, compared to 39 percent who said they’d prefer Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while a majority — 60 percent — of Republicans said they wanted to see Trump run in 2024 when asked before the election, just 47 percent did when asked after the election (but before Trump announced his candidacy).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I’d be careful about those polls, though, Kaleigh. We often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/13-tips-for-reading-general-election-polls-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warn people</a> to wait a while to interpret polls after major news events like debates, and the midterms definitely qualify.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>That’s true! We’ll have to wait to see if any of these turn into actual trends.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>I can absolutely see Republican party leaders coalescing around DeSantis because they know Trump motivates Democrats to vote against them. DeSantis’s policies and positions are very similar to Trump’s, and he plays to the base on issues like immigration, education and voter fraud (which, as we know, is <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ap-review-finds-far-too-little-vote-fraud-to-tip-2020-election-to-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a significant concern</a>). Republican voters seem to like him — even before the midterms, 64 percent of registered Republican voters told <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/11/09164530/2211022_crosstabs_MC_WASHINGTON_RVs_STACKED_v3_CC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> they had a favorable opinion of him. And this is anecdotal, but Republican voters where I live seem to know who he is and also like him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2016, Trump didn’t really have any opponents who could get enough support to really challenge him. Many voters thought of him as a businessman and what he would do as a politician was unknown. Now he’s a known quantity, his successful run is six years in the past and there are alternatives like DeSantis. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>DeSantis might be in a position to make himself almost a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-desantis-is-a-major-threat-to-trumps-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-favorite</a>, assuming he does what everyone expects and runs. Granted, Trump has been ahead in pretty much all national polls that aren’t testing him and DeSantis head-to-head. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Trump has led early polls, but DeSantis has been creeping up" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9Daie/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="424" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">And remember, if other candidates get into the field, they won’t be going mano-a-mano, at least not initially. The size of the eventual field is not a minor consideration either, considering Trump won with just a plurality in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2" target="_blank">2016 Republican presidential primary</a>. It remains to be seen if the many <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/business/trump-donors-schwarzman-griffin.html" target="_blank">bigwig donors</a> and influencers within the GOP who oppose Trump will rally behind one candidate or not. And it's not like Trump had their backing early in 2016, so even if they are unified, that isn't certain to stop him either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Trump has not emerged from the midterms covered in glory, though. Many of the candidates he endorsed in the primary lost the general election; in fact, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/upshot/trump-effect-midterm-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/15/data-trump-weighed-down-republican-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a> both calculated they performed 5 points worse than expected. And his intervention may have directly cost the GOP multiple seats. For example, he <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/trump-endorses-joe-kent-republican-challenger-to-rep-jaime-herrera-beutler-who-voted-for-impeachment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed far-right Republican Joe Kent</a> in the primary for Washington’s 3rd District over incumbent Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler because Herrera Beutler voted to impeach him. Kent won the primary but ended up losing the general election — which was a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/washington/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big shock</a>, because this seat is pretty red. Now, many Republican elites are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/us/politics/trump-republicans-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grumbling about him costing the party seats</a>, or at least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/trump-republicans-move-on-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not embracing his presidential campaign</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, recent history is littered with examples of Republicans appearing to break with Trump, only to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/06/nikki-haley-biggest-gop-flip-flops-trump-post-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall back in line later</a>. Do you guys think that will happen again, or is this time really different?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I tend to see this as half a 2016 circumstance, if you will. Many party elites <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/battleground-republicans-unload-trump-ahead-expected-2024-announcement-rcna57153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t want to get behind Trump</a> and will look to DeSantis as a principal alternative. But depending on the contours of the GOP presidential primary, they could definitely come flooding back to Trump if DeSantis struggles against him for some reason. And Trump will start out with far more institutional support than he had previously. You already see various Republicans announcing their support for him, like <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dont-blame-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen.-elect J.D. Vance</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Agreed, Geoff. I think if voters largely continue to back Trump, it’ll be hard for the party to step in and knock him down. To be honest, Trumpism is so ingrained within the GOP today that I almost forgot about all the intraparty grumbling during his 2016 run! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Yes, this is tricky because people underestimated Trump in 2016 and then kept declaring his campaign over — but it never was. But I do think this time is really different. Jan. 6 was a real turning point people haven’t forgotten. And as Kaleigh has written, the election denial that drove the insurrection <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/denying-the-2020-election-wasnt-a-winning-strategy-for-political-newcomers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not win seats for Republican newcomers this cycle</a>. Voters often have short memories, but I think voters remember that and want to move away from that. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Monica, I think Jan. 6 might make Trump a weaker general election nominee, but how much it hurts him in the presidential primary on the GOP side is less clear. After all, for months, even years now, a consistent 60-ish percent of Republicans have said in polling that Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/poll-61-republicans-still-believe-biden-didnt-win-fair-square-2020-rcna49630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t legitimately win the 2020 election</a>. If Trump didn’t lose in their eyes, they’re not necessarily going to view him as weaker.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Geoffrey, that’s fair. I just wonder how much this year’s midterms quieted down those beliefs. I was prepared to see losing candidates claiming election fraud or refusing to concede, and that didn’t really happen. I just wonder if the midterm results might weaken those beliefs in all but the true believers, as voters move on to other issues.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>There are Republican voters who love Trump but fear he can’t win, and they want the White House more than they want Trump to be the nominee. The question is how big of a contingent those voters are.</p>]]></description>
