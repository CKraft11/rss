<p data-paragraph="main">In summertime, I like to head north to beat the heat — and that’s exactly what we’re doing with Tuesday’s elections. The upper-latitude states of Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin are all holding their primaries on Tuesday, and Minnesota — the nation’s <a href="https://www.unitedstatesnow.org/why-is-minnesota-called-the-north-star-state.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">north star</a> — is also hosting a special election that could provide clues to the country’s political mood. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you haven’t been following these elections closely, never fear: As always, FiveThirtyEight is previewing every race with major implications for November. My colleague Geoffrey Skelley will run down the Democratic primaries of note tomorrow, but today let’s start with that special election and three big Republican primaries in two of those states.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22145631775840-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22145631775840-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22145631775840-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22145631775840-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Former state Rep. Brad Finstad is in the unusual situation of running in both the special election and the primary for Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. <p>Mark Zdechlik / Minnesota Public Radio / AP</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Minnesota</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st Congressional District (both the regular primary and special election)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/02/18/minnesota-1st-district-representative-jim-hagedorn-dies-at-age-59" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died of cancer</a> in February, and on Tuesday voters in Minnesota’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong> (specifically, those living within the district’s old, pre-redistricting borders) will choose his replacement for the remainder of his term. Given the seat’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> of R+15, the Republican candidate, former state Rep. Brad Finstad, is favored over Democrat Jeff Ettinger, the former CEO of Hormel Foods.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s not a guaranteed Republican victory, and regardless of who wins, the final margin could be telling. Special elections are often a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bellwether</a> for the results of the November election; if one party consistently overperforms partisan lean in special elections, it suggests that the national political mood <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favors that party</a>. So far in the 2022 cycle, however, Republicans have overperformed in some special elections, while Democrats have overperformed in others, making it hard to say <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-can-special-elections-so-far-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which party has an advantage</a>.</p>

This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>

</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">However, in the only special election so far to take place after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats had one of their strongest performances of the cycle — coming within almost 5 percentage points of winning Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District despite the seat’s R+17 partisan lean. That may mean Democrats were highly energized in the wake of that decision … or it could have just been due to <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/notes-on-the-state-of-the-primaries-june-29-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local factors</a>, like the scandal that ended the career of the district’s former Republican representative or the strength of the Democratic candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The special election in Minnesota’s 1st District may help clarify that. If Democrats come close to winning again — or if they pull off the upset outright — it will be another data point suggesting that the national environment is improving for Democrats. (Another is the fact that polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> have shifted more than 2 points toward Democrats since the Supreme Court decision, and Democrats and Republicans are now essentially tied.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a>) A late-July <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/surveyusa-poll-finstad-leads-ettinger-in-race-to-serve-remainder-of-hagedorns-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyUSA poll</a> of the race for KAAL-TV gave Finstad the support of 46 percent of likely voters and Ettinger the support of 38 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Complicating matters, though, is that this <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/elections/2022/07/most-but-not-all-1st-district-voters-will-vote-twice-on-aug-9-to-decide-who-will-represent-them-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t the only election</a> taking place in Minnesota’s 1st District on Tuesday: The district (this time in its new, post-redistricting incarnation) is also hosting its regularly scheduled primary to decide its nominees for the general election. And while Ettinger has no serious opposition on the Democratic side, Finstad actually faces a rematch from state Rep. Jeremy Munson, whom he defeated 38 percent to 37 percent in the May primary for the special election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As that margin suggests, the primary could be competitive even though Finstad is the official GOP nominee elsewhere on the ballot. Indeed, he could end up in the unusual situation of getting elected to Congress but then immediately losing “reelection” by not making it to the November ballot. This has also created a dilemma for Finstad’s campaign: court the Republican base by moving right, or tack toward the center to appeal to a general-election electorate? Finstad has opted to campaign as a “<a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/minnesota/cd1-candidates-finstad-munson-face-off-in-farmfest-debate-after-ettinger-tests-positive-for-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problem solver</a>” who will get things done, but that has left the diehard-conservative lane wide open for Munson, who is known as an <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/national/2022/05/jeremy-munson-could-be-the-next-republican-congressman-from-minnesotas-1st-district-why-are-so-many-republicans-trying-to-stop-that-from-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-establishment hardliner</a> in the state legislature and would likely join the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/house-freedom-caucus-head-spurns-congressional-widow-for-rival-gop-candidate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Caucus</a> if elected to Congress.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> Governor, attorney general</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Multiple Republicans are also jockeying for the chance to take out two vulnerable statewide Democrats in the Badger State — and Gov. Tony Evers tops their target list. Almost a year ago, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/09/09/rebecca-kleefisch-announces-run-wisconsin-governor-law-and-order-agenda-would-ban-sanctuary-cities/5754503001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the race</a> for <strong>governor</strong> with the support of her old boss, <a href="https://www.wpr.org/scott-walker-rebecca-kleefisch-would-make-hell-great-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Gov. Scott Walker</a>, and immediately catapulted to the <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MLSP68Toplines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top of the Republican field</a>. But then, in April, construction executive Tim Michels announced his own bid, and thanks to the sheer amount of <a href="https://www.wpr.org/republican-tim-michels-spends-nearly-8m-his-campaign-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">money</a> he’s pumped into his campaign — nearly $11 million as of July 25 — he’s emerged as a formidable foe to Kleefisch. Moreover, Michels got a further boost when, on June 2, he received the coveted endorsement of <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/06/02/donald-trump-endorses-tim-michels-wisconsin-governor/7488047001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump</a>. As a result, by mid-June, a <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MLSP70Toplines.html#Q44a:_Rep_primary_for_Gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marquette University poll</a> showed a virtually tied race: Michels 27 percent, Kleefisch 26 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s the most recent independent poll we have of the primary, which is particularly unfortunate given that businessman Kevin Nicholson, the third-place candidate in the race (10 percent in the Marquette poll), <a href="https://www.wpr.org/republican-kevin-nicholson-suspends-campaign-wisconsin-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended his campaign</a> in early July. Since then, we’ve gotten only an <a href="https://twitter.com/politicoalex/status/1550169733806399493?s=20&amp;t=5YWvSB8-Neico4DVaKG-ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal poll</a> from a super PAC that supports Michels. It gave Michels an 8-percentage-point lead, but remember that internal polls often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exaggerate the strength</a> of their preferred candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In recent weeks, many onetime and current Trump allies have broken with the ex-president and endorsed Kleefisch, such as <a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/mike-pence-touts-wisconsin-gop-governor-candidate-rebecca-kleefisch/article_1d22cadb-02fd-539d-ba00-3ce26ec7dc3d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Vice President Mike Pence</a> and <a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ted-cruz-endorses-rebecca-kleefisch-leading-up-to-gop-gubernatorial-primary/article_6762a356-39f7-5af5-9c92-c4521e5f9461.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Ted Cruz</a>. But the ideological fault lines in this primary may be the opposite of what you’d expect. While Kleefisch does have ties to the party establishment, she has claimed that the 2020 election in Wisconsin was “<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/27/rebecca-kleefisch-says-2020-election-rigged-compares-deflategate/9551852002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rigged</a>,” while the outsider Michels has been <a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/michels-unsure-if-2020-election-was-stolen-says-hes-focused-on-2022-after-winning-trump-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coyer on the subject</a>, saying he doesn’t know whether the election was stolen and that it is time to move on. He also <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/05/25/governor-candidate-tim-michels-reverses-course-elections-commission/9922775002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially resisted</a> abolishing the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, which most pro-Trump Republicans (including the other candidates for governor) want to do because they blame it for President Biden’s victory in the state (though Michels eventually came around to the idea of eliminating it). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For what it’s worth, a few Trump true believers, such as his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, have <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/12/trump-backed-conspiracy-theorist-tim-ramthun-enters-race-for-governor/6750802001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed another candidate</a>, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun, who has centered his campaign on decertifying the 2020 election in Wisconsin. However, he is clocking in only the single digits in the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other major Democratic incumbent that Republicans are hoping to beat is <strong>Attorney General</strong> Josh Kaul, who has said that he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-wisconsin-431bdc117a5ca8a9608d1ba8250f6084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will not enforce the state’s 1849 abortion ban</a> and is <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2022/06/28/kaul-files-lawsuit-challenging-1849-abortion-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suing to have it effectively overturned</a>. By contrast, the two main Republicans seeking to challenge him, former state Assembly member Adam Jarchow and Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney, have both said they would <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/14/wisconsin-attorney-general-election-candidates-abortion-law-after-roe-v-wade-overturned/7755800001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enforce the ban</a>. There are no public polls of the GOP primary, but Jarchow outraised Toney by about <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0105531FallPre-Primary20225f3d581202263005PMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$542,000</a> to nearly <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0106408FallPre-Primary20224d0b281202290740PMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$113,000</a> between Jan. 1 and July 25.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A third Republican candidate, attorney Karen Mueller, has focused her campaign more on <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/03/31/attorney-who-backs-election-decertification-ivermectin-enters-ag-race/7209427001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coronavirus- and election-related conspiracy theories</a>, saying she would investigate hospitals whose doctors refused to administer the antiparasitic drug ivermectin to COVID-19 patients and that the 2020 election should be decertified. However, her anemic fundraising (about <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0106511FallPre-Primary20222107f812022125135AMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$41,000</a> for the year) suggests she’s not a serious threat to win.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Politics doesn’t have a farm system in the way that professional baseball does. But it has a hierarchy of its own for cultivating political prospects. The path usually goes something like this: First, a candidate wins some relatively minor, local office like city council or state representative. Then, they either win a seat in the U.S. House or a statewide office like attorney general. Only then do they run for U.S. Senate or governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most of the Democrats running in competitive Senate and gubernatorial races have followed a version of this course. For instance, John Fetterman, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, was the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, for 13 years before being elected as the state’s lieutenant governor in 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But most of the Republicans haven’t. As a group, they have little experience running for office, and even less experience at actually <em>winning</em> general elections. Historically, such candidates have a poor track record — and in 2022 they could cost Republicans key gubernatorial races as well as control of the Senate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight’s model evaluates candidate experience as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of our “fundamentals” calculation</a>.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, our algorithm to predict race outcomes using factors other than polling, which we then combine with the polling average in each state to create a blended forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> Specifically, for Senate and gubernatorial candidates, we use a four-tiered system based on the candidate’s highest <em>elected</em><a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appointed offices don’t count&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> office:</p>



<ul><li>Tier 3: U.S. Senator or governor</li><li>Tier 2: U.S. representative or statewide elected office (e.g., secretary of state) or mayor of a large city</li><li>Tier 1: Any other nontrivial elected office (e.g., state senator)</li><li>Tier 0: Has never held any nontrivial elected office</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">The reason that experience in winning past elections can send a valuable statistical signal isn’t necessarily that experience in elected office is valuable unto itself. (For instance, candidates who are <em>appointed</em> to the U.S. Senate following a vacancy have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/appointed-senators-rarely-win-re/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor track records at winning a Senate term for themselves</a>.) Rather, it’s the act of <em>winning</em> an election that counts, since it’s a sign that a candidate is acceptable to some reasonably large group of voters.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have an average experience score of 2.5 in these races, and all the candidates they’ve nominated or are projected to nominate qualify in at least the second tier of experience. Republicans’ average experience rating is just 1.0, by contrast. That’s partly because they have fewer incumbents running, but even if you exclude incumbents from the average, there’s still a huge gap: non-incumbent Democrats have an average experience rating of 2.0 versus 0.5 for Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the Republican nominees for Senate in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania have never held elected office before. Nor has the party’s presumed nominee in New Hampshire, Donald Bolduc.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolduc &lt;a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1692&amp;amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;easily led the only poll of the GOP primary&lt;/a&gt; in New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having held elected office is not a prerequisite for higher office, and one can think of plenty of candidates, from Elizabeth Warren to Ted Cruz, who won races for the U.S. Senate as first-time candidates. Even so, some of them had pedigrees in politics or politics-related fields. Cruz had been solicitor general of Texas, for instance — an unelected office but one that gave him a significant public profile. Mark Kelly, the Democratic incumbent in Arizona, won a Senate race in his first election in 2020, but he had been an astronaut (often a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut-politician#:~:text=In%201985%2C%20Senator%20Jake%20Garn,also%20as%20a%20payload%20specialist." target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful launching pad for political careers</a>) and is the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year’s crop of Republican nominees doesn’t have those advantages. For instance, Democrats have a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/opinion/blake-masters-arizona-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">variety of potential attack lines against Blake Masters</a>, the newly minted Republican Senate nominee in Arizona, from his ties to controversial billionaire Peter Thiel to his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-gop-senate-candidate-masters-privatizing-social-security-2022-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggestions that he might privatize Social Security</a>. Ohio’s J.D. Vance has <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/07/do-new-fundraising-numbers-in-ohios-us-senate-race-between-jd-vance-and-tim-ryan-provide-a-ray-of-hope-for-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had trouble raising money</a>, a sign that he may lack the donor networks of more experienced politicians. Pennsylvania’s Mehmet Oz has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fallen well behind in polls</a> as he has been unable to fend off Fetterman attack ads that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/27/fetterman-ad-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasize his New Jersey residency</a>.<br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How about gubernatorial races? Here are the experience ratings in elections for competitive gubernatorial seats:<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus Michigan, which falls just outside the range that the FiveThirtyEight model considers competitive but is competitive according to &lt;a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;most other sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">You can see another big gap there: Democrats have an average experience rating of 2.4, as compared to 1.4 for Republicans. Excluding incumbents, Democrats have an average rating of 1.7, versus 1.0 for Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s important to note that we shouldn’t regard this as some sort of unlucky fluke for the GOP. Rather, this is part and parcel of the modern Republican Party. Former President Donald Trump didn’t have much political experience when he ran against the party establishment in 2016. Since then he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/opinion/liz-cheney-trump-jan-6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly intervened against candidates</a> who he thought were insufficiently loyal to him, regardless of their political pedigrees.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, there are Republicans who challenge Trump — like <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/26/sununu-bucks-trump-in-2024-00027612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu</a>. But that’s a case in point: Sununu <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/09/sununu-wont-run-for-senate-520413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose not to run for the U.S. Senate</a>. That seat is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-hampshire-is-tiny-and-pretty-weird-that-could-help-maggie-hassan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now pretty likely</a> to be retained by the Democratic incumbent, Maggie Hassan, since she’s likely to be running against an inexperienced Bolduc.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, Democratic chances to keep the Senate continue to inch upward and are now <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/?cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59 percent according to our Deluxe forecast</a> and 71 percent in the Classic version of our model. First-time candidates like Oz, Masters and Georgia’s Herschel Walker could blow races that Republicans would ordinarily be poised to win.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">U.S. health officials <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/us-declares-public-health-emergency-on-monkeypox-to-access-funds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared monkeypox a public health emergency</a> on Thursday, a move that frees up additional resources for vaccines and other treatments to help control the virus’s outbreak. The federal announcement comes just days after California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker both <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/california-governor-declares-monkeypox-state-emergency-87774929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared public health emergencies</a> in their respective states. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A number of states</a> have reported an uptick in monkeypox cases. The virus — which was recently detected in the U.S. <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/key-questions-about-the-current-u-s-monkeypox-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in mid-May</a> but came to the country at least once before, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5227a5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2003</a> — has led to mild outbreaks across the U.S., with areas like New York, Washington, D.C., and Florida <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/07/18/monkeypox-dc-vaccine-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bearing some of the highest case rates</a> by population. But according to recent polling, a majority of Americans aren’t paying close attention to the disease and aren’t that concerned about the outbreaks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Per a May survey from <a href="https://civicscience.com/concern-about-being-in-public-on-the-rise-but-not-due-to-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CivicScience</a>, 36 percent of U.S. adults said they were “somewhat concerned” with the spread of monkeypox in the country, versus 45 percent who were “not at all concerned.” Moreover, the percentage of Americans who told CivicScience that they were not at all worried about being in public places has significantly increased this year, from 29 percent in early January to 41 percent in late May. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The lack of concern could be, in part, because a majority of Americans aren’t paying particular attention to news regarding the outbreak. A May survey from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/pxr4um0yc2/20220528_econtoplines_revised.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a>, for instance, found that only 11 percent of respondents were following updates regarding monkeypox very closely. Thirty-three percent said they were paying attention to a certain extent, but the bulk of Americans (56 percent) said they weren’t following the news very closely — if at all. Those numbers haven’t increased significantly either, despite an uptick in cases <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/video/as-monkeypox-spreads-heres-how-to-stay-safe-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the summer</a>. A July poll from <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/survey-1-in-5-americans-fear-getting-monkeypox-but-many-know-little-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania</a> found that just 19 percent of Americans were concerned about getting monkeypox over the next several months. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that worries regarding the virus could change following the federal government’s latest announcement. But there’s still <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/07/researchers-monkeypox-00037620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot we don’t know</a> about the outbreak, and that lack of knowledge among experts could also be a reason why Americans seem largely unaware of how contagious the virus is and whether there’s a vaccine available. In July, just before New York’s Department of Health declared monkeypox <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2022/2022-07-28_monkeypox_virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an imminent threat to public health</a>, the same Annenberg Public Policy Center poll found that nearly half (48 percent) of Americans were unsure whether monkeypox was more contagious than COVID-19 (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/monkeypox-virus-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not</a>). Another 66 percent of respondents said they either didn’t know or didn’t believe there was a monkeypox vaccine (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/considerations-for-monkeypox-vaccination.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Concern about the virus might also be low because there’s a stigma associated with it. So far, the outbreak appears to mostly affect <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2207323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gay and bisexual men</a>. On the one hand, this means public health systems have been able to <a href="https://theconversation.com/monkeypox-an-expert-explains-what-gay-and-bisexual-men-need-to-know-187882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target their messaging</a> to the communities that appear most at risk. But that also carries the risk of villainizing these populations <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-has-led-to-an-uptick-in-anti-asian-racism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar to how Asian Americans</a> were targeted at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. There’s also an ongoing effort to change the name of the virus amid criticism that its current moniker is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/15/1105188732/monkeypox-new-name-who-world-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discriminatory and stigmatizing</a> and that it <a href="https://virological.org/t/urgent-need-for-a-non-discriminatory-and-non-stigmatizing-nomenclature-for-monkeypox-virus/853" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unfairly associates transmission of the disease</a> with Central and West Africa, despite the current international outbreak having no central connections to those regions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, it’s dangerous for Americans to presume that monkeypox poses a threat <em>only </em>to men who have sex with men. To be sure, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/0509-monkeypox-transmission.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is not an airborne virus</a> and is not as easy to contract as, say, COVID-19. (It also cannot be easily passed through casual skin contact, is not as deadly COVID-19 and doesn’t usually lead to hospitalization.) But that <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/07/1123212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t mean other populations</a> aren’t at risk of contracting it or that monkeypox can’t eventually escalate into another pandemic given that the virus has seemingly become more transmissible this go-around. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unfortunately, at least for now, there’s just not enough data to know how bad the monkeypox outbreak might get. It’s why public health officials are asking everyone to remain vigilant while President Biden’s administration ramps up measures to combat it at the state and federal level. Public health officials are optimistic that the viral illness is not like COVID-19, but they are still advising everyone to exercise caution in situations where one can’t maintain a sense of personal space. Americans may be currently taking a lax attitude toward monkeypox, but in reality, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the disease.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Only about one-quarter of Americans report being “very” (8 percent) or “somewhat” concerned (18 percent) that President Biden’s recent COVID-19 diagnosis could inhibit the government from performing its duties, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/07/28/americans-reactions-president-biden-getting-covid">according to a YouGov poll conducted July 23-26</a>. That said, many Americans are broadly concerned that Biden’s age and health have adversely affected his capacity to perform presidential duties: Forty-two percent said these factors severely limited his ability to fulfill his role, while adults 65 and older (Biden’s own demographic) were the most likely of any age group (50 percent) to agree.</li><li>A majority of Americans (59 percent) don’t know the definition of “carbon-neutral,” <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/02/carbon-neutral-consumer-awareness/">per a July 26 survey from Morning Consult</a>. Thirty percent said they weren’t sure, while 29 percent incorrectly identified “carbon-neutral” from a list of three choices. Interestingly, that number is very similar for self-identified environmentalists: Twenty-four percent said they didn’t know, and 32 percent gave a wrong answer. </li><li>Adults 65 and older are almost twice as likely (51 percent) as adults under 30 (27 percent) to write by hand every day, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/survey-results/daily/2022/08/03/a16cd/1">according to an Aug. 3 YouGov survey</a>. It’s a habit that varies by race, too: Forty-six percent of white Americans reported handwriting daily, compared to 33 percent of Black Americans and 34 percent of Hispanic Americans. </li><li>Younger Americans are less likely than older Americans to have read books as children, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/entertainment/articles-reports/2022/07/29/books-americans-read-growing-up-and-now">per a July 19-22 YouGov survey</a>. Seventy-nine percent of Americans under the age of 30 reported reading while growing up, compared with 95 percent of adults 65 and older.

<p data-paragraph="main">This past spring, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott captured headlines for his plan to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/06/greg-abbott-texas-border-title-42/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bus migrants to Washington, D.C.</a> He said he was concerned that there would be an influx of migrants crossing the state’s border with Mexico in light of President Biden’s decision to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-administration-lift-title-42-restrictions-southern-border/story?id=83814418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cease a public-health order</a> from 2020 authorizing federal officials to turn away migrants at the border — even those seeking asylum. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many, including the Biden administration, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/migrants-arrive-dc-buses-sent-gop-texas-gov-greg-abbott-rcna24229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chalked up Abbott’s actions to a publicity stunt</a>. After all, illegal immigration is something that has long motivated Republican voters, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>especially</em> when a Democrat is in the White House</a>. The fact, though, that so much attention is paid to illegal immigration misses how the debate on immigration policy is changing in the U.S. — namely, Republican politicians are increasingly blurring the lines between illegal and legal immigration and targeting not just illegal immigration, but legal immigration too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past two decades, support for increasing legal immigration has climbed steadily overall, although Democrats have primarily driven that uptick, as the chart below shows. In fact, per <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/report_republicans-democrats-different-worlds-on-immigration_20191008.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 polling from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs</a>, Republicans are not only less likely to support increasing legal immigration but also more likely to support reducing legal immigration. Almost half of Republicans (47 percent) said legal immigration should be decreased, compared with just 16 percent of Democrats. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1016" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zoha.IMMIGRATION.0804.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zoha.IMMIGRATION.0804.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zoha.IMMIGRATION.0804.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zoha.IMMIGRATION.0804.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="2000" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zoha.IMMIGRATION.mobile.0804.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zoha.IMMIGRATION.mobile.0804.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zoha.IMMIGRATION.mobile.0804.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zoha.IMMIGRATION.mobile.0804.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The distinction between legal immigration and illegal immigration is often not clear-cut, though. Consider that only a minority of unauthorized immigrants, 38 percent, entered the country without proper documentation in 2016, <a href="https://cmsny.org/publications/essay-2017-undocumented-and-overstays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to research conducted by the Center for Migration Studies</a>. Instead, the majority of unauthorized immigrants who entered the U.S. that year, 62 percent, overstayed their temporary visas, meaning they initially arrived in the U.S. legally but proceeded to remain illegally with expired paperwork. Moreover, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/13/key-facts-about-the-changing-u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-population/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pew Research Center</a> looked at <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/08/07/dhs-releases-fiscal-year-2017-entryexit-overstay-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 data from the Department of Homeland Security</a> and found that almost 90 percent of those who overstayed their visas were from neither Mexico nor Central America. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless, this doesn’t change the fact that a lot of <a href="https://niemanreports.org/articles/immigration-news-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media attention remains focused on illegal immigration</a>, especially in the context of the southern border. Republicans are also still probably more concerned over illegal immigration than over legal immigration. When Gallup asked Americans in March <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391820/four-americans-highly-concerned-illegal-immigration.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how personally worried they were about illegal immigration</a>, 68 percent of Republicans said “a great deal” — 27 percentage points higher than the overall share of Americans who said they were worried a great deal and 50 points higher than the share of Democrats who said the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s this overwhelming concern around illegal immigration — regardless of its accuracy — that helps explain why Republican politicians still give the topic so much oxygen in their campaign materials. They know illegal immigration is a huge flash point for their voters — at the very least, this is something I’ve found in researching the platforms of various Republican primary candidates running for state and federal office. And yet, I’ve also found that when you look at the actual immigration policies Republican politicians have successfully enacted, efforts to curb legal immigration have been much more successful than policies meant to restrict illegal immigration.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take former President Donald Trump. While illegal immigration was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-clinton-comparing-stances-immigration-reform/story?id=41799971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a central pillar of his campaign</a>, especially in 2016, his administration proved much more adept at implementing policies that limited legal immigration than illegal immigration. A week after he took office, he <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-refugee-immigration-ban-recalls-past-exclusionary-laws/story?id=45046605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notoriously signed an executive order</a> that initially limited immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. Moreover, throughout his four years in office, Trump also pursued a number of measures to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-issues-rule-asylum-seekers-central-american/story?id=64339378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uproot the process for asylum seekers</a>, from banning certain situations in which people were eligible for asylum to introducing new protocols that made the asylum process longer. And later, the coronavirus pandemic unleashed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/authorities-enforce-trumps-coronavirus-travel-restrictions-us-airports/story?id=69580793" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of travel restrictions</a> from the Trump administration in early 2020 that contributed to an <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/president-trump-reduced-legal-immigration-he-did-not-reduce-illegal-immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 percent decrease in the average number of monthly green cards</a> and a <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/president-trump-reduced-legal-immigration-he-did-not-reduce-illegal-immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28 percent decrease in non-immigrant visas</a> compared with President Barack Obama’s second term. Meanwhile, Trump’s early campaign <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-unveils-immigration-plan-calls-end-birthright/story?id=33114832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promises to collect and deport all undocumented immigrants</a> never panned out, and his infamous wall — at least how he envisioned it — has yet to be built. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s policies may present obvious examples, but the former president is not the only one proposing policies that limit legal immigration. Republicans in Congress have also started to take up legislation that whittles down such pathways. For instance, when Republicans controlled the Senate in 2019, Sens. Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley and then-Sen. David Perdue reintroduced <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-cotton-perdue-and-hawley-re-introduce-the-reforming-american-immigration-for-a-strong-economy-act-raise-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the RAISE Act</a>, which proposed restricting family-based immigration policies in addition to instituting a host of other caps. (An earlier version, which specifically outlined <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/raise-act-dramatic-change-family-immigration-less-so-employment-based-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halving the number of green cards</a> issued annually, had previously failed to come to a vote in 2017, when Cotton and Perdue first proposed it.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bill also explicitly linked legal immigration to the economy with its focus on highly skilled immigrants, which it defined as immigrants who could help with “<a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/RAISE%20Act_116th%20Congress_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improving the fiscal health of the United States</a>” without jeopardizing jobs that could otherwise be held by American citizens or as “protecting or increasing the wages of working Americans.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of race and ethnicity research at Pew, told me that America’s immigrant population has changed significantly since the 1980s and 1990s, which in turn, has influenced immigration policy debates. Lopez said that for a long time, immigration policy focused on security at the border and illegal immigration but that “now it’s also about employers, student visas [and] attracting certain workers in agriculture or tech.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the three senators’ legislation had Trump’s backing, the bill did not pass. But notably, evidence suggests that at least some parts of the idea were popular among Republicans. For instance, 42 percent of Republicans, including those who lean Republican, told Pew in a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/10/a-majority-of-americans-say-immigrants-mostly-fill-jobs-u-s-citizens-do-not-want/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 survey</a> that immigrants living legally in the U.S. mostly fill jobs that U.S. citizens would want to take on, which was 10 points higher than the share of Americans overall who said the same.</p>

Vance, Ohio’s GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate, has embraced the anti-immigration rhetoric of former President Donald Trump. <p>Eli Hiller / Bloomberg / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to the 2022 midterms and 2024 presidential election, both legal and illegal immigration continue to be important Republican talking points with a number of high-profile GOP figures — from Abbott to GOP Senate nominees like J.D. Vance and 2024 aspirants like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-immigration-business-campaigns-presidential-elections-f6e52e26f6a164b2f9299bbaced7e79e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Vice President Mike Pence</a> — doubling down on immigration in their campaign rhetoric and platforms. And it’s once again a blurring of messages, with legal and illegal immigration often used interchangeably and Mexico blamed as the source of all illegal immigration. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, Vance, Trump’s endorsee for Ohio’s open Senate seat, <a href="https://jdvance.com/issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buckets all of his immigration policy</a> — legal and illegal — under “Solve Southern Border Crisis” on his campaign website. He also has leaned into especially inflammatory rhetoric, <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1511311385543815180?s=20&amp;t=tEvCGX2E3KV-QZLmiqLDPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running an ad</a> ahead of his primary in which he asked voters: “Are you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans?” as a way to suggest it is the media responsible for such perceptions — although in the same ad, Vance said immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border were primarily responsible for illegal drugs “pouring into the country.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Katie Britt, another Trump endorsee who won the Republican nomination for Alabama’s Senate race, splits up legal and illegal immigration in her <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1azZVGgDKFXhyBOibWxJdGa-PAejuxFVg/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign materials</a> — at least more so than Vance, but she still often muddles the two by suggesting, for example, that all visa issues fall under legal immigration reform and by treating Mexico as the primary source for illegal immigration in the U.S. Moreover, Britt also calls for reducing legal immigration and blames a major immigration bill from 1965 that ended discriminatory practices, like regional immigration preferences and quotas, as responsible for driving down the wages of Alabamians. This is notable, because it marks <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/immigration-1965-law-donald-trump-gop-214179/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a huge shift</a> in how GOP politicians have historically talked about legal immigration.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pence, who has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/potential-rivals-make-moves-light-trumps-weak-spots/story?id=87134612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not-so-secret 2024 ambitions</a>, has also talked about immigration in recent speeches. Notably, too, despite having had a fraught relationship with Trump since the end of their term, Pence <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2022/06/14/mike-pence-return-trump-era-immigration-policies-phoenix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said in a speech in Arizona that he supported</a> curbing family-based migration — or the legal framework that allows American citizens to sponsor visas for extended family members — while also championing a crackdown on illegal immigration at the southern border. Other presidential hopefuls who, similar to Pence, aren’t fully in Trump’s inner circle have also made immigration a part of their pitch, <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkihaley/status/1333887220265193476" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley</a>. While those more squarely in Trump’s orbit, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, continue to lean into <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/07/28/desantis-touted-effort-to-combat-illegal-immigration-most-arrests-were-legal-residents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the illegal immigration rhetoric</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As The Washington Post’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/03/trump-republican-primary-rivals-desantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Byler noted on Wednesday</a>, how Republicans talk about immigration has changed dramatically post-Trump, and that’s made it harder to distinguish the differences between legal and illegal immigration, which, in turn, has obscured the nuances of immigration issues. As Lopez told me, the immigrant population in the U.S. is just really diverse, with a lot of different components comprising legal immigration versus illegal immigration. “These broad umbrellas are helpful in some ways to think about broad categories,” he said. “But there’s so much diversity within each one that they end up masking a lot of what is happening around immigration policy, as well as the experiences of people who come to the U.S. as immigrants navigating either one of these pathways.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Voters in Kansas rejected a constitutional amendment by 59 percent to 41 percent on Tuesday that would have ended state constitutional rights to abortion. It was the first statewide vote on abortion since the Dobbs decision in June and marks a significant win for abortion-rights advocates in a conservative state. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses why the amendment failed by such a wide margin and whether the issue of abortion will motivate voters in other elections this fall. The team also looks at the primary winners in Arizona, Missouri, Michigan and Washington to get a better sense of the kinds of messages that are potent in both parties.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, we got our first test of how potent an issue abortion might be for Democrats this fall. In a state that overwhelmingly voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020, a ballot initiative clarifying that Kansas’s state constitution does in fact protect abortion <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kansas-abortion-amendment-vote-bellwether-post-roe-era/story?id=87384933" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won by double digits</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s going on?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, public opinion on whether abortions should generally be legal or illegal hasn’t changed much since the Supreme Court decided in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a> to end the constitutional right to abortion earlier this summer. In fact, <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;sumTotals=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daily tracking polls from Civiqs show</a> that the share of registered voters who think abortion should be legal has held steady at 57-58 percent throughout the past year — even though there have been mounting restrictions on reproductive rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the relative stability of the topline numbers masks significant changes in the scenarios under which Democrats, independents and Republicans now think that abortion should be permitted or banned — shifts that speak in part to why abortion is becoming such a powerful wedge issue for the Democratic Party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For starters, there is evidence that Democrats are gravitating toward supporting unfettered abortion rights. In the chart below, you can see that Democrats polled by Civiqs were once evenly divided over whether abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances. But Democrats who think abortion should always be legal now outnumber their counterparts who say it should be mostly legal by a nearly two-to-one margin (59 percent to 32 percent). </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Democrats increasingly think abortion should always be legal" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gehgK/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The same uptick appears in a slightly different question from <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/economist/survey-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly tracking surveys by YouGov/The Economist</a>. Shortly before a draft of the Dobbs decision was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked and obtained by Politico</a> in early May, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/v29gmo3oqg/econTabReport%20%282%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 42 percent of voters who cast their ballots for President Biden</a> in 2020 agreed with the following statement: “Abortion should always be legal. There should be no restrictions on abortion.”<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April 9-12 survey was the last time YouGov/The Economist asked about the scenarios in which abortion should be legal or illegal before the leaked decision on Dobbs was published on May 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> But that share has now <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/d1ik3gw9iw/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown</a> to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/ldb835m1bk/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between 49 percent and 54 percent</a> in <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/k4maehoie4/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all six</a> of the surveys <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/0atxy0xx1u/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a> conducted since <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/0atxy0xx1u/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court</a> overturned <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/8gvsd6ko1j/20220625_econTabReport_revised.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roe v. Wade</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just Democrats either. Independents are also moving toward supporting unrestricted abortion access. The share of unaffiliated voters who think abortion should be legal in all cases has increased by 5 percentage points over the past year<a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Independent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> in <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Independent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civiqs’s daily tracking poll</a>, while the data from YouGov/The Economist reveals an even sharper surge. Just 17 percent of independents thought there should be no restrictions on abortion in the April 9-12 YouGov/The Economist poll, but in the six weekly surveys they conducted since Dobbs became the law of the land, that number among independents has climbed to an average of 29 percent.      </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-court-dealt-big-blow-separation-church-state-85886797</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, there isn’t a huge shift in the share of Republicans saying abortion should be legal in all circumstances, but they are increasingly likely to say that abortion should be legal in most circumstances. What’s more, the share of Republicans who said abortion should be illegal in all cases has decreased from 24 percent in February to a record low of 18 percent<a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> in <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civiqs’s daily tracking poll</a>. That said, a majority of Republicans, 59 percent, still think abortion should be illegal in most cases.    </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, though, the shift in attitudes on abortion post-Dobbs increasingly favors Democrats. Indeed, one reason abortion is becoming such a potent wedge issue for the party is that it increasingly unites its base, and independents are also closer to Democrats on this issue than Republicans, as you can see in the chart below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1410" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tesler.ABORTION-DEMS.0804-2.png" alt="A bubble chart showing the share of Democrats, independents and Republicans who believe one of four stances on abortion: It should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases or illegal in all cases." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tesler.ABORTION-DEMS.0804-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tesler.ABORTION-DEMS.0804-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tesler.ABORTION-DEMS.0804-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1094" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tesler.ABORTION-DEMS.0804-2-mob.png" alt="A bubble chart showing the share of Democrats, independents and Republicans who believe one of four stances on abortion: It should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases or illegal in all cases." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tesler.ABORTION-DEMS.0804-2-mob.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tesler.ABORTION-DEMS.0804-2-mob.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tesler.ABORTION-DEMS.0804-2-mob.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Even in a dark-red state like Kansas, far more registered voters support abortion always being legal than support it always being illegal (by 25 percent to 11 percent, respectively, in <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;home_state=Kansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civiqs’s state polling data</a>). That’s presumably, in part, at least one reason why the Kansas ballot initiative that tried to open a pathway to restricting abortions in the state was decisively defeated on Tuesday. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that Democrats are also now more likely than Republicans to rate abortion as an important issue is a big factor here, too, that’s working in the Democrats’ favor. Up until recently, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to rate abortion as a “very important” issue. This abruptly changed, though, after the Supreme Court decided not to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block Texas’s abortion law</a> that banned most abortions once an ultrasound could detect cardiac activity, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy, from taking effect on Sept. 1, 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the chart below shows that since then, Democratic voters have consistently rated abortion as more important than GOP voters have. The share of Biden and Trump voters who think abortion is “very important” has diverged even more sharply after both the Dobbs leak in early May and the Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in late June — so much so that Biden voters are now over 20 points more likely than Trump voters to say that abortion is “very important.”</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These results are consistent with a long line of political science research that shows how <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00384.x?casa_token=YA_eYB9Q_zcAAAAA:8uXr0t0QkTJYWPgMma8zU-kNA0Y385PUTcsLpn_X1v935a63939B9C4KGVwmmrM3co7q3tffPsbewuew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threats</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/anger-gap/967D469A566F389E0C69099BA5486069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anger</a> are often more motivating when it comes to people taking political action. They also dovetail nicely <a href="http://www.chriswarshaw.com/papers/AAPOR_presentation_initiatives.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with more recent research</a> on how the public reacts negatively to changes to the status quo. In fact, negative reactions to unpopular policy changes may have even affected two of the past three midterm-election outcomes, as threats to the health care status quo <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09615-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped Democrats in 2018</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X11433768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurt them back in 2010</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abortion has all the elements, then, of a particularly potent wedge issue for the Democratic Party. Democrats are increasingly unified and motivated to return to the status quo of legal abortions under Roe — a constitutional right that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-the-first-time-in-years-democrats-are-more-concerned-about-abortion-than-republicans-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Americans had long taken for granted</a>. Republicans, meanwhile, are more divided and demobilized by an issue that has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/10/18295513/abortion-2020-roe-joe-biden-democrats-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically rallied its base</a>. And independents are closer to Democrats on abortion, especially in states where Republican lawmakers have passed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/15/abortion-exceptions-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly unpopular abortion bans</a> without exceptions for rape and incest.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, none of this changes the fact that Democrats face an uphill battle in November. Republicans, after all, are still a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy favorite</a> to win a majority of seats in the House. Yet, as FiveThirtyEight editor-and-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last week</a>, the political environment for Democrats has improved since the Dobbs decision. And that might mitigate the landslide midterm losses <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normally expected</a> from a congressional majority weighed down by <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-economy-grew-modestly-quarter-87540108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative economic growth</a> and the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unprecedented disapproval</a> of the incumbent party’s president at this point in his term. Regardless of this year’s election outcomes, though, the trends above clearly suggest that abortion will continue to be an effective wedge issue for the Democratic Party moving forward.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to think of an issue on which public opinion in the United States has changed as completely and rapidly as it has on same-sex marriage. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393197/same-sex-marriage-support-inches-new-high.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup began tracking the issue in 1996</a>, support was at about 27 percent, with <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1651/gay-lesbian-rights.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68 percent opposed</a>. As of May, however, 71 percent supported same-sex marriage with just 28 percent opposed (1 percent had no opinion).</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Most Americans now support same-sex marriage" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MyPKM/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It is, in other words, a complete reversal in public opinion in just one generation. Meanwhile, opinion on abortion, another right that challenges how people view sex, religion, gender and gender roles, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/Abortion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has hardly budged</a>. Or at least <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this was true</a> before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in the recent Dobbs v. Jackson decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The rapid embrace of these rights really is fairly unprecedented,” said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute. But while almost every group of Americans — across ages, race and ethnicity and party identification — now supports the right of same-sex couples to marry, there’s one group that doesn’t: white evangelicals, especially those who go to church every week. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for same-sex marriage has grown over the years among white evangelicals, but a majority remains opposed. More recent trends suggest that support among this group has stalled — and may even be reversing — which is significant at a time when <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/27/1113890039/same-sex-marriage-bill-senate-tammy-baldwin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress is considering whether to codify same-sex marriage into law</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A federal <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/house-vote-sex-marriage-push-back-court-87047766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same-sex marriage bill passed the House</a> last month and is supported by all Democrats in Congress. Forty-seven Republicans <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/house-vote-sex-marriage-push-back-court-87047766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for the bill</a> in the House, and so far <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/politics/gop-senators-same-sex-marriage/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five Republican senators</a> — Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin — have said they support it; eight GOP senators are firm noes; and the remaining 37 haven’t said one way or another. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-marriage-congress-government-and-politics-b500cb024ea5776c4e8ebca228c22480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to bring the bill to the floor</a>, but last week, Collins told reporters that Schumer and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/collins-same-sex-marriage_n_62e2d05ae4b0d0ea9b751b87" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise deal</a> to include climate-change legislation in the Democrats’ reconciliation bill might now doom bipartisan efforts around same-sex marriage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a far simpler reason Republicans might ultimately decide not to take up the bill: It goes against what many white evangelicals want, and white evangelicals remain an important and influential part of the Republican Party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider that evangelical institutions are already urging Republicans not to vote in favor of the bill. On July 26, 83 religious and right-wing groups <a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/McConnellCoalitionLetterRFMA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a letter</a> to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saying the act “is an attack on millions of Americans, particularly people of faith, who believe marriage is between one man and one woman and that legitimate distinctions exist between men and women concerning family formation that should be recognized in the law.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This argument, that recognizing the rights of others is an infringement on one’s own religious liberty, is a familiar one, especially in the years since the Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal across the country in 2015. Andrew Lewis, a professor in political science at the University of Cincinnati, said that after the verdict in Obergefell v. Hodges, opponents of same-sex marriage lost the argument over whether same-sex marriage should be legal and shifted the discussion. “It's less about the substance of marriage equality and more about what they see as the harm to dissenting opinions,” Lewis said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The vast majority of white evangelicals, 60 percent, think that someone should be able to refuse service to a same-sex couple if doing otherwise goes against that person’s religion, according to <a href="https://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/PRRI-Mar-2022-LGBTQ-AVA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRRI’s latest annual American Values Atlas</a>, from 2021, which surveys more than 20,000 total respondents. And that share is a bit higher, 68 percent, for white evangelicals who attend church regularly. Most Americans don’t agree — 66 percent in that PRRI survey said someone shouldn’t be able to refuse service on religious grounds. But that is lower than the 79 percent who say they favor laws preventing discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community, suggesting some tension between support for anti-discrimination laws and arguments in favor of religious liberty.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s why evangelicals’ criticisms of same-sex marriage are now often framed as an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/02/28/517092031/in-religious-freedom-debate-2-american-values-clash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infringement on their religious freedoms</a>. It’s a more palatable argument, Lewis told me, than saying marriage should be restricted to a man and a woman.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, issues of religious liberty fuel some businesses’ decisions to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/us/when-businesses-can-deny-you-service-trnd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refuse service to same-sex couples</a> and have led to numerous court cases challenging anti-discrimination laws, including one that the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/us/colorado-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to take up</a> next term. Newer efforts to limit the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans, like Florida’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-battles-federal-lgbtq-protections/story?id=87637743" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parental rights’ law</a> that critics dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, also fall under this broader religious-liberty umbrella — even if the coalition pushing them is broader than just evangelicals. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Florida’s law prohibits sexual orientation and gender identity education from being taught in kindergarten through third grade in public schools, based on the idea that such education is a parent’s job, and gives parents the right to sue districts they believe are violating the law. At least 13 other states <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/10/1091543359/15-states-dont-say-gay-anti-transgender-bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are considering similar laws</a>. Laws targeting transgender people are also taking hold in many of the same states, which are largely those with the <a href="https://ava.prri.org/#lgbt/2021/States/lgbt_ssm/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatest shares of people opposed</a> to same-sex marriage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These laws mobilize white evangelical Christians and help explain the hesitancy of some Republican senators to get on board. “They are the most important part of the Republican Party,” Lewis said. “They bring in new candidates, they turn people out to vote, their issues are at the center of the Republican nomination fights.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the PRRI atlas, only 35 percent of white evangelical Protestants now support the right of same-sex couples to marry. That’s a dip, too, from the previous year’s survey, taken in 2020, <a href="https://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PRRI-Mar-2021-LGBTQ.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when 43 percent said they supported same-sex marriage</a>. “My hunch is that this is in response to this sort of heightened political atmosphere of having in the news issues about LGBT rights,” Deckman, of PRRI, said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite that, the vast majority of Americans still support same-sex marriage, and one reason for that support cited by nearly everyone I spoke to is that LGBTQ+ Americans had already been fighting against discrimination in the decades leading up to the fight over same-sex marriage. As states began allowing same-sex couples to wed, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gaymarriage-states/factbox-list-of-states-that-legalized-gay-marriage-idUSBRE95P07A20130626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beginning with Massachusetts in 2003</a> and ending with the Obergefell decision, couples simply became more visible, settling into marriages, buying homes and having children in communities across the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Our opponents said, if we have same-sex marriage, all these parades of horribles will happen,” said David Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy and lobbying organization. “And those parades of horribles never came to pass.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, though, laws banning books from school libraries and banning LGBTQ+ education could reduce the kind of visibility and normalization that led to a rise in support for same-sex marriage in the first place. Jennifer Pizer, the acting chief legal officer for Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a group that advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, told me that because many of these laws aim to censor LGTBQ+ people, conversations that allowed LGTBQ+ people to show they’re not a threat are now more easily shut down. “The efforts to smear us are wrongheaded and really hurtful and should have no place in our society,” said Pizer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for same-sex marriage seemed a settled, popular shift in American society, too, until Justice Clarence Thomas <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in his concurring opinion</a> in the Dobbs case that the court “should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.” This sounded a warning to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/same-sex-couple-households.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 1 million couples in same-sex marriages</a> in the country, as overturning a popular precedent no longer seems impossible given the court just did that when it overturned Roe. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not clear where this fight will go next, but Stacy told me that the Human Rights Campaign thinks this might lead some state legislatures to try to challenge the decision. “Maybe indirectly, maybe more around religious exemptions, maybe allowing clerks to deny licenses,” he said. After all, groups that opposed abortion rights spent years changing state laws to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/01/14-states-have-passed-laws-making-it-harder-to-get-an-abortion-already-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenge Roe v. Wade</a>, chipping away at it so that even before it was overturned, abortion wasn’t always an easy right to access. Same-sex marriage opponents could follow the same playbook.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Happy primary day, Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Washington! To celebrate, we’re catching you up on all the races to watch on the ballot today. Yesterday <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-far-right-will-republican-primary-voters-go-in-arizona-and-missouri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we previewed Arizona’s and Missouri’s primaries</a>; today we tackle Kansas, Michigan and Washington,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio is just holding primaries for state legislature today, and we’re not watching any of those races especially closely. Sorry, Buckeyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> and look ahead to one interesting race in Tennessee’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/tennessee-primary-why-thursday-109808" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unusual Thursday primary</a>. Most notably, three Republican representatives who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump will presently learn whether they have retained the support of enough Republican voters to make the general election — arguably the biggest test of anti-Trumpism in a Republican primary to date. But that’s only a fraction of the action, so let’s go through everything state by state.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22188650886158-3X2.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22188650886158-3X2.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22188650886158-3X2.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22188650886158-3X2.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Conservative media personality Tudor Dixon is ahead of businessman Kevin Rinke in the polling of Michigan’s GOP gubernatorial primary. <p>Michael Buck / WOOD TV8 / AP</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Michigan</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 3rd, 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th congressional districts; governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Michigan’s race for <strong>governor</strong> is a test of what happens when a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-gop-could-make-or-break-its-chances-in-10-key-governors-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party’s leading candidates</a> fail to make the primary ballot, as <a href="https://www.wilx.com/2022/05/26/watch-live-state-board-canvassers-meet-discuss-sufficiency-signatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election authorities disqualified</a> former Detroit Police Chief James Craig and businessman Perry Johnson from the Republican primary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/us/politics/disqualified-michigan-governors-craig-johnson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of thousands of forged signatures</a> in their nominating petitions. GOP voters will now have to choose among conservative media personality Tudor Dixon, businessman Kevin Rinke, chiropractor Garrett Soldano and real estate broker Ryan Kelley — although Craig <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/05/craig-off-ballot-says-campaigns-not-over-im-not-going-let-go/7522415001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has mounted a write-in campaign</a>. The winner will face Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has already attracted speculation as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/09/gretchen-whitmer-profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential presidential candidate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the limited polling we have, Dixon <a href="https://www.michigannewssource.com/2022/07/exclusive-dixon-holds-strong-lead-in-new-poll-entering-final-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks to be the front-runner</a>, and the most recent <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/michigan-2022-trump-endorsement-clears-path-for-tudor-dixon-in-republican-gubernatorial-nomination-rinke-vote-melts-away%EF%BF%BC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Emerson College</a> suggests her advantage grew after Trump <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/29/trump-endorses-tudor-dixon-michigan-governor/10115243002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed her on Friday</a>. Emerson polled from Thursday through Saturday, and broke down how Trump’s support shifted the numbers: Dixon led Rinke 49 percent to 14 percent after the endorsement, a sizable uptick from her 39-percent-to-24-percent-edge beforehand.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures included respondents who leaned toward a candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> Before Trump’s entry, many big names in the Michigan GOP <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/26/gop-messiest-primary-michigan-00047790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had already lined up behind her</a>, too, including <a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/politics-government/2022-05-24/devos-family-endorses-tudor-dixon-for-michigan-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the powerful DeVos family</a>, led by Betsy DeVos, Trump’s former secretary of education. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Dixon’s opponents have tried to make strong appeals to the GOP base. Rinke <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/kevin-rinke-channels-trumps-business-outsider-label-mi-governors-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has portrayed himself</a> as an outsider, while Soldano <a href="https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/2022/07/26/michigan-gop-gubernatorial-candidates-make-pitch-voters-primary-election-nears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has called for an audit</a> of the 2020 election and <a href="https://twitter.com/GarrettForMI/status/1537212362008272897?s=20&amp;t=r5mHGYm1X96QF8DJMKKTNA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has promised to “restore” parental rights in schools</a>. And Kelley has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/ryan-kelley-was-arrested-role-jan-6-now-front-runner-michigans-gop-pri-rcna34817" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bragged about attending</a> the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — for which the FBI arrested him on a misdemeanor charge — as evidence of his devotion to Trump’s cause. In fact, Rinke and Soldano <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/22/rinke-loans-governor-campaign-10-m-dixon-scores-big-donors-gop-primary-nears/10128433002/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have actually outraised Dixon</a>, bringing in $10.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, compared with Dixon’s $1.7 million (Kelley has raised $307,000). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Dixon <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/pacs-backed-devos-others-spend-2m-ads-aid-tudor-dixon-records-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has benefited from</a> $2.6 million in spending by super PACs funded by her supporters, like DeVos, who <a href="https://vimeo.com/734376185" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has run ads defending Dixon</a> and highlighting Trump’s past praise for her. A group backed by the Democratic Governors Association <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/26/democrats-launch-ad-against-tudor-dixon-final-days-gop-primary-race/10159084002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also spent $2 million</a> on ads attacking Dixon, not boosting her, which is a contrast from the Democratic meddling <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-to-watch-in-the-maryland-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve seen in other GOP primaries</a> and suggests Michigan Democrats view her as a credible threat.</p>

Peter Meijer in the GOP primary in Michigan’s 3rd District. <p>Daniel Shular / The Grand Rapids Press / AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">However, we <em>have</em> seen Democratic meddling in the GOP primary for western Michigan’s <strong>3rd District,</strong> where Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/25/house-dems-meijer-gop-primary-00047750" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have aided</a> freshman Rep. Peter Meijer’s challenger, John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/politics/fact-check-john-gibbs-michigan-mathematically-impossible/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has backed Trump’s false claims</a> that the 2020 election result was fraudulent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meijer was one of the 10 Republicans who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-but-one-house-republican-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-faces-a-trump-endorsed-challenger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to impeach</a> Trump after the Jan. 6 attack, which earned Gibbs <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-congress-michigan-grand-rapids-impeachments-bfbb4564f73f2afdda6c5dbcb969c4ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a> last year, but until very recently, Gibbs <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MI03&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had received little outside support</a>. However, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting has made this district more competitive</a>, shifting it from R+9 to D+3, according to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric</a>,<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> and as a result, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cmte=DCCC&amp;cycle=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped $450,000</a> on ads <a href="https://youtu.be/x5XVRDC50Do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ostensibly attacking</a> Gibbs as “too conservative for west Michigan.” But this is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2022-07-13/essential-politics-democrats-buying-ads-gop-far-right-candidates-essential-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a well-worn ploy</a> designed to actually encourage GOP voters to back him.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats believe their candidate, attorney Hillary Scholten, can more easily defeat Gibbs than Meijer, <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2020GEN_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who beat Scholten</a> by 6 points under the old lines in 2020. But the DCCC’s actions <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/27/meijer-dccc-trump-primaries-00048104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infuriated congressional Democrats</a>, who criticized the committee — which is <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017f-dd21-d522-ab7f-dfb196280000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded in part by members’ dues</a> — for boosting an election denier against Meijer, the rare Republican who backed impeachment and <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/14/peter-meijer-michigan-gop-primary-trump-john-gibbs/7816445001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disputes Trump’s false election claims</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meijer, the scion of the eponymous Midwestern grocery chain family, is hoping his <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable financial advantage</a> can save him. As of July 13, Meijer had raised $2.8 million, dwarfing the $484,000 Gibbs had brought in, and Meijer has used that money to both <a href="https://youtu.be/hmndpMMgTrU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticize President Biden</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/UADOxOUCsgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack Gibbs</a>. Meijer has lambasted Gibbs for recently moving to western Michigan from California (although Gibbs <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/11/12/trump-staffer-gibbs-launches-campaign-congress-district-held-meijer/8592328002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is originally from Lansing</a>), and <a href="https://mycmag.kantarmediana.com/KMIcmagvidbin2/HOUSE_MI03_PRINCIPLEDLEADERSHIP_HANDPICKED.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s also portrayed Gibbs</a> as the Democrats’ “handpicked candidate” in light of the DCCC’s recent ads. Meijer has also <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/07/27/pac-boosting-meijer-in-primary-has-family-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefited from</a> about $3 million in outside spending, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MI03&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to OpenSecrets</a>. But with no recent polling to go on, Meijer’s fate in this race is unclear.</p>

Andy Levin has the backing of progressive groups and campaigned with Rep. Rashida Tlaib, but it’s not clear whether that will be enough for Levin to keep his seat: Thanks to redistricting, he must face another Democrat in an incumbent-vs-incumbent primary. <p>Bill Pugliano / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">For Democrats, the biggest primary today is in Michigan’s <strong>11th Congressional District</strong>, where <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a> threw Reps. Andy Levin and Haley Stevens together. (A majority of Levin’s current constituents actually live in the new 10th District, but that district now has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+6, so he decided to run in the D+15 11th District instead.) At first glance, Stevens has the geographic advantage, considering that she currently represents 45 percent of the new district to Levin’s 25 percent, but things are more even when you look at the people likely to vote in a Democratic primary: Among 11th District residents who voted for Biden in 2020, 38 percent are current Stevens constituents, while 29 percent are Levin constituents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Levin has the backing of the progressive wing of the party (e.g., <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/29/bernie-sanders-endorses-levin-tlaib-their-democratic-primaries/7771050001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a>) as well as <a href="https://www.andylevinforcongress.com/endorsements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several labor unions</a>, a powerful political force in Michigan. However, Stevens has the support of <a href="https://www.theoaklandpress.com/2022/02/12/rep-brenda-lawrence-endorses-stevens-not-levin-in-11th-district-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neighboring Rep. Brenda Lawrence</a>, who represents 30 percent of the new 11th. She’s also benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MI11&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$7.4 million in outside spending</a> from groups connected to her allies at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (which has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/12-democratic-primaries-to-watch-in-kentucky-north-carolina-pennsylvania-and-oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent profusely against progressives</a> all cycle long) and EMILY’s List. That has helped this race go from a <a href="https://jewishinsider.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/07005841/CD11DEMO-With-Watermark.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toss-up</a> in February to a <a href="https://jewishinsider.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/21101920/MI11-Polling-With-Watermark.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58-percent-to-31-percent</a> lead for Stevens in July, according to Target Insyght polling.</p>

But he’s been <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/10/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outraised</a> by attorney Huwaida Arraf ($524,000 raised) and Warren City Council Member Angela Rogensues ($328,000), both <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/05/10/macomb-based-u-s-house-seat-draws-diverse-democratic-field/9614386002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">younger women in their 40s</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

On the Republican side, meanwhile, businessman John James should easily dispatch his one opponent; after James’s impressive performances (albeit in losing efforts) in Michigan’s 2018 and 2020 U.S. Senate races, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/03/john-james-receives-donald-trumps-endorsement-for-us-house-seat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> and the <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2022/02/25/nrcc-announces-21-additional-on-the-radar-candidates-in-young-guns-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Republican Congressional Committee</a> are all-in on his candidacy. </p>

This Detroit-based seat or one of its predecessors has elected a <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Data/Black-American-Representatives-and-Senators-by-Congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black member of Congress</a> since 1954, but with Rep.

<p data-paragraph="main">State Rep. Shri Thanedar, who is Indian American, has poured <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MI13204/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$8.2 million</a> of his own money into his campaign, arguably putting him in pole position. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wdet.org/2022/07/26/political-leaders-fear-loss-of-black-representation-from-detroit-as-election-nears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black leaders fret</a> that the race’s multiple prominent Black candidates will split the vote. State Sen. Adam Hollier has raised the most money when you exclude self-funding (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MI13246/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$943,000</a>), and outside groups linked to AIPAC and cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried have also spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MI13&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $5 million</a> to support him or tear down Thanedar. However, Lawrence has gotten behind nonprofit CEO Portia Roberson, who has raised the second-most from donors at <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MI13295/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$410,000</a>. Other Black candidates with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hLZr5u9s1LRA0sza2pDOArTHuVgpGE-F/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high name recognition</a> (but <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/13/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not much cash</a>) include former Detroit General Counsel Sharon McPhail and John Conyers III, the son of longtime former Rep. John Conyers Jr. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A recent <a href="https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/30972/poll_shri_thanedar_leads_in_michigan_s_13th_congressional_district_followed_by_roberson_and_hollier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target Insyght poll</a> gave Thanedar the lead, but the race was within the margin of error. Thanedar took 22 percent of likely voters, Roberson 17 percent, Hollier 16 percent and Conyers and McPhail 7 percent each.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Detroit’s other congressional seat, the <strong>12th District</strong>, is also hosting a Democratic primary of note, but it doesn’t look nearly as competitive. Many Democrats still aren’t big fans of incumbent Rep. Rashida Tlaib, and for the second consecutive cycle, they’re trying to oust the <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/rashida-tlaibs-comment-about-trump-controversial-among-detroiters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outspoken</a> <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/03/tlaib-says-bidens-work-is-unfinished-in-progressive-response-to-state-of-the-union.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive</a> in a primary. But a <a href="https://jewishinsider.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24063657/FREQ-CD-12-PRIMARY-01212022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January poll</a> gave Tlaib 62 percent support, and since then Tlaib has outraised her closest competitor, Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/12/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.8 million to $327,000</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, three Republicans are squaring off for the right to take on vulnerable Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee in the R+1 <strong>8th District</strong>. Former Trump administration official Paul Junge has been named to the NRCC’s “<a href="https://nrcc.org/candidate-type/young-gun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Young Guns</a>” list and raked in a whopping <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0MI08141/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.4 million</a>, but businessman Matthew Seely has raised a respectable <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MI08196/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$535,000</a>, too. Junge would likely be a stronger general-election candidate against Kildee, who has a track record of outperforming his districts’ partisan leans, as Seely was a <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/12/michigans-matt-sealy-explains-president-trump-several-paths-victorynever-count-donald-trump-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vocal proponent</a> of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But Republican voters haven’t always opted for the most “electable” candidate this cycle.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> Attorney general, Value Them Both amendment</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, 9 p.m. Eastern in four western counties</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kansas’s two biggest races in the fall — for governor and the 3rd Congressional District — are likely to be snoozers in the primary: Republicans are very likely to nominate Attorney General Derek Schmidt to take on Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and former Kansas Republican Party Chair Amanda Adkins to take on Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Schmidt’s attempt at a promotion has left behind an unsettled GOP primary for <strong>attorney general</strong>. The biggest name in the field is former Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has earned a national reputation for his zealous crusades against <a href="https://www.al.com/live/2011/10/kris_kobach_the_kansas_lawyer_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-kansas-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voter fraud</a>. That celebrity helps explain his <a href="https://sunflowerstatejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/poll.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads</a> in every <a href="https://sunflowerstatejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KS-Statewide-GOP-Primary-Survey-KKC-090321.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public poll</a> of the race thus far (even those <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/07/07/polling-for-ag-candidate-tony-mattivi-reveals-hidden-appeal-among-gop-voters-for-a-crimefighter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted</a> by his <a href="https://sunflowerstatejournal.com/new-pac-backing-warren-releases-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opponents</a>). But Kobach also has serious baggage: His much-hyped pursuits of voter fraud have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/kris-kobach-and-search-mythical-voter-fraud/617069/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely come up empty</a>, his biggest accomplishments were so overreaching that they were <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/kris-kobachs-lucrative-trail-of-courtroom-defeats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down in court</a>, and he was held in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/18/603810241/federal-judge-holds-kris-kobach-in-contempt-of-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contempt of court</a> in 2018 and ordered to take <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article213415624.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remedial legal classes</a> for failing to follow basic legal procedures — not exactly an asset if you’re trying to become your state’s top lawyer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kobach’s most serious opponent looks to be state Sen. Kellie Warren, who has actually outraised Kobach <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/26/democrat-laura-kelly-republican-derek-schmidt-see-flood-cash-kansas-governor-race-2022-election/10145562002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$273,000 to $218,000</a> this year. Warren also boasts <a href="https://kelliewarrenforag.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a> from former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Americans for Prosperity-Kansas, which has spent six digits to help elect her. However, a third candidate, Tony Mattivi, has also raised ​​$165,000 this year and has contrasted his record as a <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/07/28/ex-federal-prosecutor-tony-mattivi-announces-kansas-attorney-general-run/5400891001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former federal prosecutor</a> with his two “career politician” opponents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Really, though, the biggest race in Kansas today is the <strong>Value Them Both amendment</strong>, a ballot measure that, if passed, would clarify that the Kansas Constitution does not protect abortion rights. As the first time abortion is on the ballot since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, this has been a fiercely fought campaign; <a href="https://coefficient.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KS-VTB-Amendment-7.18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the only poll of the amendment</a> so far showed a 4-point race.

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 3rd, 4th and 8th congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>11 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday’s nightcap is Washington, which <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/faqcandidates.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uses a top-two primary</a> in which all candidates run on the same ballot, regardless of party, and the two top vote-getters advance to the general election. This system <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/07/24/top-two-primary-in-washington-dethrones-trump-00047532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguably rewards moderation</a> more than traditional party primaries, and that could help save the careers of two Republicans who voted to impeach Trump: Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse. After all, pro-impeachment House Republicans are still just 1 for 2 this cycle, with Rep. David Valadao of California, the other top-two primary state, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-06-24/california-gop-rep-valadao-advances-in-us-house-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being the one success story</a> — although <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2022-primary/sov/86-congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he nearly failed to advance</a>. (South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/south-carolina-rep-tom-rice-loses-house-seat-after-voting-to-impeach-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost his primary</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Herrera Beutler may be more at risk in the <strong>3rd District</strong>, a R+11 seat in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">southwest Washington</a>. That’s because she has to fend off two strongly pro-Trump Republicans, former Army Green Beret Joe Kent and evangelical Christian author Heidi St. John, as well as <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/07/07/democrats-washington-3rd-district-congressional-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one notable Democrat</a>, auto shop owner Marie Gluesenkamp Perez. Both Kent and St. John got into the race <a href="https://tdn.com/news/three-challengers-jump-in-race-to-unseat-rep-jaime-herrera-beutler-in-washingtons-3rd-district/article_938852b6-6a69-5ae3-8d51-41b42c0c1db6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of Herrera Beutler’s impeachment vote</a>, and they could also attract Republican votes <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington-election-integrity-group-and-lawyer-fined-for-meritless-vote-fraud-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with their support</a> for Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election. Kent <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/trump-endorses-joe-kent-republican-challenger-to-rep-jaime-herrera-beutler-who-voted-for-impeachment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned Trump’s endorsement</a> and looks like the likeliest threat to Herrera Beutler, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/WA/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised</a> $2.3 million to her $3.5 million (St. John has raised $1 million, Perez $241,000).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But with four candidates competing for two spots, this race has some unusual dynamics. Because Perez is the only Democrat, we’d <em>usually</em> expect her to get the lion’s share of Democratic votes, around 40 percent overall. Such a showing would likely be enough to finish first and leave one spot open for the three Republicans battling over much of the remaining vote. Yet Herrera Beutler, whose impeachment vote could attract some Democrats who know the seat will likely go red in November, has appealed to them with ads that make her sound like, well, a Democrat — <a href="https://youtu.be/NQwr1G5PR0o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighting her support</a> for caps on insulin prices and <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/d2459482-fa67-45ab-9794-da9e45b99627/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacking Kent</a> for wanting to privatize social security.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/blitz-of-pac-money-aims-to-defeat-trump-backed-challengers-to-herrera-beutler-newhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside groups have mostly spent</a> to help Herrera Beutler and hinder Kent. The one poll we have explains why: Back in May, the <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/wa-03-primary-523/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group found</a> Kent ahead of Herrera Beutler, 28 percent to 22 percent, with a Democrat <a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2022/may/20/democrat-hennrich-withdraws-from-3rd-congressional-district-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who later dropped out to back Perez</a> running third with 12 percent and St. John in fourth with 9 percent. With that in mind, Winning for Women Action Fund <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00698936/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has spent</a> $1.7 million going after Kent and $618,000 boosting the incumbent. The second-biggest outside spender <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/07/15/heidi-st-john-washington-state-far-right-republican-congress-third-district-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is more mysterious</a> but may be looking to help Herrera Beutler by splitting the GOP base: Conservatives for a Stronger America <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00820001/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has spent</a> $932,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/HeatherKaiserWA/status/1552828229504753665?s=20&amp;t=wWh2yOtOsSdLXHJSs_2qFQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting St. John</a> and $521,000 opposing Kent, prompting Kemp <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/07/15/heidi-st-john-washington-state-far-right-republican-congress-third-district-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to claim the group wanted to help</a> St. John, the “spoiler candidate.” Despite all this financial help, however, Herrera Beutler could still come up short against Kent, who <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/politics/elections/district-3-challenger-joe-kent-extremist-ties/281-0ffebca7-f94b-4527-80e9-ea16a79849ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has ties to white nationalists</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In central Washington’s <strong>4th District</strong>, Newhouse may have better odds than Herrera Beutler because the R+25 district is red enough to <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/jul/18/district-4-congressional-race-newhouse-faces-seven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially send two Republicans</a> to the general election, having done so in <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/nov/08/newhouse-wins-seat-in-4th-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014</a> and <a href="https://www.sunnysidesun.com/news/dan-newhouse-clear-winner-in-house-race/article_1635a510-7d94-5630-9008-e1b3831f14cc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> under the district’s old but similarly drawn lines. Newhouse does have to contend with Loren Culp, the GOP’s <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=53&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed 2020 gubernatorial candidate</a> who <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/trump-endorses-loren-culp-in-challenge-to-wa-rep-dan-newhouse-who-voted-for-impeachment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has Trump’s endorsement</a>, but Culp and other notable Republicans — former NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler, marketing professional Corey Gibson and state Rep. Brad Klippert — <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/WA/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have all struggled to fundraise</a>. Newhouse has garnered $1.6 million, compared with Sessler’s mostly self-funded $508,000 and Culp’s $311,000. Given their weaker campaigns, Newhouse could also advance along with the lone Democrat in the race, businessman Doug White, who could benefit from a unified Democratic front while the heavily Republican vote is divided among multiple GOP contenders.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The incumbent has also benefited from a little over $1.5 million in outside spending, mostly by Defending Main Street, a moderate GOP super PAC that <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00540203/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has spent</a> $504,000 supporting Newhouse <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/9ed30d5b-a2c4-4c6b-a5d5-fdd08c636297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for protecting American farms</a> and $660,000 <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/be676545-cba4-4868-b853-d4c1ca4b9b0b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacking Culp</a> as a “tax dodger.” Unfortunately, we don’t have any recent polling of this race, so it’s hard to say — like Herrera Beutler, Newhouse may not be out of the woods.</p>

Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier is defending this seat, and the top-two primary will decide her November opponent as well as provide clues about what to expect in the fall. She’ll meet either former Army Ranger Jesse Jensen (whom Schrier <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20201103/federal-all.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beat in 2020</a> by about 4 points); businessman Matt Larkin, who lost as the GOP’s candidate in the <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20201103/attorney-general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 attorney general’s race</a>; or King County Councilmember Reagan Dunn, whose mother represented this area from 1993 to 2005.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All three candidates have posted <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/WA/08/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar fundraising numbers</a>, with Jensen bringing in $1.1 million, Larkin $970,000 (more than half from his own pocket) and Dunn $833,000. But Jensen has also benefited from $336,000 <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00782144/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in outside support</a> from Lead the Way, a super PAC backing his candidacy. The group has attacked Dunn, running ads claiming he voted to cut law enforcement funding and sent out mailers portraying Dunn as <a href="https://washingtonobserver.substack.com/p/pac-money-comes-after-dunn-in-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an abusive alcoholic</a> (Dunn <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/as-he-runs-for-congress-reagan-dunn-recounts-battle-with-alcoholism-and-his-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has discussed</a> his drinking struggles, including a 2014 DUI charge). Given the national environment, however, whichever Republican advances with Schrier should have a decent shot at flipping the swing seat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, we are watching the race for <strong>Senate</strong>, in which Democratic Sen. Patty Murray is seeking her sixth term. But despite Washington’s D+12 <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan lean</a>, this election could get interesting. After all, during the 2010 “red wave,” Murray <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2010&amp;fips=53&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won by roughly 5 points</a>, her closest margin since she first won in 1992. Republicans have coalesced around Tiffany Smiley, a former nurse <a href="https://www.khq.com/news/after-her-husband-lost-his-eyesight-in-iraq-tiffany-smiley-is-on-a-quest-for/article_479fc0f9-1e69-561e-a4f2-aacb6e7d2202.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who became a veterans advocate</a> after her husband was blinded while serving in the Iraq War. She’s shown signs of competitiveness, too, having <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/WA/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $7.1 million</a>. But Murray has still brought in twice as much money and has run ads using <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/aa751805-2913-4ad3-8622-fb44bead19a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audio of Smiley</a> saying she’s “100 percent pro-life,” which could be damaging in a state as blue as Washington. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two independent surveys <a href="https://crosscut.com/politics/2022/07/poll-red-wave-not-likely-wash-wa-shores" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted in early July</a> found <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=ba87c5ad-0717-4940-9580-a782faf9c16f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murray ahead by</a> just under 20 points, so Smiley clearly has her work cut out for her. But watch how the two-party vote breaks down tonight: Back in 2010, Republican candidates <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20100817/us-senator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actually won a slightly larger share</a> than the Democrats did, a harbinger for Murray’s narrow margin in the general election.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 5th Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>Thursday at 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, Tennessee isn’t one of the six states going to the polls on Tuesday, but it will host one interesting GOP contest on its primary day, Thursday, Aug. 4. Republicans in the Tennessee General Assembly redrew the state’s <strong>5th Congressional District</strong> from a safely blue seat to a safely red one in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>, and a dozen Republicans initially filed to take advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former State Department official Morgan Ortagus, whom Trump <a href="https://www.mainstreet-nashville.com/news/trump-endorses-ortagus-to-represent-nashville-in-congress/article_d9976c4c-7ed2-11ec-940f-3bf4432ffc7e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> over the objection of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/trump-s-pick-house-seat-morgan-ortagus-met-open-revolt-n1291407" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several local Republicans</a>, stood out from the field early on. But, just like in the race for Michigan governor, disqualifications soon changed the trajectory of the race. In April, the state GOP kicked Ortagus and two other candidates <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/20/morgan-ortagus-baxter-lee-robby-starbuck-removed-tennessee-republican-primary/7381732001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off the ballot</a> for not voting in three out of the last four GOP primaries in Tennessee (a requirement that Ortagus, who moved to Tennessee just last year, could not meet).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s left us with an uncertain primary, even with just a few days remaining. None of the nine candidates remaining on the ballot have the benefit of Trump’s endorsement, but three do have something else significant going in their favor. Retired Brigadier General Kurt Winstead has self-funded <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2TN05370/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.1 million</a> and raised almost $1 million more from other donors. Former state House Speaker Beth Harwell has a long history in local politics and the endorsement of multiple GOP women’s groups, such as <a href="https://viewpac.org/who-we-support/#TENNESSEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VIEW PAC</a>. And Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles has benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=TN05&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $2 million</a> in outside spending from tea-party-aligned super PACs. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Last week Sens. Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer announced they had reached an agreement on a climate, tax and health care bill — an outcome that seemed unlikely just weeks ago. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses how Congress has been passing a slew of legislation recently and whether that trend will continue with the new Inflation Reduction Act. Speaking of inflation, the team also breaks down how the latest economic debate — if the U.S. is entering a recession — could affect the midterm elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, they cover some juicy political news from last week, including the relaunch of Andrew Yang’s Forward Party, which has joined forces with two centrist groups, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/07/26/trump-justice-investigation-january-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post’s report</a> that the Department of Justice is looking into former President Donald Trump’s actions regarding its Jan. 6 criminal investigation.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">After taking a month off (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-to-watch-in-the-maryland-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly</a>), primary season is back in full force this Tuesday, Aug. 2. Voters in six states will choose candidates for the November elections, and there are so many compelling primaries that we’re previewing them in two installments again. Today, we’ll take you through the 12 races we’re watching in Missouri and Arizona, highlighted by two open and very uncertain GOP primaries for Senate and two election deniers who could win high office in a key 2024 swing state.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1238739750-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1238739750-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1238739750-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1238739750-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Once the front-runner in Missouri’s GOP primary for U.S. Senate, the state’s disgraced former governor, Eric Greitens, is now trailing in the polls. <p>Tristan Wheelock / Bloomberg / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Missouri</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 1st, 4th and 7th congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the retirement of Sen. Roy Blunt, Missouri has an open <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> seat for the first time since 2010. At first, the front-runner in the Republican primary was former Gov. Eric Greitens, who is attempting a political comeback after resigning under pressure in 2018. But the prospect of Greitens as the nominee gave <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/03/21/greitens-allegations-draw-republican-criticism-calls-drop-out/9454507002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republicans heartburn</a>: Greitens had resigned amid <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/woman-testifies-that-greitens-groped-and-hit-her-governor-blasts-lies-and-tabloid-trash/article_23265ac0-6cfe-597e-9b62-92df8d0b1e62.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disturbing allegations</a> that he had abused and blackmailed a woman he was having an affair with, coercing her to perform oral sex, hitting her and taking nude photos of her without her consent and then threatening to release them if she spoke out, among other things.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Voters were reminded of Greitens’s past this year, too, when his ex-wife <a href="https://www.kcur.org/news/2022-03-21/eric-greitens-accused-by-ex-wife-of-physically-abusing-his-family-unstable-and-coercive-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused him</a> of hitting her and their children during their marriage. The problem for anti-Greitens Republicans, though, has been settling on a single alternative. GOP megadonors Rex Sinquefield and Peter Thiel have backed Attorney General Eric Schmitt, while Missouri’s other senator, Josh Hawley, <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/12/hawley-endorses-vicky-hartzler-missouri-u-s-senate-race/6765929001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got behind</a> Rep. Vicky Hartzler. And the field has three other serious candidates, too: Rep. Billy Long, state Sen. Dave Schatz and Mark McCloskey, the attorney who gained national attention in 2020, along with his wife, for <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/the-st-louis-couple-charged-with-waving-guns-at-protesters-have-a-long-history-of/article_281d9989-373e-53c3-abcb-ecd0225dd287.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointing a gun</a> at racial-justice protesters walking past his St. Louis home.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Once the latest abuse allegations against Greitens became public in March, <a href="https://www.koamnewsnow.com/missouri-election-poll-candidates-voting-trust-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greitens</a>, <a href="https://themissouritimes.com/new-remington-poll-show-schmitt-leading-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schmitt</a> and <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/TRF-MO-GOP-Sen-Poll-Report-0329.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hartzler</a> traded leads in the polls. But since June, a <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article263836367.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trio of polls</a> conducted in late July all put Schmitt in first place, Hartzler in second and Greitens in third, albeit by differing margins. What changed? Shortly after Greitens released a <a href="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/government-politics-issues/2022-06-20/eric-greitens-rino-hunting-ad-gets-national-attention-and-condemnation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily criticized campaign ad</a> showing him “hunting” moderate Republicans with a gun, a new <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/23/republicans-launch-super-pac-to-stop-greitens-in-missouri-00041791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinquefield-backed super PAC</a>, Show Me Values, spun up and spent a whopping <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00816991/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$7.9 million</a> attacking Greitens. Meanwhile, spending by the pro-Schmitt Americans for Prosperity has reached nearly <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MOS1&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.7 million</a>, while another Sinquefield super PAC, Save Missouri Values, has spent almost $5.2 million supporting Schmitt and attacking Hartzler. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former President Donald Trump hasn’t endorsed anyone in this primary, though he has <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/07/09/trump-says-he-wont-endorse-vicky-hartzler-calls-eric-greitens-smart-and-tough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoken favorably of Greitens</a>, who has embraced Trump-style grievances in his own campaign, and <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/03/24/trump-gives-boost-but-not-endorsement-to-billy-long-in-u-s-senate-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long</a>, who voted not to certify the 2020 election. And, of course, whoever the winner of the GOP primary is will be <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/missouri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly favored</a> to win this seat in November (yes, even if it’s Greitens). But 11 Democrats are hoping to buck the odds. The two main candidates are Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/MO/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.7 million</a>, and Trudy Busch Valentine, a registered nurse and heir to the Anheuser-Busch beer fortune, who has self-funded <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2MO00692/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $3 million</a>. The race has gotten nasty in the past couple weeks, though, with Kunce <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1550524536747073538?s=20&amp;t=H4uzYBG_t95ILwbTSleSjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">airing attack ads</a> publicizing how, as a young woman in 1977, Busch Valentine was crowned “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/03/30/missouri-senate-trudy-anheuser-busch-ball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Queen of Love and Beauty</a>” by a St. Louis secret society that did not admit Black or Jewish people at the time.</p>

In Hartzler’s <strong>4th District</strong>, seven Republicans are hoping to punch their ticket to Congress, and there’s no clear front-runner. According to an <a href="https://moscout.com/s/MOSCOUT-012122.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early poll</a>, former local-news anchor Mark Alford started off with a modest lead (perhaps due to name recognition). But he’s been convincingly outraised by former Boone County Clerk Taylor Burks, by about <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MO04140/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$851,000</a> to nearly <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MO04207/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600,000</a>, and CPA and cattle farmer Kalena Bruce was able to snag the <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/06/07/missouri-gov-mike-parson-backing-kalena-bruce-in-crowded-4th-district-gop-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement of Gov. Mike Parson</a>. Meanwhile, School Freedom Fund, a super PAC connected to the tea party group Club for Growth, has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MO04&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a> to help boost state Sen. Rick Brattin, a member of the “<a href="https://www.kcur.org/podcast/up-to-date/2022-02-10/missouri-senates-conservative-caucus-is-making-its-presence-known" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative caucus</a>,” a thorn in the side of Republican leadership in Jefferson City. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The tea party movement is also hoping to notch a win next door, in Long’s <strong>7th District</strong>. Eight candidates are seeking the GOP nomination, but the Club for Growth has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MO07&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a> to ensure it goes to state Sen. Eric Burlison, another conservative caucus member who is also endorsed by <a href="https://freedomworksforamerica.org/press-releases/freedomworks-for-america-endorses-eric-burlison-in-missouris-seventh-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreedomWorks</a> and the political arm of the <a href="https://www.housefreedomfund.com/#candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Caucus</a>. His main foe appears to be former state Sen. Jay Wasson, who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MO07168/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a> for his own campaign and has also benefited from a super PAC spending more than <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00820308/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$945,000</a> attacking his opponents. Burlison’s and Wasson’s campaigns have released <a href="https://twitter.com/galenbacharier/status/1528733967771484167?s=20&amp;t=oiHsWeodTDP_ErQ-Paocgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dueling</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/galenbacharier/status/1530297481912889344?s=20&amp;t=QWBsmfkdO7JjUNbF-x7cXQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls</a>, each showing their own candidate ahead; in both polls, though, second place belongs to state Sen. Mike Moon, who could shoot the gap if Wasson and Burlison go nuclear on each other.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, Republicans — and even some Democrats — would love to see progressive Rep. Cori Bush lose the Democratic primary in Missouri’s <strong>1st District</strong>, but like other primary challenges of both far-left and far-right representatives recently, this one is likely to fall flat. With the support of former Rep. Lacy Clay, whom Bush <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upset in 2020</a>, a former Republican operative has <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/politics/national-politics/cori-bushs-path-to-re-election-faces-republicans-and-revenge-lacy-clay-aide-gop-operatives-organize-dark-money-groups-to-oppose-her/63-c66a2b10-cbca-4936-bc8d-9d4f4cbaa738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a super PAC</a> to support state Sen. Steve Roberts, who is <a href="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/government-politics-issues/2022-07-28/bush-defends-her-record-in-congress-while-roberts-calls-for-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running as a “normal Democrat”</a> who won’t give the Biden administration a hard time. However, Roberts has been dogged by <a href="https://www.kmov.com/2022/04/19/news-4-exclusive-congressional-candidate-accused-raping-well-known-public-servant-speaks-out-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous allegations</a> that he raped former state Rep. Cora Faith Walker and groped a law student at a bar. Bush has also raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MO/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than four times as much money</a> as Roberts, and a <a href="https://moscout.com/daily-updates-1/2022/7/9/moscout-weekender-trump-disses-hartzler-bush-leads-cd-1-lobbyists-pessimistic-on-special-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from early July</a> showed her beating him 40 percent to 20 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th congressional districts; governor; attorney general; secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>10 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At <a href="http://co.la-paz.az.us/DocumentCenter/View/7735/La-Paz-County-Republican-Primary-Ballot-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the top of Arizona’s packed ballot</a> is the race for <strong>Senate</strong>, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is seeking a full term after winning a special election in 2020. Kelly is <a href="https://apps.arizona.vote/electioninfo/elections/2022-primary-election/federal/2518/32/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unopposed in the Democratic primary</a>, but the GOP contest has developed into a contentious race between former Thiel Foundation President Blake Masters and solar power businessman Jim Lamon, with Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich trailing just behind them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Masters is arguably the front-runner in this race, boosted by an <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/blog/trump-endorses-masters-in-arizona-gop-primary-for-u-s-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement from former President Donald Trump</a> and close ties to billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/22/peter-thiel-arizona-senate-campaign-00047536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has dropped about</a> $15 million into the pro-Masters super PAC Saving Arizona. Three recent surveys both put Masters ahead of Lamon, but the margin varied between 8 and 15 points. <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TRF-AZ-GOP-Gov-0727-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Trafalgar Group</a> found Masters up 35 percent to 27 percent, Rasmussen Reports/Arizona Rock Products Association <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/partner_surveys/july_2022/trump_backed_candidates_lead_arizona_gop_primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed Masters ahead</a> 31 percent to 19 percent, and OH Predictive Insights <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/state-of-gop-voters-break-heavy-and-hard-for-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found Masters up</a> 36 percent to 21 percent. A <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/582639708/The-Gateway-Pundit-Arizona-Poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of polls</a> from <a href="https://azhighground.com/masters-leads-crowded-field-in-arizonas-republican-primary-for-united-states-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier in the month</a> put <a href="https://www.alloyanalytics.org/post/senate2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masters in the lead</a>, too. However, Battleground Connect has released three polls last month, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jNjLqwaY9SmmZenBlbUobkUlokTbivbL/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recently last week</a>, that <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SeEqKkqCM5Aibk8H9R62l8hja0aJyqRY/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all gave</a> Lamon <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z1qxiDzSS_0xzkYt6_PqQQIXkTSdo2hc/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a small edge</a>, but inside the margin of error.

<p data-paragraph="main">However, Masters has expressed some views that have already come back to bite him. On the campaign trail, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jun/16/jim-lamon/arizona-us-senate-race-attack-ties-masters-nazis-u/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he praised positions held by Ted Kaczynski</a>, the Unabomber, though did not endorse his terrorism. As a college student, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/us/politics/blake-masters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued online</a> that “unrestricted” immigration was the appropriate position to take as a Libertarian, as he then identified. Lamon has tried to attack him <a href="https://youtu.be/mJr4JzfKbIc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as favoring “open borders”</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/aDyKU60UU0M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as “not right” for Arizona</a>, but Masters and his allies have fallen back on his Trump endorsement, airing <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/d18f6e97-4569-4664-8c35-b30066fdbbe9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ad</a> of the former president praising him and ads from <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/880515d1-b36d-4972-b58e-4f2ebf624a68" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Club for Growth Action</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/gJ3HVBAiqDg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving Arizona</a> calling Masters an “<a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/4ae62097-7fff-46be-bc9e-2155f2525c56" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America First</a>” political outsider. They’ve also <a href="https://youtu.be/pIcFDfx36-A%20https://youtu.be/yKVTY15dQ1g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked Lamon</a> in the final days of the campaign, arguing he <a href="https://youtu.be/yKVTY15dQ1g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposed</a> Trump’s policies toward China <a href="https://time.com/5084108/solar-energy-tariff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of his business dealings there</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This race has cost gobs of money, too, with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AZ00331/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lamon loaning his campaign $14 million</a> and Masters’s allies <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=AZS1&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending</a> $8.3 million supporting him and $5.3 million attacking Lamon. Brnovich has also raised $3.1 million and could still be in the hunt. The eventual GOP nominee will face a tough race against Kelly, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0AZ00350/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised over</a> $50 million this cycle — although the midterm environment should provide the Republican with a tailwind.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Up until recently, Lake looked like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-gop-could-make-or-break-its-chances-in-10-key-governors-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a clear front-runner</a>, but the primary has tightened after former Rep. Matt Salmon <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2022/06/28/matt-salmon-drops-out-race-arizona-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> and threw his support behind Robson (although his name will still be on the ballot). Plus, Robson has an <a href="https://ktar.com/story/5172711/karrin-taylor-robson-spends-nearly-2m-in-july-loans-campaign-another-1-85m/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelming spending advantage</a>: She spent $18.4 million through July 16, around five times as much as Lake’s $3.6 million — an edge enabled by Robson’s $15.2 million in self-funding.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Robson has used that money to <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/blog/karrin-taylor-robsons-tv-ad-blitz-intensifies-as-early-voting-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blanket Arizona with ads</a> playing up <a href="https://youtu.be/z8GH6YVzVTg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her endorsements</a> and arguing she has the best plan <a href="https://youtu.be/mIxL74vHPNY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to deal with border security</a>. Lake has staked much of her campaign on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=784054509629037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a> and her own plans for the border, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=410737540989553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promising</a> to issue a “declaration of invasion” as governor and <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/c3f83524-acd0-4ee8-a561-a63b6878a858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacking Robson</a> as a “RINO” — a  Republican in name only.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into primary day, the final polls still suggest that Lake is favored but, depending on the poll, Robson may be within striking distance. Last week, both <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/az-gov-gop-0728/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group</a> and Rasmussen polls found Lake up 9 points, while OH Predictive Insights gave Lake an 18-point edge.

Finally, a <a href="https://twitter.com/claynrobinson/status/1551676718573703168?s=20&amp;t=G-ciSVJ0S36r6YOll-Sfmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late July survey</a> by Public Opinion Strategies on behalf of Robson’s campaign found the candidates tied at 43 percent apiece.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The winner of the Republican primary will likely face Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, the Democratic front-runner. She <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2022/07/05/marco-lopez-democrat-arizona-governor-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces one primary opponent</a>, Marco Lopez, the former mayor of Nogales who worked under former Democratic Gov.

Fundraising reports suggest there are two main GOP contenders: state Rep. Mark Finchem and advertising executive Beau Lane, who have both raised <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2019%7CendYear=2023%7COfficeID=2010%7CPartyID=30%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> for the cycle. And the two couldn’t be more different. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finchem is an <a href="https://votefinchem.com/az-sec-of-state-candidate-mark-finchem-ladies-gentlemen-we-know-it-they-know-it-donald-trump-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outspoken supporter</a> of the lie that Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 election. He signed onto a <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2020/12/14/fake-electoral-votes-trump-arizona-gop-has-completely-lost/3898476001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolution</a> urging Congress to accept Trump’s fake electors in Arizona, and he <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/06/02/mark-finchem-was-much-closer-to-the-jan-6-insurrection-than-he-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a> at the U.S. Capitol, actions that helped him land <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/09/13/trump-endorses-mark-finchem-arizona-secretary-state-election/8322839002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a> in this race. He has also previously <a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/arizona-lawmakers-oath-keepers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated himself with the Oath Keepers</a>, an anti-government militia, and <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-legislators-to-speak-at-qanon-conference-in-las-vegas-11884331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported the QAnon conspiracy theory</a>. By contrast, Lane is the only candidate in the Republican primary who has unreservedly <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/13/beau-lane-arizona-secretary-of-state-primary-2022-candidate/7491756001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledged the legitimacy of Biden’s win</a>, and he’s defended Arizona’s widespread use of early and absentee voting.

<p data-paragraph="main">Two other Republicans who have encouraged election-fraud claims are also in the running, even if they haven’t raised quite as much cash: <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/06/22/shawnna-bolick-author-of-bill-to-reject-voters-presidential-choice-running-to-be-top-elections-official/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state Rep.

Michelle Ugenti-Rita</a> ($122,000). Their presence, though, may not be enough to split the illiberal vote: The Rasmussen poll gave Finchem a 27-percent-to-16-percent lead over Lane, with Ugenti-Rita at 12 percent and Bolick at 11 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whoever wins the GOP nomination, though, will be in for a tough race in November against the Democratic nominee, which could be either former Maricopa County Clerk Adrian Fontes or state House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding. Fontes led Bolding 44 percent to 29 percent in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Garrett_Archer/status/1551989419506221056?s=20&amp;t=puWboBbsRcXeayalWUspTQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July poll</a>, but neither candidate is acting like the primary is in the bag. They generally <a href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/053022_az_sos_debate/bolding-fontes-spar-over-az-secretary-state-qualifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agree on election-related issues</a>, but this campaign has been marked by <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/07/20/democrats-running-arizona-secretary-state-face-issues-taxes/10109699002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative personal attacks</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The last statewide race of interest is for <strong>attorney general</strong>, which is open due to Brnovich’s campaign for Senate. Here, too, there is a crowded Republican primary featuring four candidates who have embraced Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election. One of them, former Maricopa County prosecutor Abraham Hamadeh, <a href="https://ktar.com/story/5107872/former-president-trump-endorses-abraham-hamadeh-for-arizona-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned Trump’s endorsement</a> in mid-June. However, the 31-year-old, first-time candidate has caught flak from Trump favorites like <a href="https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2022/07/20/gosar-raising-questions-regarding-arizona-attorney-general-candidate-abe-hamadeh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Rep. Paul Gosar</a> because he appears to have <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2022/07/27/abe-hamadeh-trump-endorsement-attorney-general-after-loan/10158901002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflated his campaign fundraising numbers</a> to woo Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, Gosar <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-candidate-for-arizona-attorney-general-touts-endorsement-from-far-right-gosar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has backed</a> Rodney Glassman, an attorney and former <em>Democratic</em> nominee for Senate (he lost badly to the late Sen. John McCain in 2010) who is also another election denier; joining him and Hamadeh are corporate lawyer Dawn Grove and 2020 congressional candidate Tiffany Shedd. The only competitive candidate who hasn’t fully bought into the idea the 2020 election was stolen is former Arizona Supreme Court Justice Andrew Gould, although he has said Brnovich, as attorney general, <a href="https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/election-border-security-highlight-debate-for-arizona-ag/article_56b6d79c-d213-11ec-a5e2-439dc3f8847b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have potentially slowed down</a> the election certification process. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The only poll we’ve seen is the Rasmussen survey, which found Hamedeh holding a slim 5-point lead over Glassman, 26 percent to 21 percent, with Gould at 12 percent and Grove and Shedd in the single digits. Glassman will hope, however, that his fundraising edge makes a difference in the end, as he leads the way with $2.5 million raised, while Grove and Gould have each brought in about $1.4 million. (Grove self-funded roughly 90 percent of her campaign with help from relatives, while Gould raised money mostly from donors.) Hamadeh has now raised a tad over $1 million, around two-thirds from himself or family, while Shedd has brought in $475,000. The winner of this race will face Kris Mayes, an attorney and former member of the state’s public utilities commission who is running unopposed for the Democratic nomination.</p>

Moderate Democratic Rep. Tom O’Halleran <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/07/11/ohalleran-keeps-running-against-the-odds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to seek reelection</a> even though <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting shifted his seat</a> from R+6 to R+15, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> The leading Republican contenders appear to be Navy SEAL veteran Eli Crane, state Rep. Walt Blackman and businessman Mark DeLuzio — although Ron Watkins, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/19/technology/qanon-messages-authors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who may be behind Q</a>, the message board account that fueled the QAnon conspiracy theory, is also in the running.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The polls here are far from definitive, though, as <a href="https://blackmanforcongress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blackman_Polling-Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blackman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/EliCrane_CEO/status/1547719812305997824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crane</a> have each released surveys showing themselves leading. But Crane is probably the favorite: The founder of a <a href="https://bottlebreacher.com/blog/beyond-battle-eli-crane-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bottle-opener business</a>, he’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/AZ/02/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led the money race</a> with about $2 million raised, and <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-4bv79bdxaz2294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he earned Trump’s endorsement</a> last month. He is one of several candidates to publicly support <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-jan-6-election-lie/2022/01/05/82f4cad4-6cb6-11ec-974b-d1c6de8b26b0_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s false election claims</a>. Blackman is <a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/losing-arizona-rep-walter-blackman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another election denier</a> who is trying to become the first Black member of Congress from Arizona. He’s raised about $1.1 million and sports endorsements from many fellow members of the state legislature. DeLuzio has self-funded most of his campaign with $1 million out of his own pocket. He’s also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik4T9niX6Qs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run ads</a> promoting his endorsement from former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick’s retirement has made the <strong>6th District</strong> the state’s only open House seat, which redistricting swung from D+2 to R+7. And this southeast Arizona seat is now a top-tier target for national Republicans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/04/us/politics/gop-diversity-texas-arizona.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who have rallied</a> behind Juan Ciscomani, a former advisor to Ducey. However, they aren’t taking a Ciscomani win for granted: The Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC connected to House Republican leadership, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=AZ06" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has spent</a> $1.1 million supporting him <a href="https://youtu.be/yLtgJKMjNLY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with ads</a> touting his conservative bona fides. This investment might be because of Kathleen Winn, a member of the Maricopa County Community College District Governing Board, who <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/05/17/border-stolen-election-claims-top-gop-arizona-6th-district-congressional-debate/9801900002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejects the validity</a> of the 2020 election and has <a href="https://news.azpm.org/s/94719-why-the-race-in-this-arizona-congressional-district-is-attracting-national-attention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned the backing</a> of Gosar, Lake and Arpaio. However, Ciscomani, who has raised doubts about the 2020 election, still has far more resources, having raised $1.7 million to Winn’s $293,000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, former state Sen. Kirsten Engel and state Rep. Daniel Hernandez Jr. are facing off in the Democratic primary, which has focused on abortion. Hernandez <a href="https://youtu.be/k9EdFoZzjNA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has portrayed himself</a> as a defender of abortion rights, but Engel, a law professor at the University of Arizona, <a href="https://news.azpm.org/s/94719-why-the-race-in-this-arizona-congressional-district-is-attracting-national-attention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has criticized</a> Hernandez for <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview?SessionID=125" target="_blank" rel="noopener">missing a vote</a> on a bill in the legislature that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-arizona-mississippi-d88d5a28973039a3fedadaaf3d086b1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned abortion access after 15 weeks</a>. While Hernandez released a poll in early June showing him up 36 percent to 20 percent, Engel <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/AZ/06/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has actually outraised him</a>, $1.3 million to $1.1 million, and entered the final months of the race with nearly twice as much money in the bank. Still, Hernandez is well-known in Arizona because <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-arizona-voting-presidential-fa7f5475417c5b24b0ac6735ce7832a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he helped save the life</a> of then-Rep. Gabby Giffords after a gunman shot her in a failed assassination attempt in 2011. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Phoenix-based <strong>4th</strong> <strong>District </strong>is another district that’s gotten less friendly for Democrats, shifting from D+15 to D+1 in redistricting, which has put Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton on the defensive. He’ll likely face either former congressional staffer Tanya Contreras Wheeless or restaurant owner Kelly Cooper, the two leading contenders in the GOP primary. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We haven’t seen any primary polling, but Wheeless may be favored given the support she’s received from national GOP groups. She has received around $800,000 in backing from the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00698936/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Winning For Women Action Fund</a> (about half supporting Wheeless and half attacking Cooper), $344,000 from the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00812685/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strong Leaders Fund</a> and $175,000 <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/congressional-leadership-fund/C00504530/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the CLF</a>, and she’s raised $1.2 million on her own. But Cooper’s fundraising totals match Wheeless’s: He’s given himself $1.3 million and raised $1.5 million overall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, scandal-plagued Rep. David Schweikert is trying to fend off insurance company founder Elijah Norton in the <strong>1st District</strong>, which became somewhat less red in redistricting, going from R+13 to R+7. Norton <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/26/schweikert-and-norton-question-each-others-ethics-ugly-gop-primary/7562865001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has gone after</a> Schweikert for a <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/11/david-schweikert-campaign-agrees-fine-violations/6757307001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fine the Federal Election Commission</a> issued for campaign finance violations and <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/07/30/rep-david-schweikert-admits-11-ethics-violations-pay-50-000-fine/5362363002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violations of House ethics rules</a>. And <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AZ06247/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to around</a> $4.5 million in self-funding, Norton <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/AZ/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a huge money edge</a> over Schweikert, who has raised only $1.3 million. But Schweikert and his allies <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/super-pac-sued-after-website-calls-elijah-norton-a-scam-artist-13747806" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have criticized</a> Norton for running an insurance company that allegedly defrauded customers. They’ve also sent mailers to voters implying that Norton is gay, which <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/07/12/rep-david-schweikert-allies-sued-over-ads-implying-opponent-gay/10039975002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompted a lawsuit</a> by a man pictured with Norton in the mailer. We don’t have any polling in this race so it’s hard to know how much trouble Schweikert is in, but the winner will likely face businessman Jevin Hodge, who is favored in the Democratic primary.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">If anyone could be called a political survivor, it’s Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. She’s held office for three-plus terms while never winning a majority of the vote in a general election. She even <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lisa-murkowski-wins-alaska-senate-race-joe-miller/story?id=12164212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overcame a primary defeat</a> with a write-in campaign in 2010. And despite anger from some in the state’s GOP, she <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/0617/Why-this-Republican-senator-has-been-able-to-forge-her-own-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has operated</a> as one of the <a href="https://voteview.com/person/40300/lisa-murkowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more independent-minded members</a> of the U.S. Senate since she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/21/us/new-alaska-governor-gives-daughter-his-seat-in-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed in December 2002</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now seeking her fourth full term in 2022, Murkowski faces a fresh challenge: Defeating a fellow Republican in Alaska’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new electoral system</a> that combines the nation’s first top-four primary with ranked choice voting in the general election. Helpfully, recent polling has given us some insight into how Murkowski might defeat her GOP challenger, former commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Administration Kelly Tshibaka, <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/06/18/trump-gives-complete-and-total-endorsement-to-tshibaka-in-alaska-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whom former President Donald Trump has endorsed</a>. With support from Democrats, independents and possibly just enough Republicans, Murkowski could still be in the Senate come 2023.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, Murkowski’s approval rating has improved more than almost any other senator since President Biden took office. New <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/07/25/murkowski-experiences-mid-campaign-approval-bump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey data from Morning Consult</a> found that 46 percent of Alaska registered voters approved of Murkowski in the second quarter of 2022, while 39 percent disapproved. This marked the first time Morning Consult had found Murkowski in net-positive territory during Biden’s presidency. The data also showed how Murkowski is an atypical politician: She had better ratings among those who identify with the opposing party than among her own. The survey found that 62 percent of Democrats approved of her, while 23 percent disapproved. By comparison, 41 percent of Republicans approved of her versus 46 percent who disapproved (she ran about even among independents). However, Murkowski still needs some GOP support in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red-leaning Alaska</a> to win, and she might be able to retain it: Those numbers among Republicans were much better than in the first quarter of 2021, when 76 percent of them disapproved of her.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, it’s not hard to see why Democrats now have a better opinion of Murkowski than Republicans do. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/02/collins-murkowski-introduce-alternative-senate-bill-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murkowski supports abortion rights</a>, and she’s tallied a number of conservative apostasies in recent years, including <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-skinny-repeal-option-health-care/story?id=48870581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her 2017 vote against repealing</a> the Affordable Care Act and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/republicans-vote-convict-trump-impeachment-trial-75878936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her vote to convict Trump</a> in the impeachment trial following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The latter vote even led the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-alaska-anchorage-lisa-murkowski-elections-abbf5443c98c3b8df52973e79deb4b44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska GOP to censure her</a>. Going back to 2010, her tea party-backed primary challenger, Joe Miller, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/29/AR2010072905867.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cast her as a RINO</a> — “Republican in name only” — and narrowly defeated her for renomination. But Murkowski <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/11/the-unlikely-reincarnation-of-lisa-murkowski/66728/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bucked her party</a> to mount <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/09/murkowski-announces-write-in-bid-042353" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a write-in campaign</a> and, remarkably, <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2010&amp;fips=2&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won that November</a>. (She <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2016&amp;fips=2&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also beat Miller in 2016</a>, when he ran as a Libertarian.) So she’s overcome a stern intraparty challenge before, although it took an <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/09/the-abcs-of-murkowskis-write-in-bid-042897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extraordinarily unusual campaign</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Murkowski very well could have faced another defeat in a traditional party primary this year if not for the <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/RCV.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 voter initiative</a> that altered Alaska’s electoral system. But instead, <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/election/2022/prim/HD1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all 19 Senate candidates</a> will run on the same ballot in the state’s Aug. 16 primary, and the top-four vote-getters will then advance to the November election, where ranked choice voting will determine the winner. (Perhaps not coincidentally, her allies <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/04/15/congressional-campaigns-political-insiders-raise-1-million-for-pro-murkowski-pac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted this change</a>.) Murkowski is all but guaranteed a spot in the general election as an incumbent with near-universal name recognition. Tshibaka, whose campaign has spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/AK/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millions of dollars</a>, will presumably also advance. It’s hard to say who exactly will join them, as the only semi-notable Democrats in the race are <a href="https://mustreadalaska.com/alaska-native-leader-and-former-seward-mayor-edgar-blatchford-files-for-u-s-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Seward Mayor Edgar Blatchford</a> and <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2022/05/13/retired-educator-chesbro-files-senate-only-democrat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patricia Chesbro</a>, a member of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough Planning Commission.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given the lack of a high-profile Democrat, the ranked choice voting process seems likely to set up a contest between the two leading Republicans. And in early July, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/stw221frq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska Survey Research released a poll</a> that looked at how a hypothetical general election could play out if it involved Murkowski, Tshibaka, Chesbro and Dustin Darden, a candidate of the Alaskan Independence Party. As the table below shows, Tshibaka led in rounds one and two, but once the ranked choice votes were reallocated in the third and final round, Murkowski won by 4 percentage points, although that gap <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was inside the margin of error</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But how support shifted under ranked choice voting lays out a path that Murkowski likely has to follow to win. Initially, Murkowski attracted 43 percent of registered Democrats, who made up 17 percent of voters in the ASR poll, and 44 percent among the 52 percent of the sample who weren’t affiliated with either major party. But she won only 17 percent among registered Republicans, who made up 31 percent of voters, while Tshibaka won nearly all remaining GOP support. Things didn’t shift much in the second round after dropping the last-place candidate, Darden, and reallocating his votes. Then, after dropping Chesbro for the third round, Murkowski jumped ahead by gaining almost all the outstanding support of Democrats — about 97 percent of them — and 60 percent of independents. This was just enough to outdistance Tshibaka, who ended up with slightly over 80 percent of Republican voters and 40 percent of independents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For both Murkowski and Tshibaka, this poll offered hope and a warning. Murkowski clearly has a path to victory and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Senate forecast</a> currently gives her an 85 in 100 shot at winning.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> But given the overall margin, the survey suggests she can’t afford to lose much more Republican support if she wants to come out on top. Moreover, because of how ranked choice voting works, Murkowski needs to ensure that Democratic voters who back a Democrat in the first round actually name Murkowski as their second choice. In top-two primary states, we’ve seen that races between two candidates from the same party <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379420301116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can often produce</a> a fair amount of <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2016/1024/Speaking-Politics-phrase-of-the-week-roll-off" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ballot roll-off</a> — that is, not casting a vote for a race — among voters from the party not represented. So if many Democrats don’t list a second preference this November, it could spell doom for Murkowski.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tshibaka, meanwhile, may look to win over more Trump voters to defeat Murkowski. After all, the poll’s final round found the incumbent still received support from almost 1 in 5 Trump voters in a state <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=2&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where Trump won 53 percent in 2020</a>. So it’s no wonder that <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/07/09/thousands-gather-in-anchorage-for-trump-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump held a rally</a> in Anchorage on July 9 in support of Tshibaka, after the ASR poll was in the field. Tshibaka could also seek to make more significant inroads with rural Alaskans, who backed Murkowski at around 70 percent in the survey. That group includes many Alaska Natives, who <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/racial-and-ethnic-diversity-in-the-united-states-2010-and-2020-census.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make up about 15 percent</a> of the population and <a href="https://mcimaps.com/lisa-murkowskis-electoral-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have traditionally</a> been <a href="https://www.indianz.com/News/2010/022964.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big supporters</a> of Murkowski — however, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/us/politics/murkowski-tshibaka-alaska-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tshibaka is making a concerted effort to win over</a> Alaska Natives by making campaign stops far afield in the vast state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this is just one election poll, so don’t take it as gospel. An <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1520455429767110656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier poll</a> from ASR in April found Murkowski ahead by 10 points, 55 percent to 45 percent, so Tshibaka may have already gained ground. We have limited data to work with in Alaska. Still, the recent surveys from ASR and Morning Consult give us a window into not only how Democrats and independents will be a critical part of Murkowski’s reelection hopes but also why she can’t afford to alienate the remaining few Republicans who back her.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Following the last Jan. 6 congressional hearing, 44 percent of Americans believe Trump’s actions around the insurrection were illegal, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/07/27/americans-trump-illegal-actions-jan6-poll">according to YouGov/The Economist polling conducted July 23-26</a>. Unsurprisingly, that stance varies greatly by party: 79 percent of Democrats consider the then-president’s involvement illegal, compared with only 12 percent of Republicans. These figures haven’t wavered much in a month, as YouGov has conducted similar polling every week since July 2. </li></ul><ul><li>Twenty-one percent of Americans reported taking on extra work in light of inflation, <a href="https://civicscience.com/one-fifth-of-adults-taking-on-more-work-due-to-rising-costs/">per a July 19-20 survey from Civic Science</a>. That share jumps to almost half among 18- to 24-year-olds: 29 percent say they’ve changed jobs or taken on additional work to increase their income, while 18 percent say they formerly did not work but have sought employment to offset the rising cost of living. This trend is especially prominent among those who live with their parents; 16 percent of that group have taken on a new job, and 22 percent have added work or changed jobs.  </li></ul><ul><li>Ownership of cryptocurrency is plateauing, perhaps even decreasing, nationally, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/cryptocurrency-insights-hub/">according to research from Morning Consult published July 26</a>. Seventeen percent of American adults said they own it in some form, a figure that has remained roughly stagnant month over month in 2022. Generation Z’s stake in this market is specifically on the decline: 28 percent of Gen Z reported owning cryptocurrency in January, compared with 22 percent this month. Americans still invested continue to hold out their positivity: Asked in January what they expected the price of bitcoin to be in July, cryptocurrency owners estimated it at around $50,000. In reality, the value has hovered in the low $20,000s this month. </li></ul><ul><li>About two-thirds (65 percent) of Americans believe voters should be mandated to prove their citizenship status to vote, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/07/26/voting-laws-americans-support-requiring-proof-citi">per a July 16-19 YouGov/The Economist survey</a>. This includes about half of Democrats (48 percent) and a sweeping majority of Republicans (88 percent). Sixty-one percent of Republicans also say that voter fraud is a more widespread issue nationally than barriers preventing eligible voters from casting their ballots, while 60 percent of Democrats say the latter is a bigger concern. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">As was the case when we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched the forecast a month ago</a>, the Deluxe version of FiveThirtyEight’s midterm model still rates the battle for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control of the Senate as a “toss-up.”</a> But within that category there’s been modest, but consistent movement toward Democrats. Their chances of winning the Senate <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now stand at 55 percent</a>. That’s up from 47 percent from forecast launch on June 30. It’s also up from 40 percent in a retroactive forecast dated back to June 1.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our retroactive forecast is based on information that would have been available at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-senate-change-711-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-senate-change-711-2.png"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is matched by Democrats’ improved position on the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they would support in a congressional election. Democrats are now essentially tied with Republicans in our generic ballot polling average, after having trailed by 2 to 3 percentage points over most of the late spring and early summer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/generic-ballot-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/generic-ballot-2.png"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the Classic version of our forecast — which doesn’t use the race ratings published by the Cook Political Report and other expert groups — the movement toward Democrats has also been steady. There, their chances sit at 67 percent, up from 56 percent at launch on June 30 and 52 percent in the June 1 retroactive forecast. (We discussed some of the differences between our Classic and Deluxe versions of the forecast on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-the-polls-and-pundits-disagree-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week’s podcast</a>, and it’s a theme we’ll revisit in the coming weeks.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s always hard to know how much to emphasize relatively modest movement in the forecast. Sure, the difference between a 47 percent chance and a 55 percent chance might matter to a poker player (raises hand) or an options trader. But in practical terms, the story is the same, which is that the battle for Senate control is highly competitive and neither party has a clear advantage.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/losing-big-midterms-biden-87269933</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">In this case, though, I think the shift is worth discussing. One reason, as I’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed previously</a>, is that our model is designed to be pretty conservative — at least at this relatively early stage of the race.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not feel early if you’re a political junkie, but for many voters, it is — consider that more than a dozen states still haven’t held their primaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> It takes a fair amount of data to get the model to change its opinion in July, more so than in October. So although the shift may be modest, it probably isn’t just statistical noise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other reason is that there are plenty of news developments to help explain the shift; the political climate would appear to be getting better for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The most important of these is probably the Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Democrats have made a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fairly clear improvement in the polls since then</a>. And although <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-birth-control-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion may not be as important</a> to voters as the economy, it did rank as the <em>second</em>-most-important issue in this week’s <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/national/2022/7_28_2022_embargoed_marginals.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=4F682989707021DD87FA56D227603197F8E43228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk/USA Today poll</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s not the only factor working in Democrats’ favor, though. Consider:</p>



<ul><li>Congress has been surprisingly productive, with bipartisan bills on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/us/politics/gun-control-bill-biden.html">gun safety</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/china-competitiveness-and-chip-bill-passes-house-goes-to-biden.html">funding semiconductor manufacturing</a> passing, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/07/28/democrats-manchin-spending-deal-climate/">possible breakthrough on a Democratic spending and climate bill</a> and movement toward bills <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/possibility-10-senate-republicans-back-sex-marriage-bill/story?id=87125015">to codify same-sex marriage</a> and to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/20/electoral-count-act-reform-bipartisan">reform how presidential elections are certified</a>.</li><li>It’s not clear how much the Jan. 6 hearings have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/cnn-poll-january-6-trump/index.html"><em>changed</em> public opinion</a>, but they have highlighted an issue where the public is relatively sympathetic toward Democrats, with 79 percent of voters saying former President Donald Trump acted <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22121480/rel10a-january-6-committee71.pdf">either unethically or illegally</a> in a new CNN poll.</li><li>COVID-19 — an issue that was something of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/">a no-win for President Biden</a> — is on the backburner for most voters. In the aforementioned Suffolk/USA Today poll, so few voters mentioned COVID-19 as their most important issue that it wasn’t broken out as one of the 25 issues respondents named. Cases remain high, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html">deaths are low compared to earlier stages of the pandemic</a>.</li><li>Granted, the economic news hasn’t been good for Democrats. Most voters <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/07/13/recession-outlook-us-economy-data/">think the economy is in a recession</a>, even though the bureau that determines recessions in the U.S. hasn’t declared one yet and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/07/27/who-decides-recession/">may never do so</a>. But at the same time, some highly visible indicators have improved: <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/national-average-falls-but-rebounding-gas-demand-and-crude-prices-may-change-its-course/">Gas prices are down</a> and the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/">stock market has been in a rebound over the past five to six weeks</a>.</li></ul><p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-dems-energizing-abortion-evens-midterms-equation-silver-86558599</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">There are a lot of “ifs” here. Economists are <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1552725169944215552?s=20&amp;t=f3IyVCE0TuGPJU5RFpjd_A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsure about what to expect with inflation going forward</a>; the next COVID-19 variant could be more deadly; there are still a lot of hurdles to clear in the Democratic legislative progress (*cough* <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-28/senate-tax-climate-drugs-bill-in-limbo-as-sinema-reviews-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Kyrsten Sinema</a> *cough*); and Democrats may not be able to sustain the same level of attention currently given to abortion and the Jan. 6 hearings. Plus, Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remains terrible</a> to the point where even most Democrats say they <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/cnn-poll-biden-2024/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">want a different presidential nominee in 2024</a>. But ultimately, Democrats have a lot of <a href="https://upswingpoker.com/glossary/out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outs</a> to a winning hand in the Senate, even if they’re <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drawing thin in the House</a>.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In today’s Congress, Republicans are still <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18905/us-congress-by-race-ethnicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more likely than Democrats to be white</a>. But after the midterm elections in November, a record number of Black Republicans could be headed to Capitol Hill. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to reports, the National Republican Congressional Committee says <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/black-republicans-race-deconstructed-newsletter/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81 Black candidates</a> are running on the GOP ticket for the U.S. House in this year’s primaries, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-hopes-to-add-black-lawmakers-to-house-11603892455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a marked increase from the 2020 primary cycle</a>. Not all of these candidates will make it to Congress, though, as a number have already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-30.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost their primary elections outright</a> or <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/06/22/chris-west-sanford-bishop-georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in runoffs</a>. But it’s likely that, come January, Republicans will have the most Black members serving together in the U.S. House since 1889. The U.S. Senate could also <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Data/Black-American-Representatives-and-Senators-by-Congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break a record</a> this year: If Republican nominee Herschel Walker <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/black-republicans-race-deconstructed-newsletter/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeats Sen. Raphael Warnock</a> in Georgia, and Sen. Tim Scott wins his reelection bid in South Carolina, there will be two Black Republicans serving in the upper chamber — the highest number ever.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There wasn’t always a dearth of Black Republican representation in Congress. Seven served in the House in the 43rd (1873-75) and 44th (1875-77) congresses,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/10029" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Counting the Senate&lt;/a&gt;, the 44th Congress had eight Black Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> but following the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/compromise-of-1877" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of the Reconstruction era</a>, in 1877, Black representation declined. This didn’t begin to reverse in earnest until 1995, when two Black Republicans served together in the House again. The number of Black GOP representatives never increased beyond that, though, and many congresses had no Black Republicans at all. Next year will likely be different, however, as at least four Black Republicans — including two incumbents, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and Rep. Burgess Owens of Utah — are favored to win seats in the House this fall, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a>. But as you can see in the chart below, representation of Black Republicans still has a ways to go.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Following <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/american-civil-war-ends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the end of the Civil War</a>, in 1865, and <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/slavery-abolished" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official end of slavery</a> later that year, the first Black lawmakers were elected to the House: Jefferson Franklin Long of Georgia and Joseph Hayne Rainey of South Carolina.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/20291" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sen. Hiram Rhodes Revels&lt;/a&gt; of Mississippi also served in the 41st Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>19</sup></a> In total, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/black-leaders-during-reconstruction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than a dozen Black men</a> — all Republicans — served in the House during the Reconstruction period thanks to the newfound political power of emancipated men in the South, who <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got the right to vote in 1870</a>.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican Party then isn’t what it is today. At the time, Black people &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-catch-22-facing-black-voters-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;were overwhelmingly aligned with the GOP&lt;/a&gt; because it was known as &lt;a href="https://origins.osu.edu/history-news/republican-party-and-african-americans-real-history?language_content_entity=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the party of President Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, who was credited with fighting to end slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Reconstruction era was, in short, a time of extraordinary promise when it came to civil rights of Black people and all Americans. The <a href="https://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/36815?current_search_qs=%3Fsubject%3DThirteenth%2BAmendment%26PreviousSearch%3D%26CurrentPage%3D1%26SortOrder%3DDate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13th</a>, <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/14th-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14th</a> and <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/15th-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15th amendments</a> were all ratified during this period, and the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-Civil-Rights-Bill-of-1866/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civil Rights Bill of 1866</a>, which expanded eligibility for U.S. citizenship, was enacted. All four provisions were notable in that they helped ensure Black Americans — at least the men — could finally participate in the political process. But this period proved short-lived, as <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/compromise-of-1877" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reconstruction ended abruptly in 1877</a>, and with it, so did the federal government protections that safeguarded Black Americans’ newly won freedoms. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, a backlash among white Americans gripped the country, and Black men were heavily intimidated and even <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/civil-rights-history-project/articles-and-essays/voting-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terrorized when they tried to vote</a>. Many southern states passed laws requiring poll taxes or literacy tests to vote, and what came to be known as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/freedom-riders-jim-crow-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Crow laws</a> enforced racial segregation across the region and diminished the political clout of Black men. Mississippi even <a href="https://www.crf-usa.org/black-history-month/race-and-voting-in-the-segregated-south" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rewrote its state constitution</a> to circumvent the 15th Amendment, which gave Black men the right to vote. Black voter participation fell as a result of these combined efforts, and by the 51st Congress (1889-1891), only three Black Republicans were serving in the House: Reps. <a href="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1901-1950/Representative-Thomas-Miller-of-South-Carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Ezekiel Miller</a> of South Carolina, <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/16682" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Mercer Langston</a> of Virginia and <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/10878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry Plummer Cheatham</a> of North Carolina. By March 1901, during the 57th Congress, <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Temporary-Farewell/Introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there were no Black congressmen</a> at all. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t to say there was no Black representation in Congress in the first half of the 20th century. In 1934, <a href="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1901-1950/Representative-Arthur-Mitchell-of-Illinois-wins-the-general-election,-defeating-incumbent-Oscar-De-Priest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Black Democrat was elected</a> to the House, and that number has steadily grown over the years — to <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Data/Black-American-Representatives-and-Senators-by-Congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 60</a> today. As I’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-catch-22-facing-black-voters-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported previously</a>, though, the dynamics of the two major parties didn’t really start to take shape until <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Keeping-the-Faith/Party-Realignment--New-Deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around the 1930s</a>, when programs intended to help communities of color — such as those in Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s <a href="https://www.pbs.org/tpt/slavery-by-another-name/themes/fdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Deal</a> — ushered in a wave of Black voters’ switching their party loyalty to Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/gillespie-andra.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andra Gillespie</a>, a political science professor at Emory University, told me that Black Americans first became a critical part of the Democrats’ coalition under Roosevelt, as they were more adversely affected by the Great Depression. But it was in the 1960s, Gillespie said, that Black voters became “almost unanimously Democratic,” as that was when the Republican Party started to take more staunchly conservative stances on civil rights issues — Sen. Barry Goldwater, the frontrunner for the 1964 Republican presidential nomination, for instance, announced that he would <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/politicaljunkie/2010/06/17/127915281/flashback-friday-this-day-in-1964-goldwater-says-no-to-civil-rights-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote against the comprehensive civil rights legislation</a> that the House had passed earlier that year. Fast-forward to today <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Data/Black-American-Representatives-and-Senators-by-Congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and only two</a> Black Republicans are serving in the House: Donalds and Owens. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, there has long been an opportunity for Republicans to expand their ranks of Black members of Congress, but it wasn’t until recently that the party really began investing in Black candidates, according to <a href="https://history.jhu.edu/directory/leah-wright-rigueur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leah Wright Rigueur</a>, a professor of history at Johns Hopkins University. She told me that the Republican Party is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting to capitalize</a> on some Black voters’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-black-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party</a>, and that there’s now a larger pool of potential candidates for Republicans to recruit and support. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of primary race winners, 13 Black Republicans are guaranteed a spot on the November ballot this year in House races.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For races through July 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> It’s possible that number could grow, too: John James, for instance, is <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/21/democrats-make-insurrection-john-james-key-issues-district-10-primary/7659015001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored to win the Republican primary</a> for Michigan’s 10th Congressional District in August. And if he does, our forecast gives him a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">69 in 100 chance of winning</a> the general election.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What will happen with other Black GOP candidates is less clear, though. Take Jennifer-Ruth Green, an Air Force veteran and political novice running who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/air-force-veteran-black-woman-republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the Republican nomination</a> for Indiana’s 1st District. <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/15/todd-young-jennifer-ruth-green-indiana-republicans-political-fundraising-money/65374441007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She has currently out-fundraised</a> the incumbent, Democratic Rep. Frank J. Mrvan, but the seat she is vying for has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/indiana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan lean of D+7</a>, which makes this race a challenge. Our forecast, however, still rates this race as competitive and currently gives Green <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/indiana/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 31 in 100 chance</a> of winning the general election.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s about it as far as potential Black Republican representation. In total, only a fraction of the 13 Black Republican nominees so far look likely to defeat their Democratic opponents this fall. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Winning their races is only half the battle for Black Republicans, though, as they often struggle with acceptance within the Republican Party and face challenges in trying to prove <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-racist-white-voters-often-favor-black-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their conservative ideological bona fides</a>. In some cases, Wright Rigueur told me, especially if they’re running in districts that are predominately white, they must <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/john-james-michigan-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid issues of race</a> and stick to party talking points. “They are very much in line with where the party is and haven’t strayed from the party line,” Wright Rigueur said. She added that they may have slightly more freedom to talk about these issues if they’re running in a district with a more diverse constituency but that, ultimately, they steer clear of “controversial topics on race and racial antagonisms.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Racism is another factor working against Black Republicans trying to make a name for themselves in the party. Even prominent Black Republicans like Scott, the South Carolina senator <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tim-scott-joe-biden-business-race-and-ethnicity-health-789601bb6410b6756358893bea33d5a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen to give the party’s response</a> to President Biden’s address to Congress, have reported receiving <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/23/tim-scott-messages-racist-police-336650" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a barrage of racist comments</a>. Unlike Democratic politicians of color, however, Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often downplay racism</a> within their own party. For instance, in a closed-door meeting with colleagues, Scott shared racist voicemails he and his staff had received but publicly declared that “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/latest-biden-us-turning-peril-possibility-77377556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America is not a racist country</a>.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, national Republicans have taken some steps to foster a more diverse delegation. For example, the super PAC <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00668905/1602986/se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Patriots PAC</a>, which supports conservative candidates, and super PAC <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00654764/1601785/se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Values First</a> spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Jeremy Hunt, a Black Republican and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/20/jeremy-hunt-georgia-black-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Army captain</a> who ran for a Georgia U.S. House seat earlier this year, even though he ultimately lost his primary bid. Some critics <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/07/gop-attempt-hype-diversity-fails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viewed this</a> as a fig leaf that obscures the party’s past and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current obsession with white grievance politics</a>, but <a href="https://twitter.com/GOP/status/1490332956703043590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans have hailed</a> the shift as a slow but genuine transformation of a party that was established on an anti-slavery platform and is now attempting to recruit and support candidates of color who could represent and appeal to a broader range of voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s evidence that these efforts might be working — albeit slowly — too. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed slightly better with Black voters</a> than he did in 2016. And, more recently, some polling suggests that Black voters are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/04/biden-black-voters-softer-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">souring on Biden</a> and are more <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-poll-biden-ukraine-inflation-midterms-11646975533?st=7rw6mltwcrhukb6&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open to supporting GOP candidates</a> this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Republican Party still has relatively few Black candidates running, though, because at the end of the day, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few Black Americans identify as Republicans</a>. This also isn’t exactly a new opportunity, as the GOP has long had the chance to peel socially conservative Black voters away from the Democratic Party, but that has proved <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-catch-22-facing-black-voters-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easier said than done</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>“</strong>Since 1964 or so, the Republican Party has had an image problem on issues related to race, and when that gets brought up, it often gets dismissed by members of the party as being mere ‘identity politics,’” Gillespie said. “And because of that, the Republican Party hasn’t really been able to reach out to Black voters and potential candidates in a meaningful way.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So don’t lose the forest for the trees. While the number of Black Republicans elected to Congress this year might be a historic milestone, it wouldn’t change the fact that Black voters are overwhelmingly Democratic and that Republican officials — and their base — are still overwhelmingly white. In other words, the Republican Party still has a long way to go.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Think your office softball league is serious? Try the <a href="https://www.congressionalbaseball.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Baseball Game</a>. Most summers <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/Statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1909</a>, Democratic and Republican members of Congress have taken a break from legislating to play a friendly game of the national pastime, and through many <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ups</a> and <a href="https://tht.fangraphs.com/congress-finds-peace-in-the-church-of-baseball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downs</a>, it has slowly evolved into a huge event. Last year’s game, played under the lights at Nationals Park, attracted a reported 14,348 spectators and raised <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/09/29/it-was-a-good-night-for-republicans-at-the-congressional-baseball-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> for charity.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since 2009, the Democratic team has dominated with a 10-2 record, thanks largely to its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/shohei-ohtani-mlb-all-star/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shohei Ohtani-esque</a> two-way threat, former Rep. Cedric Richmond. According to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cbgstats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics that I keep of the game</a>, the former Morehouse College baseball player hit .654/.757/1.077 in his Congressional Baseball Game career — <em>and</em> went 8-0 with a 2.64 ERA on the mound. Richmond was truly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-calculated-advanced-stats-for-the-congressional-baseball-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a league of his own</a>; his 2.8 wins above replacement<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which I calculated myself using &lt;a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/library/misc/war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FanGraphs’s formula&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, until sabermetricians start treating the Congressional Baseball Game as seriously as they do MLB contests, WAR for the Congressional Baseball Game does not include defense or baserunning (other than stolen bases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> over that span were seven times as many as any other player.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Richmond is no longer on the Democratic roster, having <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_336046da-28ea-11eb-b99a-b782344834ee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned from Congress</a> to work in President Biden’s White House — and the Congressional Baseball Game is suddenly a toss-up again. Last year’s contest, the first without Richmond since 2010, was a nail-biter for all seven innings and ended in a <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1443396756507615233?s=20&amp;t=L28qv3EiYWu0tI_pjkKKUg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13-12 Republican victory</a> — the GOP’s first win since 2016. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this year’s game — which takes place on <a href="https://www.mlb.com/nationals/tickets/congressional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thursday at Nationals Park</a> — should be competitive, too. Several up-and-coming lawmakers have emerged to replace Richmond as the game’s star players, and they are a bipartisan crop. Of the 10 most valuable players on the <a href="https://www.congressionalbaseball.org/teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 rosters</a> (according to total WAR since 2009), five are Democrats and five are Republicans.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Even with Richmond’s departure, the Democrats are left with several solid players. Veteran Rep. Adam Smith, who has played in the game on and off since 1997, and Rep. Eric Swalwell, a speedster with 10 career stolen bases, should both return to the lineup this year. But the anchor of that lineup — and the new holder of the title “best congressional baseball player” — is Democratic Rep. Jimmy Panetta. He’s produced 0.4 WAR in his four-game career thanks to a rare combination of power (two triples and one inside-the-park home run) and speed (five stolen bases). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sophomore Rep. Tom Malinowski has also been a valuable table-setter for Democrats: He’s gotten on base in five of his seven career plate appearances, and he’s legged out six stolen bases. Meanwhile, freshman Sen. Jon Ossoff is something of a poor man’s Richmond: In his Congressional Baseball Game debut last year, he went 1-for-2 at the plate and gave up just one run in two innings of relief on the mound. (In a league where the average ERA is 6.47, this qualifies as ace material.) Most impressively, he struck out three Republicans and walked none, making an excellent case to start this year’s game for Team Blue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the Republican side, for years there was really only one standout player: Ironman Rep. Kevin Brady, who has played in 24 consecutive congressional baseball games and hit a workmanlike .379/.550/.448 since 2009. (Sadly, with his decision <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/14/kevin-brady-congress-texas-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to run for reelection</a>, the 2022 game will be his last.) But recently, he’s been joined by some exciting newcomers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That list starts with Rep. Greg Steube, the GOP’s answer to Richmond. He’s been the Republican starting pitcher in the last two games, and while he hasn’t exactly been dominant (with a 9.19 ERA and a 1.25 strikeout-to-walk ratio), he has been a valuable innings-eater, throwing more than 100 pitches in each outing. And at the plate, he has been aces: He’s got four hits in seven at-bats, including what was likely the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/30/gop-rep-greg-steube-hits-home-run-in-congressional-baseball-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first over-the-fence home run</a> in the Congressional Baseball Game since 1997.</p>

Greg Steube Home Run at Congressional Baseball Game" width="712" height="401" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qIfZMVoIZlI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Amazingly, Rep. Anthony Gonzalez is an even better hitter: The <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GonzAn00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former NFL player</a> is 6-for-8 in his two games, with two doubles and an inside-the-park home run. His .891 <a href="https://library.fangraphs.com/offense/woba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wOBA</a> leads all active players with more than one plate appearance. Unfortunately for the GOP, though, this is also his last game: As one of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump, he is <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/09/us-rep-anthony-gonzalez-announces-he-wont-seek-re-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retiring from Congress</a> at year’s end.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two freshman Republicans also impressed in last year’s game. Rep. Blake Moore went 2-for-4 with a single and an inside-the-park home run, while Rep. August Pfluger knocked three singles in his four at-bats. Pfluger, who <a href="https://www.colemantoday.com/news/lt-colonel-august-pfluger-in-coleman/article_e879f7c0-1548-11ea-9760-6b3d6d17bc84.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">played Division I baseball</a> for the Air Force Academy, also pitched 1 ⅓ innings on the mound.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We won’t have to wait long to see which quintet leads its team to victory this year; if you’re not attending the game in person, you can watch it live on C-SPAN and Fox Sports 2 on Thursday night at 7 p.m. Eastern. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">How are you, as a voter of color, weighing who you’ll vote for — or which party you’ll support — ahead of this year’s midterm elections?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Too often, media coverage is focused on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/mcconnell-wants-win-suburbs-defusing-cultural-hot-buttons-trump-party-rcna36266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suburban voters</a>, which can implicitly — or explicitly — be a stand-in for white, middle-class voters. But we’re interested in seeing what makes voters of color tick. How are Black voters in Trump country versus those living in suburbia deciding who they’ll support this year? Are religious beliefs or values affecting the vote choice of Latino voters, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-latinos-really-moved-toward-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who lean Democratic</a> but might be open to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-gops-grievance-politics-might-not-turn-off-conservative-latino-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">socially conservative messaging</a>? And what’s motivating Asian American voters, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/09/asian-americans-are-the-fastest-growing-racial-or-ethnic-group-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the county’s fastest growing</a> racial or ethnic group, <a href="https://socialinnovation.ucr.edu/news/2020/08/18/latest-polling-data-shows-indian-americans-continue-lean-towards-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who are fairly</a> <a href="https://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/aavs2020_crosstab_CAonly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split between the two political parties</a>? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While we know many of these groups vote overwhelmingly Democratic, it’d be a mistake to paint <em>all </em>voters of color with such a broad brush. No one group is a monolith, which is why we want to unpack how various voters of color — and we know there are many races and ethnicities we missed above — are thinking about different policy and political issues headed into this fall, including how those issues might affect their vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, we’re not trying to predict electoral trends and outcomes, but we <em>do </em>hope to tell stories about how different voters of color are processing politics. To tell these stories better, though, we’d like to hear from you. Please fill out the survey below and tell us a little bit about yourself and why you think you’d be a good fit for this column. We might get in touch!</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, around 60 percent of 18- to 29-year-old voters <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cast a ballot for Joe Biden</a>, making them the most Democratic-leaning voting group by age. This was in line with recent presidential elections, too, as young voters have been the <a href="http://every%20presidential%20contest%20dating%20back%20to%202004(opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab)/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely age group to vote Democratic</a> in every presidential contest dating back to 2004. Yet this group, once Biden’s best demographic, has now shown the largest drop in support.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why have young Americans soured so dramatically on President Biden? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From my conversations with experts who study the political beliefs of young Americans and an examination of recent polling data, I’ve identified a few key factors that help explain the large drop-off in support. First, of course, they are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-2000-americans-about-their-biggest-concern-the-resounding-answer-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerned about the economy</a> — a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major driver of disapproval</a> of Biden overall — and about the direction the country is headed. But young Americans also have some concerns that set them apart from older Americans. They are particularly worried about achieving financial independence and other markers of adulthood, for instance. They are also <a href="https://www.vox.com/23042037/joe-biden-young-voters-disapprove-progressive-gen-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frustrated with the Biden administration’s limited progress</a> on issues like tackling climate change and forgiving student debt, which many young people care a lot about. Moreover, Biden <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-defines-the-sanders-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t the first choice</a> of young voters in the 2020 Democratic primary, so his approval among this group may have been soft to begin with. The question now is whether this dissatisfaction with Biden will affect whether young Americans vote in the midterms, a potentially significant factor in determining <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how poorly the midterms could go</a> for Democrats since young people <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/26/18516645/2018-midterms-voter-turnout-census" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted at a higher rate</a> in 2018 than in previous midterms and overwhelmingly backed Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some ways, Biden’s decline among young Americans mirrors his standing overall. As Biden’s approval rating has fallen to 38 percent in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> 18- to 29-year-olds’ approval of Biden has also slipped to 37 percent, with 53 percent disapproving of his job performance, based on data from FiveThirtyEight’s polling database.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One small positive for Biden is that unlike older Americans, many young people might not have an opinion of his job performance. For instance, YouGov/The Economist polls often find around 15 to 20 percent of 18- to 29-year-old Americans are “not sure” whether they approve of Biden, whereas less than 5 percent of Americans 45 and older say the same. Note, however, that the share of 18- to 29-year-olds who don’t have an opinion about Biden can vary &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; from pollster to pollster; additionally, most of the data we have for 18- to 29-year-olds surveys adults rather than registered voters. That said, Biden’s downward trend is apparent among other groups of young Americans commonly used by pollsters, such as 18- to 34-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> </p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/about/staff/john-della-volpe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Della Volpe</a>, director of polling for the Harvard Institute of Politics, told me Biden’s slide “is part of the broader disillusionment that Americans and young people are having about the country and the state of politics.” (Della Volpe <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/15/iop-pollster-joins-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consulted on Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign</a>.) In fact, Harvard’s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/o0enme1afskt2yx/2022_Spring_Harvard_IOP_Youth_Poll_Banners.xlsx?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spring 2022 poll</a> of 18- to 29-year-olds found that 36 percent of the respondents who disapproved of Biden (56 percent overall) said “ineffectiveness” best explained their disapproval.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As is true of other Americans, the economy seems to be an area where young Americans are particularly unhappy with Biden. In last week’s <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/k4maehoie4/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a> survey, 34 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds approved of the way Biden was handling jobs and the economy, slightly lower than the 37 percent who approved of his economic performance overall. Similarly, polls released in mid-July by <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/Fox_July-10-13-2022_Complete_National_Cross-Tabs_July-17-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> (of registered voters) and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22088874-cnn-poll-biden-approval-rating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSRS/CNN</a> (of adults) found that less than 30 percent of American adults under 35 approved of Biden’s work on the economy (28 percent in Fox News, 25 percent in SSRS/CNN), compared with about 30 percent overall. Meanwhile, in Harvard’s spring 2022 poll, 74 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said inflation had affected their personal finances “a lot” or “some,” and <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=rocU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation has worsened since then</a>. The Fox News and SSRS/CNN polls found that about 1 in 5 of those under 35 approved of Biden’s handling of inflation, compared with 25 percent overall.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Such economic concerns may be particularly acute for young people because they’re just getting their lives off the ground. A <a href="https://murmuration.org/static/Looking-Forward-with-Gen-Z.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey report on Generation Z</a>, conducted by Della Volpe’s company Social Sphere on behalf of Murmuration, found earlier this year that 35 percent of Americans age 15 to 25 said financial independence was their most or second-most important life aspiration, ahead of other priorities such as having a fulfilling career or being married. “Financial independence was number one — not wealth independence — but literally doing something that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/article/independence-for-young-millennials-moving-out-and-boomeranging-back.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millennials couldn't do</a>, which is leave their parents’ home,” said Della Volpe. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that so many young people are prioritizing making ends meet is understandable considering how many are worried they will have a tough time doing so. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/28/most-in-the-u-s-say-young-adults-today-face-more-challenges-than-their-parents-generation-in-some-key-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center poll</a> found last year that 80 percent or more of adult Americans under 30 — a group that also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes some younger millennials</a> — said it was harder for young people to afford to pay for college tuition, buy a home or save for the future compared with their parents’ generation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Woven into these larger financial concerns are worries about student debt, a particularly big issue for 18- to 29-year-olds because many have student loan debt to pay off — 34 percent according to the <a href="https://educationdata.org/how-many-people-have-student-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education Data Initiative</a>, roughly twice the rate of any other age group. Moreover, <a href="https://money.com/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-promise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite campaigning on student-loan forgiveness</a>, Biden has yet to make any progress on relieving student debt, which exemplifies another possible source of the president’s struggles with young Americans — the overwhelming sense that he hasn’t done what he promised. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-continue-win-georgia-2022-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-86847505</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Harvard’s spring poll found, for instance, that 14 percent disapproved of Biden “for not following through on campaign promises,” second only to “ineffectiveness” on a list of reasons for their disapproval. This feeling was especially prominent among the 29 percent of young Democrats who disapproved of Biden overall, as nearly one-third of them fell into this camp, similar to the share who cited his ineffectiveness. In that same poll, about 3 in 5 respondents said that the government should cancel at least some student loan debt. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Della Volpe felt student debt was an area where Biden could change young Americans' perception that the administration hasn’t made progress on key issues. “Discretely addressing his promise to deal with the student debt crisis would be the fastest thing to reset that conversation,” said Della Volpe. Biden is reportedly considering <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/25/heres-why-federal-student-loan-forgiveness-could-be-coming-soon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issuing an executive order</a> to forgive some debt given Congress’s inaction on the issue, but it’s possible such an order <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/politics/scotus-climate-change-biden-student-loans/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be shot down</a> by the Supreme Court.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These sorts of challenges — a conservative judiciary and a sharply divided Congress — make transformational change so difficult for Biden to accomplish. This, in turn, has dampened the spirits of some younger liberals. Take something like climate change, which young people <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/do-younger-generations-care-more-about-global-warming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly cite as a top issue</a> and want to see action on. It’s an issue, though, that has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/20/biden-seeks-to-revive-climate-change-agenda-00046968" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven challenging for the Biden administration</a> to act on and has led to a growing sense of frustration among young Democrats. In May, 26 percent of 18- to 29-year-old Democrats<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including independents who leaned toward the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> told Pew that the Biden administration’s climate policies were <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/07/14/americans-divided-over-direction-of-bidens-climate-change-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking the country in the wrong direction</a>, compared with just 9 percent of Democrats 65 or older.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even when the White House seemingly gets a political “win,” like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/us/politics/gun-control-bill-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan gun-control law</a>, it still struggles to highlight this for young people. “It would be really helpful for the White House to play up what just happened with gun policy since that is something that youth groups and gun-violence-prevention groups have been touting,” said <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/people/abby-kiesa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abby Kiesa</a>, deputy director of the Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. But a poll conducted by <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/06/28115735/2206176_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_06-29-22_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> right after Congress passed the bill on June 24 found that 60 percent of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Generation Z</a> registered voters (18- to 25-year-olds) had not seen, read or heard much or anything at all about the legislation, which was much higher than for other age groups.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-dems-energizing-abortion-evens-midterms-equation-silver-86558599</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible, though, that some young Americans’ dissatisfaction with Biden predates his presidency. After all, among 18- to 29-year-olds, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won 63 percent of the Democratic presidential primary vote up through mid-March, while Biden won just 17 percent, according to exit polling.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on data from Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. Five states were excluded because they held caucuses (Iowa and Nevada), were entirely vote-by-mail and had pre-election polls (Colorado and Washington) or &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/joe-biden-now-has-a-clear-path-to-be-the-democratic-nominee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;had sampling problems&lt;/a&gt; (Michigan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>21</sup></a> Della Volpe pointed out that by the end of the 2020 campaign, young people did like Biden, but recent polls suggest he has lost his appeal: YouGov/The Economist, <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/07/19133716/2207093_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_07-20-22_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> and <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3852" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a> all found Biden’s favorability rating underwater among the pollsters’ youngest respondents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The million-dollar question now is whether young Americans’ negative views of Biden will affect their voting behavior this November. When it comes to turnout, the answer, at this point, looks like no. <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/spring-2022-harvard-youth-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard’s spring poll</a> found that 36 percent of young Americans said they would “definitely” vote, which was similar to the 37 percent who said the same in <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/spring-2018-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spring 2018</a>. And that midterm experienced <a href="http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically high turnout</a>, including among 18- to 29-year-olds, 36 percent of whom voted according to the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Election Project</a>. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394628/americans-intensity-running-high-midterms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other polls</a> have <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/06/27/roe-v-wade-democratic-enthusiasm-midterm-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also found</a> that other groups in the electorate are engaged, perhaps auguring high midterm turnout once again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Despite the frustration that young people have about government in general, they just feel more connected to voting,” said Della Volpe. “I think this is just a new era of engagement.” At the same time, even though 36 percent said in that Harvard survey they would “definitely” vote, 43 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said they didn’t believe their votes “make a real difference,” and 57 percent said “politics today are no longer able to meet the challenges our country is facing.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the rampant skepticism about politics among young people, Kiesa also felt fairly upbeat about their participation: “Indicators of youth engagement in a midterm election are pretty good, relatively speaking.” She pointed out that a lot of young people were already registered to vote thanks to 2018 and 2020 being such high-water marks for youth voter engagement. Moreover, according to <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-states-youth-voter-registration-lower-now-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIRCLE’s data</a>, about half the states in the country now have more 18- to 24-year-old registrants than they did in 2018, including many battleground states such as Arizona, Michigan and Nevada. Kiesa did note that it’s not all good news, however, as registration among 18- and 19-year-olds is lagging.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just a matter of how many young people show up to vote; it’s also whom they vote for, and on that point the data is less clear. In 2020, roughly 60 percent of voters under 30 backed Biden, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GIovkPfwUJvFZeFPdOi0fK8Rr7aOVFCYBzrlMG4Vjro/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Pew</a>, and in 2018, around 70 percent backed Democratic U.S. House candidates. It’s hard to imagine, though, that Democrats will get that level of support in 2022, as polls suggest Democrats’ leads are much narrower with those under 30. For instance, YouGov/The Economist’s survey last week found Democrats leading 52 percent to 23 percent among registered voters 18 to 29, while the GOP pollster <a href="http://echeloninsights.com/wp-content/uploads/July-2022-Omnibus-EXTERNAL-Crosstabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echelon Insights</a> gave them an edge of just 49 percent to 42 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kiesa told me that young people remain the most likely to vote Democratic, but added, “Young people are not blind party followers. We've learned that they're really focused on issues and really focused on how to urgently make change on those issues.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why Biden and Democrats’ policy shortcomings on some key issues, along with the broader discontent over the economy, could help Republicans narrow the margins among younger voters this year — whether through shifts in turnout or some degree of vote-switching. Suffice it to say that young Americans <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/index.php/yesi2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could play a major role</a> in determining a number of close elections in 2022.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this month, FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-very-unpopular-it-may-not-tell-us-much-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted an interesting disconnect</a> between two pieces of information most commonly used to predict the upcoming midterms: the president’s approval rating and polls of the generic congressional ballot (which ask Americans whether they plan to vote for the Republican or the Democratic candidate this fall).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On one hand, President Biden is historically unpopular: As of July 25 at 5 p.m. Eastern, he had an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average approval rating</a> of 38 percent and an average disapproval rating of 57 percent — a net approval rating of -19 percentage points. You have to go back to Harry Truman to find a president with a net approval rating that bad at this point in his term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic-congressional-ballot polls</a> are pretty close. As of the same date and time, Republicans had an average lead of 1 point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those two numbers feel difficult to reconcile. Biden’s approval rating suggests that the national mood is extremely poor for Democrats, while the generic-ballot polling suggests that the political environment is only slightly Republican-leaning. But in reality, these two types of polls aren’t in opposition as much as you might think. They’re separate metrics, and a look back at past midterm elections shows they don’t always line up. But history also shows that when they do diverge, one is more predictive than the other.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, it’s kind of an obvious point, but presidential-approval polls and generic-ballot polls are measuring two different things. Presidential-approval polls are like a referendum — a simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down on the commander in chief. But generic-ballot polls are a choice, pitting the president’s party against a tangible alternative — one that, in this case, is <em>also</em> pretty unpopular (according to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/the-republican-party-favorability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a>, only 41 percent of registered voters view the GOP favorably). Biden may not look good to people in the abstract, but some may still prefer his policies to the alternative. For example, plenty of Democrats <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3852" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tell pollsters</a> that they disapprove of Biden’s performance, but almost all of them also say in the same breath that they will vote Democratic in the midterms (that is, if they turn out to vote — an important caveat).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Second, and unsurprisingly considering the first point, it’s not unusual for presidential-approval polls and generic-ballot polls to disagree. Just take a look at where the polls stood on July 25 in the past four midterm election years: 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on FiveThirtyEight’s &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;presidential-approval-rating average for then-President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2018 generic-ballot polling average&lt;/a&gt;, as well as what our presidential-approval and generic-ballot polling averages &lt;em&gt;would have &lt;/em&gt;said had they existed in 2006, 2010 and 2014, applying our current methodology to the polls at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1258" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.0726-01-use.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.0726-01-use.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.0726-01-use.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.0726-01-use.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1872" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.0726-01-mob-use.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.0726-01-mob-use.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.0726-01-mob-use.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.0726-01-mob-use.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In 2010, there was little daylight between the two numbers. Then-President Barack Obama’s net approval rating was -2 points, and Democrats trailed by 3 points in generic-ballot polls. In 2018, the gap was a little wider but still nothing to write home about — just 4 points. That year, then-President Donald Trump’s net approval rating was 12 points underwater, while his Republicans trailed by 8 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in 2006, then-President George W. Bush and congressional Republicans were both in dire straits. But there was actually a decent-size, 7-point gap between Bush’s net approval rating (-19 points) and the GOP’s deficit on the generic congressional ballot (12 points). And in 2014, the difference between the two numbers was impossible to ignore. Obama’s net approval rating was -11 points, but Democrats actually <em>led</em> in generic-ballot polling by 2 points. That 13-point gap approaches the current 18-point gap between Biden’s numbers and those of congressional Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s possible that Biden’s approval rating and the generic-ballot polling will come into better alignment as we get closer to the election. But again, historically, this hasn’t always happened. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1286" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.-726-02-use.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.-726-02-use.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.-726-02-use.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.-726-02-use.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="2120" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.-726-02-mob-final.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.-726-02-mob-final.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.-726-02-mob-final.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rakich.APPROVAL-VS-GENERIC.-726-02-mob-final.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In 2018, the gap wasn’t very large to begin with, but it did close from 4 points on July 25 to 2 points on Election Day. Trump’s net approval rating improved a bit, from -12 points to -11 points, while Republicans lost ground on the generic ballot, which went from D+8 to D+9.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in 2006 — when the gap was a not-insignificant 7 points as of July 25 — little changed. Bush’s net approval rating fell from -19 points to -20 points, and the generic-ballot polling moved in tandem from D+12 to D+14. By Election Day, the gap between presidential approval and the generic ballot was 6 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2010, the gap also didn’t change much — but to the extent it did, it actually got wider. Granted, this was the year that presidential-approval polls and generic-ballot polls were just 1 point apart on July 25. And by Election Day, they were still in close agreement, albeit 2 points apart. Obama’s net approval rating went from -2 points to -4 points, and the Republican lead on the generic ballot increased by a bit more than that (from R+3 to R+7).</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-dems-energizing-abortion-evens-midterms-equation-silver-86558599</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, in 2014 — perhaps the best analog to our current situation — Democrats’ standing in generic-ballot polls did deteriorate from a 2-point lead on July 25 to a 2-point deficit on Election Day. This was a bit closer to Obama’s -11-point net approval rating, which barely changed over the course of those three and a half months. But there was still a 9-point gap between the two numbers, so it’s hard to say they truly converged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In summary, it’s not unusual for presidential-approval polls and generic-ballot polls to still be several points apart on Election Day. So that leaves us with one final question: Which of those two indicators should we be paying more attention to?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The answer is the generic ballot. Unsurprisingly, polls asking Americans which party they plan to vote for in the midterms have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically been more predictive of the midterm results</a> than polls asking about presidential approval. As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-very-unpopular-it-may-not-tell-us-much-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silver concluded</a>, the president’s popularity just doesn’t add all that much new information when you have polls that directly ask the question you want answered.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the past four midterm elections, the generic-ballot polling average has missed the national popular-vote margin for the House of Representatives by an average of only 2.5 points, while the presidential-approval polling average has “missed” (we’re using scare quotes because presidential-approval polls are not intended to be measuring this) the national popular vote margin by 5.5 points. In each of those cycles, regardless of whether the two numbers were in sync or not, the generic-ballot polling average came closer to the final vote margin — sometimes significantly closer.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On the surface, this appears to be good news for Democrats in 2022. Since generic-ballot polling is currently much better for the party than Biden’s approval rating, that would seem to suggest that a “red wave” is not in the cards. But not so fast. Go back and look at the chart above showing how the polling has changed from July to Election Day. While the generic-ballot polling and presidential-approval polling don’t always converge, there <em>is</em> one other pattern that’s evident: The generic-ballot polling got worse for the president’s party in all four cycles. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-spent-1m-ad-candidate-fivethirtyeight-86844594</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">That matches our previous research finding that the president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically loses ground on the generic ballot</a> as a midterm election approaches — a trend that’s especially pronounced when a Democratic president is in office. As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silver also wrote</a> when unveiling our 2022 midterm forecast in June, most generic-ballot polls at this stage are conducted among registered voters, but by the fall they will be conducted among likely voters — a group that will probably be disproportionately Republican, both because Democrats tend to be more infrequent voters in general and because, currently, more Republicans than Democrats say they are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_3O21aNiBc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enthusiastic to vote</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So Republicans may lead in generic-ballot polls by only 1 point on average today. But by November, their lead will probably be a few points wider. And while that wouldn’t be as disastrous for Democrats as it would be if everyone’s midterm vote was dictated by how they rated Biden’s job performance, it would still be a great result for Republicans.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The conventional wisdom that Republicans will do well in the midterms hasn’t always been borne out in the polling numbers, which have shown Democrats leading in numerous competitive Senate races around the country. That discrepancy can also be seen in the relatively large gap between FiveThirtyEight’s Lite and Deluxe midterm forecasts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of “Model Talk” on the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Nate Silver and Galen Druke discuss what to make of this and answer listener questions about the forecast model. They also touch on the health of the polling industry and how much President Biden’s success in a potential 2024 primary election hangs on Democrats’ performance at the midterms.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It may not be immediately obvious how the fight over abortion rights is tied to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-twisted-logic-behind-the-rights-great-replacement-arguments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“great replacement” theory</a> — the debunked conspiracy theory <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/29/republicans-great-replacement-theory/9798199002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted by some Republican politicians</a> who claim that Democrats support more immigration to <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Replacement-Theory-Explainer-1122.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“replace” white American voters</a>. But the explanation for, say, an alleged gaffe that overturning the constitutional right to an abortion is a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/26/1107710215/roe-overturned-mary-miller-historic-victory-for-white-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“historic victory of white life”</a> or a concern that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb7ad/cpac-head-promotes-abortion-ban-to-stave-off-great-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not enough white babies are being born</a> in the U.S. can be found in the history of the anti-abortion movement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The movement to end legal abortion has a long, racist history, and like the great replacement theory, it has roots in a similar fear that white people are going to be outnumbered by people believed to hold a lower standing in society. Those anxieties used to be centered primarily around various groups of <a href="https://sociology.northwestern.edu/documents/faculty-docs/faculty-research-article/Beisel-AbortionRaceandGender.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European immigrants</a> and <a href="https://www.oah.org/tah/issues/2016/november/abolishing-abortion-the-history-of-the-pro-life-movement-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly emancipated slaves</a>, but now they’re focused on non-white Americans who, as a group, are on track to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/03/14/the-us-will-become-minority-white-in-2045-census-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerically outpace non-Hispanic white Americans</a> by 2045, according to U.S. Census projections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been decades since the anti-abortion movement first gained traction — and the movement has changed in certain ways — but this fundamental fear has never left, as demonstrated by attacks on people of color, such as the shooter in Buffalo, New York, who expressed <a href="https://time.com/6178135/buffalo-shooting-abortion-replacement-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concern about the declining birth rates</a> of white people. That’s because the anti-abortion movement, at its core, has always been about <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3593062?refreqid=excelsior%3A049b6ba3e9676e6800ad23f79d748a6d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upholding white supremacy</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Throughout colonial America and into the 19th century, abortions were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10297561/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fairly common</a> with the help of a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/scarlet-letters-getting-the-history-of-abortion-and-contraception-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">midwife or other women</a> and could be obtained until the point that you could feel movement inside, according to Lauren MacIvor Thompson, a historian of early-20th-century women’s rights and public health. Most abortions were induced through <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/the-complex-early-history-of-abortion-in-the-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">herbal or medicinal remedies</a> and, like other medical interventions of the time, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/02/alitos-anti-roe-argument-wrong-00036174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weren’t always effective or safe</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the dynamics surrounding the procedure changed by the mid-19th century, as America’s elites began to fear a rising tide of immigrants from <a href="https://sociology.northwestern.edu/documents/faculty-docs/faculty-research-article/Beisel-AbortionRaceandGender.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ireland, Italy and other European countries</a> (people often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viewed as “inferior”</a>), <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3593062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffragists seeking new freedoms</a> and recently freed Black people, whom these elites feared were <a href="https://sociology.northwestern.edu/documents/faculty-docs/faculty-research-article/Beisel-AbortionRaceandGender.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reproducing at higher rates</a> than the white population. Laws limiting abortion, it was believed, would ultimately force middle- and upper-class white women — who had the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/the-complex-early-history-of-abortion-in-the-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most access to detect and terminate</a> unwanted pregnancies — to bear more white children.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There were concerns that these other groups were demographically outpacing white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant women. And so they thought to limit the bodily autonomy of white women and limit access to contraception in order to force them to have children. That they felt would keep up with the demographic birth rate,” said Alex DiBranco, the co-founder and executive director of the Institute for Research on Male Supremacism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It took time for the anti-abortion movement to attract supporters, and unlike today, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/05/the-truth-about-the-religious-right-now-celebrating-the-end-of-roe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religious groups</a> were not originally an active part of it. Still, momentum built as a small but influential number of physicians began arguing that licensed male doctors — as opposed to female midwives — should care for women throughout the reproductive cycle. In the late 1850s, one of the leaders of the nascent anti-abortion movement, a surgeon named <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/horatio-robinson-storer-1830-1922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horatio Robinson Storer</a>, began arguing that he <a href="https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&amp;context=jmurj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t want the medical profession to be associated</a> with abortion. He was able to push the relatively new American Medical Association to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/the-complex-early-history-of-abortion-in-the-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support his cause</a>, and soon they were working to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XO9nBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA749&amp;ots=afWFuRXHGB&amp;dq=american%2520medical%2520association%2520abortion%25201850s&amp;pg=PA749#v=onepage&amp;q=american%2520medical%2520association%2520abortion%25201850s&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delegitimize midwives and enforce abortion bans</a>. In an 1865 essay issued by order of the AMA, Storer went so far as to say of white women that “upon their loins depends the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Why_not/31wXAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=alien&amp;pg=PA85&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future destiny of the nation</a>.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://eh.net/encyclopedia/fertility-and-mortality-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Declining white birth rates, along with the</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/06/1103372543/abortion-was-once-common-practice-in-america-a-small-group-of-doctors-changed-th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising eugenics movement</a> — a now-discredited pseudoscience focused on the genetic fitness of white Americans — were connected to the practice of abortion, and this helped bolster flawed, racist arguments for a total ban of the procedure. “The physicians trying to pass these anti-abortion laws were concerned about how abortion was a ‘danger’ to our society and the ways we want our country to be,” said Shannon Withycombe, a professor of history at the University of New Mexico who studies 19th-century women’s health.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Their tactics worked. By the 1900s, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abortion-america-visual-timeline/story?id=85588254" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion was illegal in every U.S. state</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite this, though, women continued to seek abortions. It wasn’t until the 1960s and 1970s that women’s access to safe and legal abortions began to change. Feminist activists, armed with college and law-school degrees, began to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/06/25/1960s-provide-post-dobbs-path-securing-legal-abortion/?request-id=fadcde5b-90a6-45d2-a53d-85be0138b807&amp;pml=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocate for overturning or relaxing these bans</a>. They argued that the existing laws made abortion less safe for women and that reproductive health, including abortion, was necessary for women’s equality. Public attitudes started to shift then, too, and in 1967, Colorado became the first state to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lessons-from-before-abortion-was-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberalize its abortion laws</a>, allowing exceptions for the life or health of the pregnant person. Other states followed suit, and by 1972, a total of 13 had similar laws. Four states had repealed their anti-abortion laws entirely. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, of course, in 1973, the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that abortion was a constitutional right. But while the decision in Roe overturned the nation’s remaining abortion bans, it didn’t address the underlying forces that had helped establish them, which brings us to today, as the anti-abortion movement is once again front and center following the court’s decision to overturn Roe.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">These old fears have risen to the fore again in part because the country is experiencing a demographic change similar to what we saw at the turn of the last century. For instance, the U.S. birth <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-low-can-americas-birth-rate-go-before-its-a-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rate has been declining</a>, although this has more to do with women having greater access to contraception, education and career opportunities than it has to do with abortion rates. But immigration levels are also high, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/20/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost as high</a> as they were at the turn of the 20th century, again spawning a fear that white Americans will be displaced in an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly multiracial nation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polling suggests these fears have taken hold among the American electorate, too. In a December 2018 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, a 38 percent plurality of Americans said the U.S. becoming more diverse would “<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/03/21/views-of-demographic-changes-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weaken American customs and values</a>.” This way of thinking is especially prevalent among Republicans, who said by 59 percent to 13 percent that having a majority nonwhite population would weaken rather than strengthen the U.S. (Twenty-seven percent said this would not have much impact either way.) According to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in December, 47 percent of Republicans (compared with 22 percent of Democrats and 22 percent of independents) agreed with the statement that “there is a group of people in this country who are <a href="https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Immigration-Report_V15.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants</a> who agree with their political views.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And these anxieties over immigration have become explicitly connected to the birth rate in some statements from prominent Republicans. In 2017, when he was representing Iowa’s 4th Congressional District in the U.S. House, Steve King <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/13/politics/steve-king-babies-tweet-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directly made the connection</a>: “You cannot rebuild your civilization with somebody else’s babies. You’ve got to keep your birth rate up, and that you need to teach your children your values.” More recently, in May, Matt Schlapp, the head of the Conservative Political Action Coalition, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb7ad/cpac-head-promotes-abortion-ban-to-stave-off-great-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">echoed a similar sentiment</a> when he advocated for a ban on abortion. And in June, Illinois Rep. Mary Miller called the end of Roe a “historic victory for white life” at a rally with former President Donald Trump, who still holds a tight grip on the Republican Party and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/14/trump-2024-announcement-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may run for president again</a>. The crowd responded to Miller’s statement with applause, though her spokesperson later said she had misspoken and meant to say “victory for a right to life.” (Miller did not try to correct herself onstage, however.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, other, more extreme far-right groups have visibly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/24/white-nationalists-are-flocking-to-the-us-anti-abortion-movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined with the anti-abortion movement</a>. This year, the white nationalist Patriot Front showed up at March for Life rallies in <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/white-supremacist-group-crashes-anti-abortion-rally-in-the-loop/2724861/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/patriot-front-s-anti-abortion-advocacy-march-life-sends-clear-ncna1287952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington, D.C.</a> “The white nationalist segment of anti-abortion organizing is really long-standing,” said DiBranco, of the Institute for Research on Male Supremacism. “And, in recent years, there’s been more of an emboldenment about using great replacement rhetoric or similar kind of rhetoric around to what they might call ‘white genocide’ or demographic change.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even on its own terms, though, the logic of tying the anti-abortion movement to the racist great replacement theory is deeply convoluted — and downright inaccurate. For instance, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-abortion-has-changed-since-1973/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer women are seeking abortions</a>, and women of color — particularly those who are Black — are more likely than white women to seek an abortion. Moreover, it’s likely that we’ll see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/overturning-roe-v-wade-could-make-maternal-mortality-even-worse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more women of color die</a> as abortions become more limited, in spite of arguments from some on the far right that a near-total abortion ban is a <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/19/16906928/black-anti-abortion-movement-yoruba-richen-medical-racism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>good </em>thing for people of color</a>, primarily Black people. In fact, according to analysis published in the December edition of the population-research journal “Demography,” a hypothetical total abortion ban would lead to <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/58/6/2019/265968/The-Pregnancy-Related-Mortality-Impact-of-a-Total" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more pregnancy-related deaths among non-Hispanic Black people</a> than among any other racial group. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But<a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/seyward-darby/sisters-in-hate/9781549199905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> logic is not the point in many of the mainstream racist arguments around restricting abortion access. “They tried to twist themselves into logical scientific explanations for all of these things. But they basically had to just make stuff up to justify what they wanted, which is for women — especially women of color — to not have any rights,” said Thompson, the historian.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Nicola Beisel, a professor emerita at Northwestern University who studies cultural sociology, sex and gender, women’s ability to have children is treated as a resource instead of a matter of bodily autonomy or a right, which is why opposing abortion is part of the bigger conversation about who is having children. “If women’s reproductive capacity is a resource, the question is, who’s going to get to use it? And for whom?” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is why anti-abortion activists pressed until Roe was overturned, and they likely won’t stop there. It’s clear that the people who want to criminalize abortion also want to limit access to contraception, DiBranco said. “So it’s a part of a political project and a cultural project around controlling women’s autonomy, and in some cases, managing demographic change through that.”</p>]]></description>
