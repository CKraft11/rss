<p data-paragraph="main">“Are <em>you</em> a racist?” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Do you hate Mexicans?”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are the two questions J.D. Vance, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/jd-vance-wins-republican-nomination-us-senate-ohio-84483088" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the GOP’s nominee for Senate in Ohio</a>, posed to voters in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1511311385543815180?s=20&amp;t=tEvCGX2E3KV-QZLmiqLDPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary election ad</a> in which he accused the media of vilifying Republicans like him for wanting a border wall — and falsely claimed that President Biden had established an “open border” that was “killing Ohioans” because “more illegal drugs and more Democrat voters [were] pouring into this country.” The ad was purposely incendiary, designed to push <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-keep-losing-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader culture-war issues</a>, like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/republicans-politics-us-immigration-midterm-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a>, that the GOP has used time and time again to galvanize their primary base, typically <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-2018-primaries-project-the-demographics-of-primary-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older white voters</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vance is a particularly egregious example of this trend, but <a href="https://www.axios.com/gop-candidates-anti-immigrant-rhetoric-vance-laxalt-7c3d1559-a409-4e0a-a4d8-ee7dc04e6ac8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s hardly alone</a>. Promoting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial grievance politics</a> to appeal to conservative (and often white) voters who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceive a threat</a> to their status at the top of the racial hierarchy is a popular conservative political tactic — one that can have devastating and deadly consequences. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Case in point: the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/shoppers-regulars-retired-police-officer-victims-buffalo-shooting/story?id=84731033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass shooting at a supermarket</a> in a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-shooting-0475a5bd971d23a4e0a13ef840650bb1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predominantly Black neighborhood</a> of Buffalo, New York, on Saturday, which police say was a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/us/buffalo-supermarket-shooting-sunday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racially motivated hate crime</a>. According to reports, the suspect also promulgated the baseless “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/politics/replacement-theory-buffalo-what-matters/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great replacement</a>” conspiracy theory, which claims that non-white people are being brought to the U.S. and other Western countries to “replace” and “disempower” white people to achieve a political agenda. In the attack, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/buffalo-supermarket-shooting-05-17-22/h_dde5248154ded799d66474e30153f594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 of the 13 shooting victims were Black</a>; 10 of them died. And because a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-2022-midterm-elections-covid-health-media-2ebbd3849ca35ec76f0f91120639d9d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable minority of Americans</a> believe in certain tenets of the replacement theory, these messages of white victimhood and the idea that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/28/gop-primary-america-racist-2024-500680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“America is not a racist country”</a> aren’t going anywhere; we’re likely to hear these talking points from the GOP in 2022 and beyond.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[Vance is] trying to give voters a sense of license to have these anxieties, discomforts and sometimes even prejudiced views,” said <a href="https://schar.gmu.edu/profiles/jgest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justin Gest</a>, a professor of policy and government at George Mason University. “Those are precisely the politics that he’s bristling at, and there are going to be voters who appreciate him giving them the license to believe what they believe.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But where does this leave the GOP in its <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/01/21/does-the-gop-have-an-opening-with-black-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efforts</a> to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/-clock-ticking-democrats-defense-republicans-pursue-latino-voters-rcna16745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeal to voters of color</a>, especially the Latinos whom Vance and others have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/us/politics/gop-vote-fraud-immigrants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely cast as bogeymen</a> despite then-President Donald Trump making <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22436307/catalist-equis-2020-latino-vote-trump-biden-florida-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable gains among them</a> in 2020? At first glance, this messaging may seem at odds with a GOP that has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/03/republicans-are-trying-to-rebrand-themselves-as-working-class-heroes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to rebrand itself</a> in fits and spurts as the party of the working class for <em>all</em> Americans. Yet, as counterintuitive as it sounds, these messages of racial grievance could also appeal to voters of color, especially Latino voters,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all Latinos identify as people of color, and polls are not consistent in how they capture Latinos’ different racial and ethnic identities. Pollsters often treat Hispanic heritage as an ethnicity, asking about race separately, which would allow people to identify as both Black and Latino, white and Latino, or Asian and Latino. But Hispanic is sometimes treated as its own race, which may lead respondents who identify as both Hispanic and white, Black or another race to self-select out of the Hispanic/Latino group. Other times, respondents are simply asked if they identify as Hispanic or Latino. When possible, we use the U.S. Census Bureau’s two-part approach, which asks first about Hispanic identity and then racial identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> who were already open to supporting Republican candidates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Republicans know that white voters are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/26/what-the-2020-electorate-looks-like-by-party-race-and-ethnicity-age-education-and-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upwards of 80 percent of their voters</a>, so everything is targeted toward them,” said <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/fraga-bernard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernard Fraga</a>, a political scientist at Emory University. At the same time, though, he said this kind of message might not turn off minority voters, especially the few who have been receptive to voting for Republicans. “They might be willing to accept that [messaging] because they align with the party on other kinds of policy issues.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How Latino voters <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-no-such-thing-as-the-latino-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think of themselves politically varies</a> depending on where they live, how long their family has been in the U.S., and whether they went to college. Those fault lines are true of most voters in the U.S., but on some issues, Latino voters are unique and might be more open to the GOP’s messaging on race. For instance, while Latinos overall <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-latinos-really-moved-toward-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lean Democratic</a>, some are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/389093/hispanic-americans-party-updated-analysis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open to supporting Republicans</a> or identify as conservative, particularly on certain immigration policies and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/spanish-election-2020-disinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race-related issues</a>, like <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/27/support-for-black-lives-matter-declined-after-george-floyd-protests-but-has-remained-unchanged-since/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Black Lives Matter</a>. Some polling and research also suggests that large chunks of conservative Latino adults <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/us/latino-hispanics-for-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy into American nationalism</a> and believe that issues of race <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2021/11/04/latinos-divided-on-whether-race-gets-too-much-or-too-little-attention-in-the-u-s-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get too much attention</a> in the U.S. today, so they could be receptive to the idea that Democrats are out of step with their views.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think a lot of Latinos are turned off by the hateful rhetoric toward them, but part of the reason that Latinos are a swing vote and that Trump was able to do so well with them in 2020, is because there are a lot of Latinos who think there is too much identity politics going on, think of themselves more as ‘Americans’ and are receptive to the idea that Democrats are always going around calling people racist,” said <a href="https://www.menlo.edu/about/find-an-expert/melissa-michelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melissa Michelson</a>, a political scientist at Menlo College.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to a March 2021 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2021/11/04/latinos-divided-on-whether-race-gets-too-much-or-too-little-attention-in-the-u-s-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from the Pew Research Center</a>, 57 percent of Republican or Republican-leaning Latino adults<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this poll, Latinos included anyone who reported Hispanic identity regardless of their race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> agreed with the statement that “too much attention is paid to race and racial issues in our country these days.” Meanwhile, only 28 percent said that discrimination based on race or skin color was a “very big problem” facing the country today. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for Black Lives Matter was another big dividing line: In September, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/27/support-for-black-lives-matter-declined-after-george-floyd-protests-but-has-remained-unchanged-since/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a> found that among all racial and ethnic minority groups polled, Latino adults<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this poll, Latinos included anyone who reported Hispanic identity regardless of their race. White, Black and Asian respondents were limited to those who indicated they were only one race and not Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> were the <em>least</em> likely to say they supported the movement. While 60 percent of Latino adults said they did support Black Lives Matter, that’s significantly less than the share of Asian adults (68 percent) and Black adults (83 percent) who said the same. (By comparison, only 47 percent of white adults said they supported Black Lives Matter.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The results of the past two presidential elections also suggest that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-exploited-status-anxiety-within-the-latino-community/2020/11/06/3164e77c-1f9f-11eb-b532-05c751cd5dc2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overtly racist rhetoric</a> about Mexicans and immigrants won’t turn off certain Latino voters. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew’s 2020 validated voter analysis</a>, Biden won Latino voters<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this poll, Latinos included anyone who reported Hispanic identity regardless of their race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> by only 21 percentage points — 59 percent to 38 percent — significantly less than Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 38-point edge over Trump among Latino voters in 2016, when she won by 66 percent to 28 percent. Immigration was <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as important to voters</a> as it was <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/07/07/4-top-voting-issues-in-2016-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2016</a>, but it’s still notable that Republicans managed to win a sizable portion of Latino voters while simultaneously leaning into <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/30/918483794/from-debate-stage-trump-declines-to-denounce-white-supremacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messages of white nationalism</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, plenty of Latino voters are conservative on immigration issues — particularly in swing parts of the country, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/border-grievance-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Texas</a> — but pollsters noted that not all Latino voters want the same immigration policies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Latinos generally express high levels of support for a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented and a DACA-like program, but support varies around border-security issues,” said <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/staff/mark-hugo-lopez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Hugo Lopez</a>, Pew’s director of race and ethnicity research. “When you start talking about asylum seekers and offering asylum to those coming from Central America, for example, we’ve found that there’s a significant share of Latinos who feel like there’s not an obligation to help those people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This may be because many Latinos in the U.S. are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/americans-way-number-latinos-think-are-undocumented-poll-finds-rcna2464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not undocumented</a> or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/08/20/facts-on-u-s-immigrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigrants themselves</a> — in fact, their families may have been in the country for several generations — or they don’t know many immigrants personally. According to a March 2021 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/14/around-four-in-ten-latinos-in-u-s-worry-that-they-or-someone-close-to-them-could-be-deported/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a> study, 60 percent of Latino adults said they didn’t worry very much or at all that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported. The longer their family had been in the U.S., the less likely they were to worry. A large majority (81 percent) of third- or higher-generation Latino adults in the U.S.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia or one of the five U.S. territories whose parents were both born in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia or one of the five U.S. territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> — according to Pew’s 2021 National Survey of Latinos, about one-third of registered Latino voters fall into this category — said they did not worry about deportations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The farther you are away from the immigration experience, the more likely you are to be removed from immigration issues and maybe even agree with Republicans’ messaging on race and immigration,” said <a href="https://government.cornell.edu/sergio-i-garcia-rios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sergio Garcia-Rios</a>, a professor of government and Latino studies at Cornell University. “Latinos in Republican states especially are likely to embrace Republican views and remove themselves from the groups being attacked.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, according to a separate November poll from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2021/11/04/measuring-the-racial-identity-of-latinos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a>, close to 3 in 5 Latino adults (58 percent) say that they’re white themselves (although, of course, as I’ve written previously, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what it means to identify as “white”</a> is often a limitation of census categorizations). But at the very least, that means it’s possible that certain Latino voters will embrace messages of white grievance, or at least won’t be completely turned off by it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you’re a Latino who identifies as ‘white’ or ‘American,’ it often doesn’t matter what country you’re from or where your ancestors came from,” Michelson told me. “You can still have a strong white, American identity that makes you receptive to these messages because you want to be part of that community that’s ‘protecting’ the United States from these alleged threats. It’s nice to be on the winning team, and white people in America are still the winning team.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, once Latino adults start to identify more as white than Latino, it’s easy to appeal to them using the same fear-mongering, us-versus-them language that Republicans use on white voters. Fear — like the threat of an “open border” or “illegal drugs” coming into the U.S., as Vance said in his ad — can be a <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/apa/2020/fear-motivator-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powerful motivator</a> in getting voters to cast a ballot one way or the other. And by raising the threat of people crossing the border with Mexico, Republicans might be able to successfully win over both racially conservative white <em>and</em> Latino voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not to say that this messaging necessarily works. As Michelson said, a lot of Latinos are turned off by this rhetoric.<strong> </strong>But even if grievance politics doesn’t <em>attract</em> Latino voters to the GOP, that doesn’t mean it will drive them away, either. As is the case for <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans as a whole</a>, the No. 1 issue for Latino voters is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/11/hispanic-voters-say-economy-health-care-and-covid-19-are-top-issues-in-2020-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy</a>, and that concern may outweigh concerns about racism in the GOP when they’re casting their vote. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Experts were really blindsided by the reduced margins of Democratic victories among Latinos in 2020. So there’s still a scramble to better understand Latino identity, solidarity and what’s driving Latino votes,” Gest, the George Mason University professor, said. “Among some Latinos, we have noticed a clear willingness to overlook some of this rhetoric and anti-immigrant nativism if they feel like their economic prospects will be boosted by Republican candidates.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was especially true in 2020, when Trump won over more Latino voters, in part because there was a sharp drop in how they prioritized immigration issues as well as a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2021-12-17/economy-covid-drove-latino-voters-toward-trump-2020-essential-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steep climb in their emphasis</a> on economic issues instead. In fact, economic messaging may even be an extra potent antidote to the GOP’s racism for immigrants in particular. “The evidence is that the children of immigrants buy into this ‘American dream’ rhetoric and might even be more receptive” to it than later generations, said Fraga, the Emory University professor. “It’s the children of immigrants who have had relative economic success who say that the Republican message — economy, religion, jobs — appeals to them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are plenty of reasons, then, why the GOP’s racism may not be the poison pill for Latino voters that it seems. It’s still important to remember that a majority of Latino voters are Democratic and likely don’t appreciate Republican candidates’ racist rhetoric about them. And despite some Latinos being more conversative on issues of race, many are still liberal on these issues. For instance, according to a December <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-12/Axios%20Latino%20Write%20Up%201pm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios/Ipsos/Telemundo</a> survey, 57 percent of Latino adults did not agree with the statement that America is <em>not</em> a racist country. Moreover, 61 percent agreed that Latino or Hispanic people do not have the same opportunities in the U.S. as white people. So, even if grievance politics appeals to some Latino voters — or at least doesn’t turn them away — this tactic could still backfire. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevertheless, this won’t necessarily deter Republicans from using this kind of racist messaging. Remember, grievance messages aren’t crafted with voters of color in mind — they’re intended to galvanize an overwhelmingly white GOP base whom Republicans often prioritize at the cost of losing other voters, said Fraga. That’s why even if the GOP as a whole were to decide it’s bad politics to demonize Latinos, specific candidates like Vance, who is running in a state that is only <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/OH/PST045221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 percent Latino</a>, would still likely lean into this kind of messaging.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The national party might think, long-term, that it’s better to be more welcoming to Latinos given demographic trends. But it doesn’t matter what the national party wants or envisions as its long-term future since you can’t stop individual candidates from running these types of campaigns and having short-term victories that capitalize on racist stereotypes and economic fears,” Michelson said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s an open question, then, as to whether this messaging will backfire. It’s possible that it will repel more Latino voters than it attracts. It’s possible that it will appeal only to a specific swath of Latino voters. After all, those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/border-grievance-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living along the U.S.-Mexico border</a> have different political priorities than those living in New York. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, it’s possible, too, that this messaging just might work.</p>]]></description>

				</div>
			


<p data-paragraph="main">In 1935, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2748835" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup first asked</a> Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/169682/years-ago-first-gallup-poll.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what they thought</a> was <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most important problem</a> facing the United States. In the midst of the Great Depression, about 3 in 5 Americans mentioned concerns related to the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fast forward nearly 90 years, and countless pollsters regularly ask Americans what’s top of mind for them. But on their own, answers to this question don’t really tell us that much. Issues like “the economy” or “political polarization” are often too broad to define. Moreover, two voters might both say something like “crime” is important to them, but for very different reasons. It’s why understanding how these issues factor into how Americans vote is so challenging.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But understanding how the most important issues facing the country factor into voters’ lives — including what they really know about the issues — is exactly what FiveThirtyEight aims to do. In partnership with <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos</a>, FiveThirtyEight will conduct six polls between now and Election Day, interviewing the same group of around 2,000 Americans about the biggest issues facing the country. By interviewing the same people each month, using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we’ll get a better sense of whether Americans’ concerns are changing and the extent to which those worries will influence the country’s political environment as we move closer to the 2022 midterm elections. We’ll do deep dives into what Americans name as their most pressing concerns and also conduct one FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll after the election to see where things stand after the country has voted.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, the answer to what Americans are most worried about is pretty straightforward: inflation. In the first FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted April 27-May 5, 2022, among a sample of 2,006 adults that was weighted to match the general population. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.6 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> 52 percent of Americans said the most important issue facing the country was inflation. We asked Americans this question in a variety of ways,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> but regardless of how we asked it, the top answer was always the same: inflation.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans are most worried about inflation" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SzAiZ/12/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="617" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that a larger percentage of Republicans than Democrats or independents in our poll said they were concerned about inflation. But inflation still led the way regardless of party identification: About two-thirds of Republicans selected it as a top issue, as did about half of all independents and slightly more than 40 percent of Democrats. Inflation was the top issue for respondents of all age groups and for both men and women, too. Now, some Americans did find other issues more important, though. For instance, 43 percent of Black Americans listed “race and racism” as a top concern, while 37 percent named inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But inflation in particular is casting a pall over the lives of Americans of all stripes. “At the end of the month, it’s harder to buy food and pay bills and keep the kids with clothes and sneakers on them,” a Hispanic 48-year old Democratic woman from New York told us. “No matter how much they raise wages, costs exceed them,” said a white 60-year old Republican woman from Pennsylvania. And as a 36-year old man of color from Arizona who identified as independent put it: “It is impacting my spending power and the future wealth of myself and generations that come after me, including my own children.” Moreover, with prices continuing to rise — inflation was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/11/business/inflation-cpi-report-april" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.3 percent in April</a> — these concerns aren’t likely to go away anytime soon.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And most Americans don’t feel like things have improved for them financially, either. Overall, 32 percent said their personal financial circumstances had worsened over the past year, 52 percent said things were about the same, and just 12 percent said they were doing better. Tellingly, 41 percent said they had made a major change to how they live, including a majority (56 percent) of households making less than $50,000 per year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many in our survey said they were driving less, taking fewer vacations or just being more cost-conscious at the grocery store. Put more simply, many Americans are watching what they spend. “I just noticed that I'm really checking my bill a lot more. I actually maintain a spreadsheet just to track how my costs have gone up,” said James Bassett, a 48-year old white man from South Carolina. “It's definitely made me a lot more mindful and taken a little bit more time to process what I need and what I don't need.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the most part, though, Americans have a decent understanding of what inflation and the broader economic situation looks like in the U.S. For instance, a plurality of Americans knew that unemployment is currently at its lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Similarly, slightly more Americans knew that wages <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-employers-labor-costs-inflation-11643331612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were increasing faster</a> over the last year than they had at any point over the previous two decades — even though a plurality said they didn’t know. That said, there were a couple points where a majority of Americans were wrong. Most notably, 51 percent said that inflation was higher now than at any time since World War II, even though inflation <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=rocU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was actually higher at some points</a> in the 1970s and early 1980s.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans understand inflation but overestimate it" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2pcQa/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="433" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Both younger and older Americans, including those who lived through the high inflation periods of the 1970s and ’80s, were likely to say that inflation was higher now. Some <a href="https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/content/recency-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recency bias</a> is probably at play here, but older Americans may also feel a greater pinch from inflation today than they did in earlier decades because they are more likely now to live on a fixed income from a pension or social security. “Once you fall behind, there's no catching up until they give you an increase the following year,” said Jarvis White, a 65-year old Black man from Florida. In his view, the situation in the 1970s and ’80s, even during the <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/oil-shock-of-1973-74" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1970s oil embargo</a>, “pales in comparison” to today’s circumstances.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, a plurality of respondents said U.S. gas prices rank among the highest in the world — <a href="https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/gasoline_prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they don’t</a>. But it’s easy to understand why many Americans think they do. For starters, compared to food, clothing or electricity, gas prices have seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220511125439/https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest percentage increase</a> over the past year, which a majority of respondents answered correctly in a separate question in our poll. Moreover, a lot of Americans drive and have to visit the pump often, especially <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-04/9-reasons-the-u-s-ended-up-so-much-more-car-dependent-than-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared to other countries</a>, so it’s no wonder many thought gas prices were relatively high by global standards. “I work in sales, so I drive a lot. Gas is killing me right now,” said Jeni Johnson, a 53-year old white woman from Michigan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were some differences in how Americans answered these questions based on party. For instance, a much smaller share of Democrats than Republicans (48 percent vs. 86 percent) correctly said inflation wasn’t higher when Donald Trump was president, and a smaller share of Republicans than Democrats (40 percent vs. 57 percent) correctly said that unemployment is at its lowest point since the start of the pandemic, which reflects <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-pessimistic-views-on-the-economy-have-little-to-do-with-the-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how partisanship can color economic views</a>. But broadly speaking, Americans were on the same page, including in some cases for what they thought was responsible for driving inflation. A sizable majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents said that supply chain breakdowns, the COVID-19 pandemic and foreign conflicts had all had a “major” or “significant” impact. From there, though, there was much less agreement, as the chart below shows.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Many Americans blame supply chain, COVID-19 for inflation" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hKyZi/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="390" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Most divides fell along somewhat predictable political lines. For instance, Democrats were more likely to blame businesses, with 70 percent saying that businesses trying to make more profits had made a major or significant impact on price increases and 60 percent saying the same of a lack of competition among businesses, compared with only 45 percent and 39 percent of Republicans, respectively. Conversely, Republicans were more likely to blame government COVID-19 spending programs, with two-thirds saying that it was a major or significant reason for inflation, while only 37 percent of Democrats said the same. Of course, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-and-republicans-get-wrong-about-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither side is fully correct in its assessment of what’s causing inflation</a>, but it does underscore once again how partisanship can influence how Americans interpret economic conditions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of partisan differences, though, half of the respondents in the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll named inflation as a top concern — both for them personally and for the country. And there’s good reason to think that this issue could be a major boon to Republicans’ hopes of taking control of the House and Senate. That’s because independents, about half of whom named inflation as a major worry, aren’t happy with the status quo — only 30 percent had a favorable view of Biden in the poll, compared with 55 percent who had an unfavorable opinion of the president. Independents <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/15/facts-about-us-political-independents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are less likely to vote</a> than Republicans or Democrats, and our survey suggests that about half of all likely voters who are independent haven’t yet decided which major party they’ll support or have decided they will not support either in November. Yet given Biden’s poor numbers among independents and that inflation looks like a long-term problem, Republicans appear to have an easy way to appeal to dissatisfied, less partisan voters who will be more open to a message of change come November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, inflation could very well be the issue that tips the scales this year sharply to the Republicans’ advantage.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Most of the primary action so far this year has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/16-gop-primaries-to-watch-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania-idaho-and-oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Republican side</a>, but Tuesday’s elections in Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idaho is also holding its primary, but there are no Democratic primaries of note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> will also decide the future of the Democratic Party in those states. The party’s progressive wing, which has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting more judicious</a> about picking its battles, has a few golden opportunities to gain new members of Congress. There are also several races where Democrats could add to the diversity of their caucus by nominating a woman, a person of color or both. We’ll even get our first big test this year of how much influence the cryptocurrency industry and pro-Israel groups have in the Democratic Party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here’s everything you need to know about the 12 Democratic primaries we’re following today. And don’t forget to join us tonight at 6 p.m. Eastern for our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a> of the results.</p>



<h2><strong>Kentucky</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 3rd Congressional District<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 6 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth announced he was retiring from Kentucky’s solidly blue <strong>3rd Congressional District</strong>, it had the potential to set off a scramble to replace him. But instead, Louisville politicos mostly <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/07/rep-john-yarmuth-endorses-morgan-mcgarvey-race-succeed-him/6669338001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coalesced around</a> state Senate Minority Leader Morgan McGarvey. McGarvey has raised by far the most money in the field (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2KY03206/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1.5 million</a>) and has also benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=KY03&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $1 million</a> in outside spending from Protect Our Future PAC, which is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/19/crypto-super-pac-campaign-finance-00026146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely funded</a> by 30-year-old billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, who founded the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. (This isn’t the last time Protect Our Future will appear in this primary preview.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While McGarvey is <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/03/morgan-mcgarvey-attica-scott-legalized-marijuana-defund-police/7411277001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberal on most issues</a> (he supports single-payer health care and the Green New Deal), he is still facing a challenge on his left from state Rep. Attica Scott, who entered the race before Yarmuth announced his retirement. Scott, who would be Kentucky’s first Black member of Congress, supports defunding the police and canceling all student-loan debt, which McGarvey opposes. However, she has raised only <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2KY03172/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$236,476</a>, and perhaps in an acknowledgment of her long odds, only two major progressive organizations (the <a href="https://www.boldprogressives.org/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progressive Change Campaign Committee</a> and <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>) have endorsed her.</p>



<h2><strong>North Carolina</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 1st, 4th and 13th congressional districts<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7:30 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Outside spending is also frustrating progressive bids in a couple North Carolina House primaries. In the state’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong>, Rep. G.K. Butterfield is retiring and has <a href="https://www.wral.com/butterfield-backs-moderate-democrat-davis-in-race-for-northeastern-nc-congressional-district/20251525/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> state Sen. Don Davis to succeed him, arguing that the moderate Davis would be Democrats’ strongest general-election candidate in a seat that will likely be competitive in 2022. (It has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> of just D+5.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, progressive figures like the PCCC and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are backing former state Sen. Erica Smith, who has tried to make the race about Davis’s <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article261058357.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotty support for abortion rights</a> in the wake of the Supreme Court’s leaked draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Smith has outraised Davis <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NC02238/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$831,937</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NC02287/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$612,266</a>, but Davis has benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NC01&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $2.3 million</a> in outside spending from the <a href="https://businessnc.com/new-aipac-money-boosting-don-davis-valerie-foushee-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Democracy Project</a>, a pro-Israel super PAC funded by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The primary still looks competitive, though: Despite the Davis campaign recently releasing a <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1524783941823111171?s=20&amp;t=WN9TJJXH0Lo6saTV1Val3w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> giving himself a 13-point lead, that isn’t very convincing since internal polls often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overstate their sponsors’ positions</a> by several percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Bankman-Fried (the cryptocurrency magnate) and AIPAC are also <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article260975442.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pouring money</a> into the Democratic primary to replace retiring Rep. David Price in North Carolina’s safely blue <strong>4th District</strong>, around Durham. Protect Our Future has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NC04&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> and the United Democracy Project nearly $2.1 million to help state Sen. Valerie Foushee defeat Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam and singer Clay Aiken. (Yes, <a href="https://americanidol.fandom.com/wiki/Clay_Aiken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that Clay Aiken</a>.) AIPAC has probably gotten involved here due to Allam’s history of <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2021/11/a-north-carolina-congressional-candidate-has-a-long-history-of-anti-israel-activism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Israel activism</a>, but its investment has <a href="https://indyweek.com/news/elections/nc-4th-congressional-district-democratic-primary-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rubbed some voters the wrong way</a> given that it also supports Republicans and Allam is Muslim. (Her religion has also made her the target of <a href="https://www.wral.com/singer-state-senator-activist-highlight-congressional-race-in-durham-chapel-hill/20268712/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islamophobic push polls</a> and death threats.) The Progressive Caucus of the North Carolina Democratic Party even <a href="https://www.pcncdp.org/press" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revoked its endorsement</a> of Foushee for accepting AIPAC’s money. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The three candidates have all embraced progressive policy platforms, but it’s Allam who has gained endorsements from the movement’s big names: <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article260858882.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a>, <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/05/10/ocasio-cortez-endorses-strong-progressives-allam-and-lee-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> and the <a href="https://www.peoplesalliancepac.org/people_s_alliance_pac_endorses_candidates_running_in_2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People’s Alliance</a>, a local progressive group. Foushee’s backers include the <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article260319695.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People</a> and <a href="https://www.emilyslist.org/candidates/valerie-foushee-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMILY’s List</a>, which are closer to the Democratic Party establishment but also reflect her identity as a Black woman. EMILY’s List also commissioned the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17mBEV112uPiqfm0F2ed2F_ltSnV_xWXO/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only poll</a> we’ve seen of the race, which put Foushee at 35 percent, Allam at 16 percent and Aiken at 10 percent. (Remember, though, EMILY’s List is not a neutral observer here.) If no candidate receives more than 30 percent of the vote, the race will go to a runoff on July 26.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Democratic primary is a little more low-key in the <strong>13th District</strong>, an open seat in the Raleigh suburbs. The front-runner seems to be state Sen. Wiley Nickel, who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NC14019/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.4 million</a> ($900,000 of it from his own pocket). However, former state Sen. Sam Searcy, a moderate with a <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/opinion/wake-democrats-are-key-in-13th-district-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputation for bipartisan dealmaking</a> in the legislature, could be Democrats’ best bet to win here in November. With a partisan lean of R+3, this seat could be an uphill climb for Democrats in a Republican-leaning midterm.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the Democratic primary for North Carolina’s <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> seat isn’t expected to be competitive, but it’s worth a brief mention considering that Democrats are hoping to make a run at this seat in the fall. Their nominee will almost certainly be former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who overwhelmingly leads her 10 opponents in <a href="https://www.meredith.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spring2022PollReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary polling</a> and would be the first Black female senator since Kamala Harris if she wins.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A distinction that other women, such as Pennsylvania’s Kathy Barnette or Florida’s Val Demings, could also share.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, 12th and 17th congressional districts<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Republican primary for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> in Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/kathy-barnette-oz-mccormick-attack-pa-senate-20220512.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devolves into chaos</a>, the Democratic one is likely to be a coronation. Despite recent news that he had <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-05-15/fetterman-treated-at-lancaster-hospital-after-suffering-stroke-during-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a stroke</a>, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is the clear front-runner, thanks to being an <a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/personality/2021/06/how-john-fetterman-redefined-role-lieutenant-governor/364575/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely active lieutenant governor</a> and raising more money than any other candidate (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S6PA00274/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16.0 million</a>). According to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOQISg8HPNhtCK72dKVoGbHB3oMeoRRs/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> from Franklin &amp; Marshall College, Fetterman leads his closest competitor by 39 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not to say that other candidates haven’t tried to take him down. Centrist Rep. Conor Lamb is running on the argument that he is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/us/politics/conor-lamb-pennsylvania-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more electable</a>, but voters don’t seem to be buying it; Fetterman’s tough, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/john-fetterman-pa-senate-race-endorsements-20220511.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsider</a> image (literally — he is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/04/16/john-fetterman-profile-2022-senate-politics-pennsylvania-481259" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6′ 8″, is heavily tattooed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnFetterman/status/1487142012881186818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1487142012881186818%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbiden-democrats-scheduling-conflict-2022-midterms-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wore basketball shorts</a> to meet President Biden) seems tailor-made to win back the white, working-class voters who have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-pennsylvania-could-decide-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made Pennsylvania a slightly Republican-leaning state</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta has been running as the most progressive candidate in the race, but Fetterman has no shortage of progressive cred either, as he was one of Sanders’s <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/04/john-fettermans-senate-campaign-needs-bernie-sanders-help.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earliest supporters</a>. Kenyatta, who would be both <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/malcolm-kenyatta-senate-2022-pennsylvania-primary-election-20220503.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s first Black and first openly gay senator</a>, has also <a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/kenyatta-criticizes-fetterman-over-black-jogger-incident-in-virtual-senate-forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized Fetterman</a> over a 2013 incident in which he <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/who-is-john-fetterman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chased a Black jogger while armed with a shotgun</a>. <a href="https://johnfetterman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GBAO-JF-memo-041122-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls show</a> that Fetterman does, indeed, <a href="https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/717159/in-pennsylvania-black-voters-concerns-go-beyond-fetterman-gun-incident/?unlock=57OAFJZ96TX32RNU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggle with Black voters</a>, but he still has a wide lead among white Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Progressives’ biggest test in Pennsylvania will likely be the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh’s <strong>12th Congre</strong><strong>ssional District</strong>, a safely Democratic open seat. Virtually every progressive influencer under the sun — <a href="https://justicedemocrats.com/candidate/summer-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Democrats</a>, <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>, the <a href="https://www.boldprogressives.org/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCCC</a>, <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-03-17/bernie-sanders-backs-summer-lee-in-12th-congressional-district-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanders</a>, <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/05/10/ocasio-cortez-endorses-strong-progressives-allam-and-lee-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ocasio-Cortez</a>, <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/endorsements?page=0&amp;q=summer%20lee#summer-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warren</a> — has lined up behind state Rep. Summer Lee. And as of a couple months ago at least, Lee looked like the front-runner: She led attorney Steve Irwin 38 percent to 13 percent in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-1eae-dc88-a7be-1efe8fe10000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March poll</a> sponsored by EMILY’s List (which also <a href="https://emilyslist.org/candidates/summer-lee-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports Lee</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But AIPAC is trying to stop progressives here, too: The United Democracy Project has dropped <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=PA12&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.4 million</a> to help Irwin, who has also outraised Lee <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA18218/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA18200/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$707,344</a>. (A third candidate, law professor Jerry Dickinson, has also raised a respectable <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0PA18097/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$685,185</a>.) Irwin also has the support of Rep. Mike Doyle, the district’s current congressman, and Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, who has argued that Lee (who is Black) would <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/05/12/the-war-in-the-12th-district-bernie-sanders-summer-lee-democratic-party-pittsburgh/stories/202205120151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join the “Squad” in obstructing Biden’s agenda</a>. Without any more recent public polls, it’s tough to say if the spending has made an impact, but both sides are treating this like a competitive race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By comparison, the Democratic primary one district over — in the suburban <strong>17th District</strong> — has <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-05-12/democrats-compete-in-overlooked-but-potentially-crucial-17th-congressional-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten little attention</a>. The race, however, is still important because the district (Lamb’s old seat) has a partisan lean of only D+1, meaning it will likely be very competitive in November. Navy veteran and professor Chris Deluzio, who has the endorsement of the <a href="https://www.politicspa.com/allegheny-dems-back-irwin-deluzio-for-house/100610/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allegheny County Democratic Party</a>, has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17103/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$501,839</a>, while Sean Meloy, a political operative who works to elect LGBTQ candidates, has reeled in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17137/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$251,449</a>. Meloy <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/democratic-primary-to-replace-conor-lamb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identifies as a progressive</a> but hasn’t gotten endorsements from any of the usual progressive suspects.</p>



<h2><strong>Oregon</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 4th, 5th and 6th congressional districts; governor<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern in the Mountain time zone part of Malheur County, 11 p.m. Eastern in the rest of the state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you thought outside groups were investing a lot of money in today’s other Democratic primaries, get a load of Oregon’s<strong> 6th Congressional District</strong>, an open, Democratic-leaning seat. Lawyer Carrick Flynn <a href="https://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/elections/oregon-congressional-candidate-has-attracted-6m-from-national-pacs/article_932272ab-31b5-5ea8-84ef-d10433a768cb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t seem like much of a threat</a> when he entered the race against multiple other candidates with more political experience, but then Protect Our Future spent a whopping <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=OR06&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$11.3 million</a> to help elect him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The investment <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/04/25/what-does-a-crypto-tycoon-want-with-oregons-new-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused many people to wonder</a> why a cryptocurrency magnate is so interested in the race; although Flynn’s wife and Bankman-Fried briefly worked for the same organization, Flynn says he and Bankman-Fried have never met. The answer appears to be that Flynn and Bankman-Fried share the same philosophy of “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/12/carrick-flynn-save-world-congress-00031959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective altruism</a>” and both believe in investing against long-term threats like future pandemics. (Protect Our Future’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2022/02/08/big-money-enters-dem-vs-dem-primary-00006746" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated goal</a> is to support candidates with a “long term view on policy planning, especially as it relates to pandemic preparedness and prevention”; Flynn <a href="https://pamplinmedia.com/sg/77-news/534952-428222-vernonia-native-enters-congressional-race-in-sixth-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted research</a> into pandemic prevention at Oxford University in 2015.) However, Protect Our Future’s involvement has also <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/05/04/how-oregons-new-congressional-district-could-become-a-colony-ruled-by-a-distant-crypto-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised questions</a> of Flynn’s independence as Congress <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/04/26/congress-members-cryptocurrency-market-regulation-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considers more regulations</a> on the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just the cryptocurrency industry backing Flynn; the <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/04/11/house-democrats-pac-buys-ads-for-carrick-flynn-in-cd6-irks-other-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic establishment is behind him too</a>. House Majority PAC, a PAC aligned with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that had <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/4/13/2091631/-Morning-Digest-Jeff-Merkley-slams-top-super-PAC-s-spending-in-House-primary-as-flat-out-wrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never taken sides</a> in a Democratic primary before, has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00495028/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$939,477</a> to support Flynn. Other Democratic candidates in the race <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/04/11/national-democrats-choose-favorite-via-pac-oregon-6th-congressional-district-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slammed the move</a>, <a href="https://mailchi.mp/cb4ffcfb1d2d/releasecongresswoman-suzanne-bonamici-endorses-state-representative-andrea-salinas-in-oregons-6th-congressional-district-9007406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointing out</a> that there were multiple better-qualified women of color in the running: state Rep. Teresa Alonso León, state Rep. Andrea Salinas and former Multnomah County Commissioner Loretta Smith. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Salinas appears to be Flynn’s main competition; she sports a couple prominent progressive endorsements (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/11/warren-oregon-primary-00031695" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warren</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/news/campaign/3484941-jayapal-endorses-six-progressive-house-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Pramila Jayapal</a>), and the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has spent nearly <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00365536/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 million</a> on her behalf. But there are nine Democrats on the ballot in all, two of whom have raised more than $1 million (albeit with the help of self-funding): Army veteran Cody Reynolds (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR01216/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.7 million</a>) and Intel engineer Matt West (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR06041/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.0 million</a>). The <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1522256265006796801?s=20&amp;t=_7I3dhomS_pEXbp5e8EooA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one public poll</a> of the primary we’ve seen, from Salinas’s campaign, shows a free-for-all of a race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, the Democratic primary for the <strong>5th District</strong> is a head-to-head race between incumbent Rep. Kurt Schrader and attorney Jamie McLeod-Skinner. According to <a href="https://voteview.com/person/20944/kurt-schrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DW-NOMINATE</a>, a common way of measuring the ideology of members of Congress, Schrader is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, and he has infuriated progressives with his <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/politics/oregon-rep-kurt-schrader-explains-his-vote-against-coronavirus-relief-bill-minimum-wage/283-11d94feb-ec1a-4248-a2ec-4d1949632787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote against</a> Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill and comment that former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment was a “<a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2021/01/rep-kurt-schrader-apologizes-after-likening-trump-impeachment-to-lynching.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lynching</a>.” McLeod-Skinner is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/22/progressives-kurt-schrader-congress-oregon-primary-00019083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging him from the left</a>, hoping to make him the second incumbent to lose renomination this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Progressives like <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1498298641404076037?s=20&amp;t=8xRpsYjtQTIcr6j0vWdGrw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warren</a> and <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a> have endorsed McLeod-Skinner — though interestingly, others (Justice Democrats, Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) have kept their powder dry. However, Schrader boasts the <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/04/23/president-joe-biden-endorses-incumbent-kurt-schrader-for-5th-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support of Biden</a>, who (unlike <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his predecessor</a>) rarely wades into intraparty fights. (This is just the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Endorsements_by_Joe_Biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second Democratic primary</a> in which he has endorsed as president.) Many Democrats fear that nominating McLeod-Skinner would help Republicans flip the seat, which has a partisan lean of just D+3, this fall. However, Schrader may not be a particularly strong candidate himself; he did 1.7 points worse than Biden in his district in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Schrader has a massive financial advantage in the race (he’s spent nearly <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8OR05107/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 million</a>, and pro-Schrader outside groups have added another <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=OR05&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.1 million</a>; meanwhile, McLeod-Skinner having spent just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8OR02161/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$579,044</a>), and he’s <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/politics/elections/results-in-the-oregon-us-house-fifth-district-primary-race/283-2d477a9d-97df-4401-a344-879dcffeb856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned back</a> progressive primary challenges before. However, his district’s boundaries were drastically changed in redistricting; 53 percent of the district is new to him, so his incumbency may not give him a big advantage this time around. We haven’t seen any recent surveys of the race, but <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/2022-primaries/may-massacre-primary-alarm-bells-multiple-house-incumbents?check_logged_in=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private polling</a> reportedly gives McLeod-Skinner the lead. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door in the <strong>4th District</strong>, eight Democrats are competing to succeed retiring Rep. Peter DeFazio. State Labor Commissioner Val Hoyle is the front-runner, having earned <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/04/27/oregon-4th-congressional-district-candidates-primary-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFazio’s endorsement</a> and raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR04095/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$782,440</a>. By contrast, attorney Andrew Kalloch has taken in just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR04103/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$275,014</a>, and environmental activist Doyle Canning has raised just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/OR/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$232,545</a>. Canning has earned the support of <a href="https://www.canningforcongress.com/endorsements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several local progressive groups</a>, but most of the big national players haven’t stuck their necks out for her, perhaps reflecting the size of <a href="http://climatehawksvote.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OR4Results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoyle’s lead</a> (16 points, according to a poll sponsored by a group that supports Canning). With a partisan lean of D+9, this district will probably stay in Democratic hands this fall, but it’s not a sure thing — a fact that DeFazio and Hoyle have used to argue Canning would be a <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-ore-dems-are-turning-their-backs-on-green-candidate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risky nominee</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, Oregon Democrats will also pick their nominee for <strong>governor</strong>. With the retirement of incumbent Gov. Kate Brown, it’s the first open Oregon gubernatorial election since 2010, and an impressive 15 candidates qualified for the Democratic primary. (Not included in that number: former New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who tried to run but was <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/02/nick-kristof-cant-run-for-oregon-governor-supreme-court-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled ineligible</a> because he did not meet the residency requirement.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the race is probably between <a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/28/oregon-tina-kotek-tobias-read-lead-field-of-15-democrats-for-governor-2022-primary-election/65352487007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just two candidates</a>: former state House Speaker Tina Kotek and state Treasurer Tobias Read. Kotek, who would make history as the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-lgbt-politics/oregon-democrat-tina-kotek-vies-to-become-first-openly-lesbian-u-s-governor-idUSL8N2UD3Y7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first openly lesbian governor</a> of any state,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A distinction she may share with Massachusetts’s Maura Healey.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">The winner of the primary will be favored to be the next governor of Oregon, but it’ll probably be a competitive campaign. Oregon is a close enough state that it can be flipped in good election years for Republicans (like 2022 is shaping up to be), and there is also an independent candidate, <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/12/14/oregon-state-senator-betsy-johnson-resigning-governor-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Democratic state Sen. Betsey Johnson</a>, who could siphon off Democratic votes.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday is the busiest election day of the year so far, as five states — Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania — hold their 2022 primaries. And for the GOP, it will be another test of whether to move on from former President Donald Trump. Coming off Nebraska last week — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-candidate-lost-in-nebraska-but-trump-is-still-winning-most-of-his-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his first loss of the year</a> — Trump has endorsed candidates in seven major primaries on Tuesday, which should give us a clearer answer as to his power in the party. And even in races where Trump has no skin in the game, Republicans are considering nominating someone in his incendiary, illiberal mold — which could make it harder for the GOP to pick up seats in November. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, it’s the highest-stakes primary day yet. Here are the 16 (!) Republican primaries to keep an eye on:</p>



<h2><strong>North Carolina</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 1st, 11th and 13th congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7:30 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s first — and easiest — test will come in North Carolina’s <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> race, which is open this year because Sen. Richard Burr is retiring. Former Gov. Pat McCrory started the race <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/carolinajournal.com/app/uploads/2021/04/28093026/NC_US_Senate_GOP_Primary_Survey-NC_US_CJ_Smart_Charts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way ahead in the polls</a>, probably due to name recognition, but last June, Trump <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article251961783.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw his weight behind</a> Rep. Ted Budd, who at the time was polling in the single digits. That gave Budd a boost, but even <a href="https://tedbudd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TB4S-March-Polling-Memo-March-11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Budd’s own polling</a> found he was still trailing McCrory by a few percentage points as recently as the beginning of March. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/09/trump-budd-north-carolina-struggles-senate-primary-00015472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump noticed</a> and even reportedly tried to get a third candidate, Rep. Mark Walker, to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/05/donald-trump-ted-budd-north-carolina-523779" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop out</a> in order to consolidate the Trumpist vote. (Walker has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-donald-trump-north-carolina-senate-elections-greensboro-f589a94f847c321ae07effab69aa092c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stayed put</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Starting in March, though, Budd <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/11/trump-ted-budd-north-carolina-senate-00024322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned on the jets</a>, and the <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/ted-budd-solidifies-frontrunner-status-in-us-senate-gop-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> (conducted May 7-9 by Emerson College) showed him at 43 percent, McCrory at 16 percent and Walker at 12 percent. But the Republican kingmaker most responsible for the surge probably wasn’t Trump, but rather the Club for Growth, an anti-government-spending outside group that has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NCS2&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about $11 million</a> on Budd’s behalf. Many of the group’s <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/5192236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads</a> have also slammed McCrory for being <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/icymi-new-nc-sen-valentines-day-tv-ad-on-mccrorys-love-for-liberals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too liberal</a> (though his governorship was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/12/conservative-governor-north-carolina-rino-pat-mccrory-00031996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anything but</a>) and accepting the results of the 2020 election, explaining why the onetime front-runner has cratered as much as Budd has risen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump and the Club for Growth are also backing the same candidate in the GOP primary for North Carolina’s open <strong>13th District</strong>: 26-year-old former college football player Bo Hines. However, Hines has <a href="https://www.wral.com/hines-faces-gop-pushback-to-congressional-bid-ahead-of-nc-trump-rally/20225052/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced criticism</a> for his weak ties to the district and <a href="https://www.wral.com/triangle-congressional-candidate-bo-hines-moves-to-district-a-month-out-from-election/20258384/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shopping around</a> for a place to launch a long-awaited political career (“[T]he ultimate goal would be president,” <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/college/football/article29408317.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hines said</a> all the way back in 2015). He filed to run in two different districts before choosing this one, about 100 miles east of where he lived at the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Together, the Club for Growth and a super PAC <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/388683-freedom-caucus-bruised-but-unbowed-in-gop-primary-fights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aligned</a> with the ideologically similar House Freedom Caucus have spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NC13&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $2 million</a> to help elect Hines. However, through April 27, attorney Kelly Daughtry had spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NC04200/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $2.7 million</a> of mostly her own money on the race. Former Rep. Renee Ellmers may also have lingering name recognition from representing part of the district from 2011 to 2017, and Army veteran Kent Keirsey, who has the endorsement of potential 2024 presidential candidate and Arkansas Sen. <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article260341675.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Cotton</a>, can’t be counted out either. With eight total candidates in the running, this race may very well go to a runoff, which under North Carolina law will occur on July 26 if no candidate receives more than 30 percent of the vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another race that could go to a runoff is the Republican primary in the <strong>11th District</strong>, where seven Republicans are seeking to deny incumbent Rep. Madison Cawthorn a second term. The youngest person elected to Congress in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54823890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 50 years</a>, Cawthorn quickly became a darling of MAGA conservatives but also a source of controversy, both encouraging people trying to overturn the 2020 election results to “<a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/2021/01/12/cawthorn-told-trump-supporters-lightly-threaten-members-congress/6638181002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lightly threaten</a>” members of Congress and calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “<a href="https://www.wral.com/us-rep-madison-cawthorn-calls-zelensky-thug/20180199/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thug</a>.” And in late March, he bizarrely claimed his fellow GOP lawmakers had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/politics/madison-cawthorn-orgy-invite-cocaine-claim/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invited him to an orgy</a> and done cocaine in front of him — which he later admitted to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy were <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/03/30/cawthorn-mccarthy-orgy-cocaine-exaggerated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exaggerations</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These incidents seem to have earned him the enmity of his fellow Republicans. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis has <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/politics/north-carolina-politics/thom-tillis-endorse-chuck-edwards-madison-cawthorn-north-carolina-house-primary/275-78e75a65-5c5c-42d2-9c31-6449f821e248" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> primary challenger state Sen. Chuck Edwards. It’s also marked the beginning of an epic parade of bad headlines that appear to have been the result of a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-relentless-campaign-to-ruin-madison-cawthorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated opposition-research dump</a> from his opponents, ranging from the embarrassing (images have emerged of him <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/22/madison-cawthorn-photos-00027286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wearing lingerie</a>, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10764209/GOP-Rep-Madison-Cawthorn-caught-video-male-staff-members-hand-crotch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being touched on the crotch by a male staffer</a> and <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/politics/madison-cawthorn-leaked-nude-video-response-blackmail-north-carolina-primary/275-67324779-a94f-4ee7-8a42-aeb409599ecb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simulating a sex act while naked beside a friend</a>) to the illegal (he appears to have engaged in <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/madison-cawthorn-implicated-in-potential-insider-trading-scheme-experts-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insider trading</a> and violated House rules on the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/madison-cawthorn-may-have-a-new-ethics-violation-to-handle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">payment of staffers</a>). This is on top of older scandals like accusations of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/madison-cawthorn-sexual-misconduct-allegations-patrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexually harassing women</a>, <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article260515652.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving with a revoked license</a> and carrying a <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article260774752.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loaded gun into an airport</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The latest controversies have all happened so quickly that it’s hard to know whether they have put Cawthorn in danger of losing renomination (or getting forced into a runoff). We could find only <a href="https://gopacelect.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NC-CD11_GOP-Primary-Topline-4-27-222.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one public poll</a> of the race since the “orgy” comments, and it showed Cawthorn leading Edwards, 38 percent to 21 percent, with the six other candidates combining for 21 percent — hardly an impressive showing for Cawthorn, but good enough for a win. That said, the <a href="https://gopacelect.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NC-New-CD11_GOP-Primary-Topline-3-14-22-0021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same pollster</a> had shown Cawthorn leading Edwards, 49 percent to 14 percent, in mid-March, so the bad press appears to be having <em>some</em> effect — and even the most recent poll was conducted before the release of the sexually explicit videos, so it’s possible he has fallen further since then. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, it’s also possible that the bad headlines <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBj8r1-fDo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crowd each other out</a> or simply become noise: While outside groups have deployed <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NC11&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> against Cawthorn, the incumbent has spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NC11233/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $3.6 million</a>. And although Trump has reportedly been “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/madison-cawthorn-videos-trump-maga-endorsement-1350478/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weirded out</a>” by Cawthorn’s actions, Cawthorn still has the considerable asset that is the former president’s <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/2021/03/31/cawthorn-gets-maskless-trump-endorsement-florida-mar-lago-face-outbreaks/7054046002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cawthorn isn’t the only North Carolina Republican congressional candidate facing a barrage of scandals, though. The GOP primary for North Carolina’s open <strong>1st District</strong> was fairly quiet until Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson’s campaign recently dropped a <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/sandy-vs-sandy-gop-primary-in-nc1-heats-up-with-bankruptcy-abuse-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trove of opposition research</a> against his best-funded opponent, 2020 nominee Sandy Smith. The documents allege that Smith abused her ex-husbands, ran financial scams, changed her identity and more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roberson has argued that the scandals make Smith unelectable in November, and he may have a point: With a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> of D+5, the district is winnable for Republicans, but a scandal-plagued or extreme Republican candidate could ensure it stays in Democratic hands. And Smith is both: In addition to the claims in the opposition research, she also <a href="https://twitter.com/SandySmithNC/status/1347016673115709440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended Trump’s Jan. 6 rally</a> and believes the 2020 election was stolen. Perhaps in reaction, the Congressional Leadership Fund — a super PAC close to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — is spending $584,000 on a <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1524483788046229508" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV ad</a> attacking Smith. With no public polls of the primary, though, either candidate could still win.</p>



<h2><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 7th, 8th and 17th congressional districts; governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pennsylvania’s Republican primary for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> started off with an embarrassment for Trump; will it end that way too? With the <a href="https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/swingcounty/2020/10/pa-sen-pat-toomey-to-retire-at-end-of-term-in-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retirement</a> of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/pat-toomey-trump-impeachment-trial-vote-20210213.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to convict Trump</a> for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, the former president doubtlessly saw an opportunity to replace Toomey with a loyalist, and this past September, he <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/trump-endorses-sean-parnell-pennsylvania-senate-race-20210901.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> Army veteran Sean Parnell, his close ally. However, in November, Parnell’s estranged wife <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/sean-parnell-wife-abuse-choke-senate-hearing-20211101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified</a> that Parnell had choked her and hit their children, and he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2021/11/22/Judge-rules-that-estranged-wife-of-Sean-Parnell-gets-sole-legal-custody-of-couple-s-children-Senate-Republican/stories/202111220099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out of the race</a> shortly thereafter, leaving behind a fractured Republican field.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Celebrity physician Mehmet Oz emerged as the next <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/TRF-PA-22-GOP-Sen-Primary-0209-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">front-runner</a>, thanks in part to his <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/oz-mccormick-sands-tv-spending-pa-senate-2022-20220114.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big ad buys</a>. Trump has also <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2022/04/09/donald-trump-endorses-mehmet-oz-pennsylvania-senate-primary-race/stories/202204090053" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a>, but interestingly, that hasn’t sewn up the race. Oz has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/25/dr-oz-senate-race-stumbles-00002056" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had trouble</a> persuading Pennsylvania Republicans that he is truly one of them. According to a <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/PA-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-May-3-7_release-May-10-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 3-7 poll</a> from Fox News, 46 percent of the state’s Republican primary voters viewed him unfavorably, compared with just 45 percent who viewed him favorably.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could be partially because Oz has previously spoken out against abortion restrictions, called for stricter gun control laws and encouraged masking to stop the spread of COVID-19 (though he now <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-conservative-policy-pa-senate-race-20220419.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embraces more conservative positions</a>). A <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/does-dr-oz-live-in-pennsylvania-20211202.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longtime resident of New Jersey</a>, he also moved to Pennsylvania only in late 2020. Oz, who would be <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/mehmet-oz-pennsylvania-senate-race-republican-turkey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Muslim U.S. senator</a>, has also had his loyalty to the U.S. questioned because of his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/10/senate-republicans-mehmet-oz-dual-citizenship-00031541" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dual U.S.-Turkey citizenship</a> (he says he would <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-dual-turkish-citizenship-pa-senate-race-20220316.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renounce his Turkish citizenship</a> if he were to win).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another reason Oz has struggled? Honor Pennsylvania — a super PAC set up to support his main opponent, former hedge fund manager David McCormick. Honor Pennsylvania has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00798116/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $15 million</a> attacking Oz for, among other things, being a “<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/ads-attacking-dr-oz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollywood liberal</a>.” Ironically, though, McCormick <em>also</em> has a weak claim on being a Pennsylvania Republican. Although he <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/david-mccormick-running-for-pa-senate-2022-20220113.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grew up in the commonwealth</a>, he lived in Connecticut until last year. He also <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/dr-ozs-anti-woke-gop-rival-david-mccormick-has-a-trans-positive-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener">championed social-justice initiatives</a> at his hedge fund, has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/vote-veteran-to-get-the-job-done/2018/05/23/3ae4c9fc-5ea9-11e8-b2b8-08a538d9dbd6_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported Democrats in the past</a> and called the Jan. 6 riot “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/us/politics/david-mccormick-maga-gop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dark chapter in American history</a>.” However, he has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-04-06/mccormick-vs-dr-oz-ex-bridgewater-ceo-gets-trumpy-in-pa-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinvented himself during the campaign</a> as a faithful follower of Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For months, the race seemed like it was between Oz and McCormick. Through April 27, their <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00638/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigns</a> had each spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00661/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$14 million</a> (most of it from each candidate’s personal wealth) — and that doesn’t even include outside spending like Honor Pennsylvania’s. But as they went nuclear on each other, a third candidate has <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/kathy-barnette-momentum-pa-senate-2022-20220511.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught fire in the race</a>: author Kathy Barnette. Although she has raised just a fraction of their cash (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00489/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than $1.8 million</a>), Barnette has turned heads with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/us/politics/pennsylvania-gop-races.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong debate performances</a> and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=z6xtY5AnJk8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspiring life story</a>. In particular, Barnette’s statement that she is the “<a href="https://nypost.com/2022/05/05/gop-senate-hopeful-kathy-barnette-reveals-she-is-a-product-of-rape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">byproduct of a rape</a>” has <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/05/gop-senate-candidate-kathy-barnette-im-the-product-of-rape-but-was-never-just-a-clump-of-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained traction</a> in <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/05/05/kathy-barnette-slams-dr-oz-on-abortion-i-am-the-byproduct-of-rape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative media</a> as the Supreme Court has brought abortion to the forefront.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TRF-PA-GOP-Sen-Primary-0508-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 6-8 poll</a> from the Trafalgar Group essentially showed a three-way tie, with Oz at 25 percent, Barnette at 23 percent and McCormick at 22 percent. It’s possible, too, that Barnette, who would be the first Black Republican woman to serve in the Senate, could still be on the rise: She gained a powerful ally last week when the Club for Growth announced it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/us/politics/kathy-barnette-pennsylvania-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend $2 million on TV ads</a> for her — more than her campaign has spent all year. But her surge has <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/kathy-barnette-oz-mccormick-attack-pa-senate-20220512.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alarmed other, more establishment-minded Republicans</a>, who worry that nominating Barnette would make it more likely that Democrats flip the seat in November. Barnette has made <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/politics/kfile-kathy-barnette-bigoted-statements/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hateful comments</a> about <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1524140417209483266?s=20&amp;t=ml3ZztFuSfMEB7S_8F2ydg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islam</a> and <a href="https://canadafreepress.com/article/can-christianity-and-the-homosexual-agenda-co-exist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homosexuality</a>, and she <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/a/pennsylvania-voter-fraud-audit-kathy-barnette-20210726.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell deep down the election-fraud rabbit hole</a> after the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans face a similar danger in the <strong>governor</strong>’s race, where state Sen. Doug Mastriano is a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-governor-race-polls-mastriano-barletta-mcswain-white-20220510.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slight front-runner</a> over a weak nine-candidate field. (In the Trafalgar poll, Mastriano had 28 percent support, 10 points ahead of his closest rival.) Like Barnette (with whom he sometimes campaigns), Mastriano is on the far-right fringe of the GOP: He has embraced <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/doug-mastriano-governor-christian-nationalism-qanon-20220504.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian nationalism</a> — the belief that the U.S. was <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/a-pennsylvania-lawmaker-and-the-resurgence-of-christian-nationalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded as a Christian nation that is now under attack</a> — and shared <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/qanon-conspiracy-theory/pa-state-sen-doug-mastriano-promoted-qanon-twitter-over-50-times" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAnon conspiracy theories</a> on social media. He has also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/14/politics/trump-pennsylvania-mastriano-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped lead the charge</a> to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Pennsylvania and was <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-video-appears-to-show-state-sen-mastriano-closer-to-capitol-riot-than-he-said/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">present on the Capitol lawn on Jan. 6</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Mastriano wins the primary and then the general election, it could have a profound effect on U.S. democracy. In Pennsylvania, the governor appoints the secretary of state, who administers elections in the state, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/12/an-openly-pro-coup-trumpist-could-become-pennsylvanias-next-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs off on the certification of the state’s electors</a>. Given that Mastriano has previously <a href="https://twitter.com/senmastriano/status/1332666825490968578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> the state legislature appointing electors in defiance of the state popular vote, a Gov. Mastriano could very well lead to the overturning of a free and fair election in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These extreme positions <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/doug-mastriano-pennsylvania-republican-goverrnor-race-20220429.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have GOP officials terrified</a> that Mastriano would lose this November to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the presumptive Democratic nominee. (For his part, Shapiro has actually <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/josh-shapiro-tv-ad-doug-mastriano-20220505.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired ads</a> that could <em>help</em> Mastriano win the GOP nomination, probably for this very reason.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Representatives from the other Republican campaigns have reportedly <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-republican-governor-doug-mastriano-election-20220510.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed a coordinated effort</a> against Mastriano, but the problem is agreeing on who is the best candidate to stop him. <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/lou-barletta-republican-primary-pennsylvania-governor-fundraising-20220208.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Former Rep. Lou Barletta</a> is second in many polls, but he shares some of Mastriano’s baggage (he was one of Pennsylvania’s “<a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/trumps-fake-electors-heres-the-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake electors</a>,” 20 people who signed fake documents saying Trump had won the state and sent them to the National Archives). <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/bill-mcswain-us-attorney-2022-pa-governor-race-20220316.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Former U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain</a> is the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pennsylvania-primary-election-2022-governors-race-campaign-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best-funded</a>, but Trump has explicitly <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/04/12/donald-trump-bill-mcswain-for-governor-2022-pennsylvania-endorsement-attack-statement/stories/202204120096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-endorsed him</a> for not doing enough to overturn the election. And <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-white-republican-primary-governor-2022-delaware-county-20220427.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Delaware County Councilman Dave White</a> looks like a viable contender in <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TRF-PA-GOP-Gov-Primary-0508-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some polls</a> but <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOQISg8HPNhtCK72dKVoGbHB3oMeoRRs/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not in others</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two candidates, state Senate President Jake Corman and former Rep. Melissa Hart, did <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/corman-ends-gop-governor-bid-endorses-barletta-in-effort-to-halt-mastriano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop out</a> and <a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/melissa-hart-lou-barletta-pennsylvania-governor-campaign/39991566#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorse Barletta</a>, but they were each polling in the single digits, so their support is unlikely to make much of a dent in Mastriano’s lead. The only thing that probably could have meaningfully shifted the race would have been if Trump endorsed one of the Mastriano alternatives. But on Saturday, as he often does, he went his own way: He <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/05/trump-weighs-in-on-pas-governors-race-and-make-his-pick-known.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Mastriano</a>, specifically citing how he “revealed the Deceit, Corruption, and outright Theft of the 2020 Presidential Election, and will do something about it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pennsylvania Republicans will also choose their nominees for three congressional districts they hope to flip from blue to red this November. In the <strong>7th District</strong>, former Lehigh County Commissioner Lisa Scheller came within 4 points of beating Democratic Rep. Susan Wild in 2020, and the seat got redder in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a> (it now has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+4). So Scheller is back this year with the <a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/elections/mc-nws-lisa-scheller-congress-pennsylvania-campaign-20220506-vgcittojtjhvnpv75pbsgmejni-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support of House Republican leadership</a>, but she’ll first have to get through business owner Kevin Dellicker in the primary. Scheller appears in good shape, though, having outraised Dellicker <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0PA07132/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.0 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA07096/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$183,321</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Northeastern Pennsylvania’s <strong>8th District</strong> (an<strong> </strong>R+8 partisan lean), Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright’s 2020 opponent, former Trump administration official Jim Bognet (who also lost by about 4 points), is back for a rematch as well. But Bognet lost in 2020, despite that Trump <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/trump-district-democrats-could-become-extinct-in-the-house-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried the district</a>, which is probably due mostly to Cartwright’s strength but also suggests the GOP could use a better candidate. Former Hazleton Mayor Mike Marsicano is also running in the primary, and Bognet has only outraised him <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0PA08221/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$719,516</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6PA11073/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$525,100</a>. However, Bognet’s support for Trump’s lawsuits over the 2020 election could save his bacon; he recently secured <a href="https://www.poconorecord.com/story/news/politics/elections/local/2022/05/05/trump-backs-bognet-in-northeast-pennsylvania-congressional-primary/65353737007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the <strong>17th District</strong> has a partisan lean of D+1, but the retirement of Rep. Conor Lamb has given the GOP an opening in this suburban Pittsburgh seat. Former Ross Township Commissioner Jeremy Shaffer <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-05-05/abortion-debate-animates-race-between-gop-congressional-candidates-in-17th-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks like the front-runner</a>, having raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17160/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$729,063</a>, and he is also likely the candidate with the most general-election appeal (he says he probably would have voted for President Biden’s infrastructure bill). National security consultant Jason Killmeyer has positioned himself as the more conservative option, but he has raised only <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17152/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$135,220</a>. A third candidate, former Bellevue Councilwoman Kathleen Coder, has raised just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17186/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9,775</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Idaho</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 2nd Congressional District, governor, attorney general, secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, 11 p.m. Eastern in the Panhandle</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Idaho, governors and lieutenant governors don’t run on the same ticket, which has led to the <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/05/09/2022-idaho-primary-election-republican-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unusual situation</a> of Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin running for <strong>governor</strong> against her boss, incumbent Gov. Brad Little. Little has impeccable pro-Trump credentials (he <a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2020/12/11/gov-little-joins-with-idaho-gop-in-supporting-texas-lawsuit-on-election-integrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported Texas’s lawsuit</a> to invalidate the 2020 election results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), but the former president is nevertheless <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/trump-endorses-mcgeachin/277-b6db1f08-a46f-4977-ba0a-ab60478336b6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting McGeachin</a>, who is even further to the right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McGeachin supports a <a href="https://idahonews.com/news/local/idaho-lt-gov-mcgeachin-wants-50-state-election-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50-state audit</a> of the 2020 election and has <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/03/02/mcgeachin-asked-a-boise-rabbi-to-join-an-antisemitism-task-force-the-same-day-she-spoke-at-afpac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered a recorded message to a conference</a> hosted by white nationalists. She is probably most famous, though, for her vehement opposition to mask and vaccine mandates: Twice, while serving as acting governor when Little was traveling out of state, she has issued <a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/news/2021-05-27/mcgeachin-signs-executive-order-banning-mask-mandates-with-little-out-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive orders</a> <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/idaho-lt-gov-janice-mcgeachin-vaccine-passport-order-covid-19/277-38c2fcb5-814b-4d33-ac7a-d9c6575cfe64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning such mandates</a>, only to see Little <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/capitol-watch/idaho-mask-mandate-ban-executive-order-repealed-governor-brad-little-abuse-of-power/277-20e89731-2e23-4984-9db3-41331403c881" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quickly</a> <a href="https://www.kivitv.com/news/political/inside-the-statehouse/idaho-governor-repeals-political-rivals-executive-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rescind</a> them, calling McGeachin’s behavior “an irresponsible, self-serving political stunt.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if one of Trump’s other endorsees hasn’t already lost by this point in the evening, Idaho will probably snap his winning streak. According to a <a href="https://idahodispatch.com/2022poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted last month</a> by Zoldak Research for the Idaho Dispatch, Little led McGeachin by a whopping 60 percent to 29 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few other, more moderate Republican incumbents are also facing renomination threats from anti-democratic challengers. In Idaho’s <strong>2nd District</strong>, Rep. Mike Simpson is facing a rematch from lawyer Bryan Smith, whom he beat in 2014, 62 percent to 38 percent. While Simpson voted to certify the 2020 election results, Smith believes it was fraudulent. Outside groups have spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=ID02&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1.3 million</a> on Simpson’s behalf, which should help shore up his position but also suggests they see Smith as a serious threat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lawrence Wasden, the longest-serving <strong>attorney general</strong> in Idaho history, is also in danger of losing his bid for a sixth term to former <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/15/raul-labrador-profile-tea-party-congress-2018-218822/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tea-party</a> Republican Rep.

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, with the retirement of <a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2021/09/29/idaho-secretary-state-refutes-mike-lindells-statewide-manipulation-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-democracy</a> incumbent Lawerence Denney, there’s a very real possibility that an election denier will become Idaho’s next <strong>secretary of state</strong>. Two of the three candidates, state Rep. Dorothy Moon and state Sen. Mary Souza, have said that Biden <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/04/26/two-of-three-idaho-gop-secretary-of-state-candidates-deny-biden-won-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not fairly win the 2020 election</a>. However, both have been <a href="https://sunshine.sos.idaho.gov/?offices%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=59&amp;parties%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=Republican&amp;contest_years%5B0%5D=2022&amp;contest_years%5B1%5D=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outraised</a> by Ada County Clerk Phil McGrane, who runs elections in Idaho’s most populous county and has accepted Biden’s win, so it’s possible that a pro-democracy Republican still ends up holding this office.</p>



<h2><strong>Oregon</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 5th and 6th congressional districts, governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern in the Mountain time zone part of Malheur County, 11 p.m. Eastern in the rest of the state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Oregon is a fairly blue state, but two factors could conspire to give Republicans an opening there in November: the Republican-leaning <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national environment</a> and outgoing Democratic Gov. Kate Brown’s <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/05/new-poll-finds-kate-brown-is-nations-least-popular-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopularity</a>. Perhaps sensing an opening, 19 candidates are running in the GOP primary for <strong>governor</strong>, but none has exactly taken the state by storm: According to <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21866126/oregon-gop-primary-topline-survey-results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nelson Research</a>, “undecided” leads with 27 percent, followed by former state House Minority Leader Christine Drazan with 19 percent, former Oregon GOP Chair Bob Tiernan with 14 percent, 2016 GOP gubernatorial nominee Bud Pierce with 10 percent and Sandy Mayor Stan Pulliam with 7 percent. Most of the major candidates are <a href="https://www.pdxmonthly.com/news-and-city-life/2022/04/oregon-governors-race-tv-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional conservatives</a>, but Pulliam has tossed voters <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/05/09/trump-oregon-politics-governors-race-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more pro-Trump red meat</a> (“I’m the only conservative candidate, especially on this stage, that is willing to say the truth,” he said at an April debate: “The 2020 election was fraudulent, completely fraudulent”).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also contested Republican primaries for two congressional seats that the GOP is hoping to flip this year, but perhaps unsurprisingly given both districts’ slightly Democratic lean, these primaries aren’t really shaping up as referendums on Trump, either. For instance, none of the five candidates who responded to a <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/04/leading-oregon-republican-candidates-for-congress-say-biden-was-in-fact-winner-of-2020-presidential-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questionnaire by The Oregonian/OregonLive</a> said that the 2020 election was illegitimate. In the <strong>5th District</strong>, which has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+3, five Republicans are competing to be the nominee. Former Happy Valley Mayor Lori Chavez-DeRemer (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR05209/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$669,145</a>, including almost $300,000 in self-funding) and energy investor Jimmy Crumpacker (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0OR02168/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$541,208</a>) have raised the most money. If elected in November, Chavez-DeRemer would be the first Hispanic person Oregon sends to the U.S. Congress — she has already <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/elise-stefanik-unveils-endorsements-2022-midterm-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned the support</a> of New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is on a mission to get more female Republicans elected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With a partisan lean of D+7, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand-new</a> <strong>6th District</strong> is tougher terrain for the GOP, but Republicans could probably flip it if they nominate the right candidate. Logistics executive Mike Erickson leads the seven-candidate Republican field in fundraising with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR06124/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$722,688</a>, and his ability to self-fund could also come in handy in November. However, energy executive Nathan Sandvig (whose hero is <a href="https://katu.com/news/know-your-candidates/nathan-sandvig-r-running-for-congress-district-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Dwight Eisenhower</a>) and state Rep. Ron Noble (whose state House district voted for Biden), both of whom are <a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/19/oregon-7-candidates-in-6th-congressional-district-republican-primary/65351031007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasizing how centrist they are</a>, could also be formidable nominees. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And that’s just the half of it. We’ll be previewing the Democratic primaries in these states tomorrow morning, just in time for you to read up on everything before our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a> that night.

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">After about a three-year hiatus, FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-every-senator-ranks-according-to-popularity-above-replacement-senator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popularity Above Replacement Senator</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-the-popularity-above-replacement-governor-rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popularity Above Replacement Governor</a> ratings are back! Based on Morning Consult’s approval ratings<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> for every <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/25/joe-manchins-approach-paying-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">senator</a> and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/28/governor-approval-ratings-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor</a> in the country (now updated for the first quarter of 2022), PARS and PARG attempt to measure how much stronger (or weaker) a politician is than a generic (or, to use a term from baseball, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/wins-above-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replacement-level</a>) candidate from their party would be. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea behind these stats is that a 70 percent approval rating for a Democrat in Massachusetts isn’t the same as a 70 percent approval rating for a Democrat in Florida. Because Massachusetts is so blue, that’s no big whoop in the Bay State — but in reddish Florida, it denotes a talented politician with a lot of cross-party appeal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Calculating PARS and PARG is simple: It’s just the difference between each state’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> and the senator or governor’s net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating). Doing this for the Senate, we get the following table of senators with the best and worst statewide brands:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nationally, Sen. Joe Manchin is best known as a thorn in liberals’ side because he has opposed President Biden’s agenda on the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/12/19/joe-manchin-kills-the-build-back-better-act-joe-bidens-ambitious-legislative-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social safety net</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-brace-for-likely-defeat-of-voting-rights-push-due-to-gop-filibuster/2022/01/19/2f9a734c-792d-11ec-bf97-6eac6f77fba2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting rights</a>, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/05/joe-manchin-vote-against-codify-roe-wade-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion</a> and more. But his moderation has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endeared him to voters</a> in his home state of West Virginia: He has a +22 net approval rating in the R+36 state, for a chamber-leading PARS of +58. And he’s not the only Democrat with a lot of cross-party appeal; in fact, the 16 senators with the highest PARS scores all caucus with the Democratic Party. This includes Sens. Jon Tester (+33 PARS) and Sherrod Brown (+20 PARS), who have managed to win multiple elections despite hailing from red states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This also offers a glimmer of hope to Democrats who face the very real prospect of losing control of the Senate in 2022, as this fall’s midterm elections are shaping up well for Republicans. Their four most vulnerable incumbents this fall — Sens. Raphael Warnock, Mark Kelly, Maggie Hassan and Catherine Cortez Masto — all have PARS scores of at least +7, suggesting that they are capable of outperforming the base partisanship of their state. That will be essential in a year when, based solely on partisan lean and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot polling</a>, you’d expect a Republican to win their home states, all else being equal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the flip side, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has one of the worst PARS scores (-18); despite his home state of Wisconsin having an R+4 partisan lean, his net approval rating is -14 percentage points. This <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/19/ron-johnson-reelection-campaign-wisconsin-00026142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopularity</a> could drag him down in November, allowing Democrats to flip a Senate seat that, on paper, should remain Republican in this environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, a senator’s PARS score isn’t everything. Just ask Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who for years has had the worst PARS score in the country (currently -54). Yet, even though his net approval rating has long been underwater, he easily won reelection in 2020 thanks to Kentucky’s overwhelming Republican lean. (That said, he did win by “only” 20 points, several points worse than the state’s partisan lean, suggesting that his unpopularity did have <em>some</em> effect.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Senators like Manchin and McConnell are exceptions, though. The majority of senators have PARS scores in the single digits, indicating that their approval rating is largely determined by the partisanship of their states. This is less true for governors, however. Although partisanship has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-politics-is-presidential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting more important</a> in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gubernatorial races</a>, it is not as dominant of a force in them as it is in federal elections.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correlation between senatorial approval rating and partisan lean is 0.44; the correlation between gubernatorial approval rating and partisan lean is -0.11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, more governors than senators have PARGs at the extreme ends of the spectrum, as you can see in the table below. Also, a mix of both parties dominates the top of the list — not just Democrats. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-popularity-above-replacement-governor-rankings-are-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As they have for years</a>, three northeastern, blue-state Republicans lead the way: Govs. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Phil Scott of Vermont and Larry Hogan of Maryland. Each currently enjoys an extraordinary PARG of +75 or higher. A trio of red-state Democrats — Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Kansas’s Laura Kelly and Louisiana’s John Bel Edwards — all have PARGs between +31 and +51 as well. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similar to a senator’s PARS score, a governor’s PARG score can also help us get a better sense of which governors running for reelection in 2022 are best equipped to swim against the partisan tide of their states. Scott and Kelly<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker, Hogan, Beshear and Edwards aren’t on the ballot this year; Baker and Hogan are retiring, while Kentucky and Louisiana elect their governors in odd years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> seem to be in the best position, especially Scott: Not only does he have more cross-party appeal than Kelly (+77 PARG), but he is also a Republican running in a good Republican year. Kelly, on the other hand, does have a brand distinct from the national Democratic Party, but it’s an open question whether she can get enough Kansas Republicans who approve of her to take the extra step and vote for her as well. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early polling</a> indicates a tight race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Governors running for reelection in swing states also have some very different PARGs that explain why some of them are vulnerable this year, while others probably don’t have anything to worry about. For instance, New Hampshire is an evenly divided state, but Gov. Chris Sununu’s net approval rating is +30, so he is expected to comfortably win reelection. And you might expect Democratic Gov. Jared Polis to be vulnerable in a Republican-leaning midterm in D+6 Colorado, but his net approval rating is 16 points higher than that, giving him a nice cushion in case the national environment puts his state in play.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With a PARG of +13, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak of Nevada also has a distinct personal brand that could help him weather a tough reelection campaign in purple Nevada. But Democratic Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin may be more at the mercy of the national mood. Evers’s PARG is just +1, suggesting perceptions of him are strongly dependent on partisanship. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan is somewhere in the middle, with a PARG of +6. That suggests she has a <em>bit</em> of crossover appeal, but that her fate is still closely tied to partisanship.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Toward the bottom of the list are five governors running for reelection whose approval ratings don’t look as strong as they seem after taking partisan lean into account. That said, they are all in very safe states, so they shouldn’t be in any danger. The governor’s race in Rhode Island could be a sleeper, though, considering Gov. Dan McKee’s mediocre +2 net approval rating, the fact that he is running for the office for the first time (he <a href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/dan-mckee-takes-oath-of-office-to-become-governor-of-rhode-island" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became governor</a> only because he was the lieutenant governor when the old governor resigned), the pro-Republican national mood and Rhode Island’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elasticity</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the two governors with the worst PARGs are Democrats Kate Brown of Oregon (-25) and David Ige of Hawaii (-41). Both have negative net approval ratings despite governing fairly blue states. They might have been in real danger of losing their seats in 2022, but thankfully for Democrats, both are retiring.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A new <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_051122/">Monmouth University poll</a>, conducted May 5-9 after a draft Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v.

This was significantly worse than the court’s ratings in March, when 42 percent approved and 42 percent disapproved. But it is also arguably the continuation of a long-term decline in the court’s popularity; a Monmouth poll from March 2016 gave the court a 49 percent approval and 33 percent disapproval rating.</li><li>With the prospect that abortion could soon be illegal in many states, some people may face difficult decisions about what to do if they have an unwanted pregnancy.

<p data-paragraph="main">Since January 2021, 11 states have enacted laws limiting how teachers can talk about race and racism in schools, and close to 200 bills have been introduced in 40 states. What are these laws actually doing? What is their impact in the classroom and at the ballot box? And why has this issue become such a focus in our politics?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Galen Druke discusses these questions with Theodore R. Johnson, the director of the Fellows Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2016, North Carolina <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtq-rights-fight-reignited-4-years-after-n-c-s-n1250390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed its infamous “bathroom bill”</a>, which prevented transgender people from using public bathrooms that aligned with their gender identity. Today, anti-trans legislation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/23/anti-trans-bills-us-transgender-youth-sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is taking aim at children</a>. Dozens of states have introduced bills limiting transgender students’ participation on school sports teams that match their gender identity. <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/32117426/state-policies-transgender-athlete-participation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thirteen states</a>, all Republican-leaning, have passed such bills in the last two years, turning an issue that affects <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/age-trans-individuals-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 1 percent</a> of the country’s youth into the latest battle in the culture wars.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the current push to restrict trans rights goes beyond athletics — Republicans are also increasingly pushing to restrict trans rights in the classroom.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using data from <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American Civil Liberties Union</a>, <a href="https://freedomforallamericans.org/legislative-tracker/anti-transgender-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom for All Americans</a> and the Human Rights Campaign,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bills were shared with me via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> as well as additional bills found in the course of my research, I identified 40 bills introduced since January 2021 that seek to restrict how gender and gender identity are taught at schools. Bills ranged from requiring parental consent or notification before teaching these subjects to limiting these topics for students in certain grades to outright prohibiting learning about gender identity.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We limited these bills to only those that specifically mentioned gender or gender identity; bills that sought to restrict teaching related to sexuality or sexual orientation were excluded from this tally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> Other bills prevent students from using different names and pronouns without parental consent or remove antidiscrimination guidelines.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, underscoring just how closely this movement is linked to the push around banning critical race theory — an academic <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal framework</a> that asserts that racism is systemic and embedded in many American institutions — in the classroom, 13 of these bills also included language restricting how schools can teach about race and racism. Several bills targeted critical race theory directly, despite the fact that critical race theory is not taught in K-12 schools.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1116" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi.ANTI-TRANS-use.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi.ANTI-TRANS-use.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi.ANTI-TRANS-use.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi.ANTI-TRANS-use.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi.ANTI-TRANS-mob-use.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi.ANTI-TRANS-mob-use.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi.ANTI-TRANS-mob-use.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi.ANTI-TRANS-mob-use.png?w=1240 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Limiting or banning classroom discussions is “going to have just an enormous chilling effect to prohibit teachers from being able to really have any kind of conversation whatsoever … effectively, they’re not going to be able to talk about LGBTQ people at all,” said Cathryn Oakley, the state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Reading the text of these bills is like a Cliffs Notes summary of all the ways in which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-education-became-todays-wedge-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education has become a wedge issue</a>. Of the 13 bills that limit both how gender and gender identity and race and racism are talked about in the classroom, three proposed bills — in <a href="https://legiscan.com/RI/bill/H7539/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhode Island</a>,<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. 7539&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="https://legiscan.com/SC/bill/H4799/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Carolina</a><a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. 4799&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/WV/text/HB4016/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Virginia</a><a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AB 4016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> — explicitly ban schools from teaching The New York Times’s 1619 Project, which has long been <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/lawmakers-push-to-ban-1619-project-from-schools/2021/02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a target of right-wing attacks in schools</a>. There is also an <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/bill/SB1654/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma</a> bill<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SB 1654&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> that proposes to ban books in public school libraries “that make as their primary subject the study of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender issues.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These fights of what can — and can’t — be taught in schools aren’t new. “Schools have been a site of many political battles and many political interventions,” said Adrienne Dixson, a professor of education at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, citing the historical examples of Brown v. Board of Education (a landmark Supreme Court case that banned racial segregation in public schools) and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1980/08/10/the-battle-of-bilingual-education/9a7cc4e1-f779-42d8-ae95-31c1aae23329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal battles over providing bilingual education</a>. And as FiveThirtyEight’s Alex Samuels and Kaleigh Rogers explained last year, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservatives have long used schools as a battleground for culture war issues</a> over everything from evolution to sex education to racial equality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conservatives’ attacks on schools <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/trump-blasts-left-wing-indoctrination-in-history-classes-as-child-abuse/2020/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ratcheted up during the Trump administration</a>. Following the murder of George Floyd and protests for racial justice in the summer of 2020, then-President Donald Trump tried to control how the federal government talked about issues of race, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/9/24/21451220/critical-race-theory-diversity-training-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning federal agencies and contractors</a> from conducting racial sensitivity training in an executive order <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-race-sex-stereotyping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued in September 2020</a>. The federal government <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/could-president-trump-really-penalize-schools-for-teaching-the-1619-project/2020/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t actually dictate what’s taught in public schools, but Trump also threatened</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/06/politics/trump-education-department-1619-project/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pull funding</a> from some schools that used the 1619 Project in its curriculum.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Trump ultimately wasn’t able to ban what was taught in schools, the rhetoric in his executive order was significant in that it helped “legitimize the discontent that his base had, and has probably had for a while as it relates to racial equity,” according to Dixson. Moreover, the language in his <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/28/2020-21534/combating-race-and-sex-stereotyping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive order</a> has cropped up repeatedly in the anti-trans bills I’ve studied.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, many of these bills are part of a coordinated legislative effort. Oakley told me that Promise to America’s Children, an anti-LGBTQ coalition, was the source of many of these anti-trans bills. And one of the organizations <a href="https://familypolicyalliance.com/press-releases/introducing-the-promise-to-americas-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behind Promise to America’s Children</a>, the Heritage Foundation, <a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/impact/states-use-heritages-model-legislation-reject-critical-race-theory-classrooms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has created model legislation</a> opposing the “tenets” of critical race theory being taught in K-12 classrooms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As of March 15, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/nearly-240-anti-lgbtq-bills-filed-2022-far-targeting-trans-people-rcna20418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">154 anti-trans bills</a> that limit access to health care, sports, bathrooms and education have been introduced in state legislatures across the country, according to NBC News. This is already more than the 153 such bills introduced in 2021. More broadly, the number of anti-LGBTQ bills has also grown from 41 in 2018 to 238 in just the first few months of 2022. (Some states with Democratic-controlled legislatures are fighting back. Connecticut, for instance, became the first state to respond to this sort of legislative action this week with <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2022/TOB/H/PDF/2022HB-05506-R00-HB.PDF#page=270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bill containing a pro-trans provision</a>, proposing a “safe-state law” that would guarantee protections for transgender individuals leaving other states.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans are using tools beyond legislation to attack trans rights. In February, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott instructed the state’s Department of Family and Protective Services to <a href="https://abc13.com/gender-affirming-care-texas-transgender-youth-investigate-as-child-abuse-trans-rights-in/11597436/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigate reports of gender-affirming health care</a> for trans children as child abuse — a move that left many parents of trans children in Texas feeling “frantic,” according to Emma, the mother of an eight-year-old trans girl from Austin. (Emma preferred to use a pseudonym out of privacy concerns.) “I go between feeling a rage and just sheer panic,” she said, adding that she knows six families who are leaving the state over this.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Only one of these bills, Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Act,<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, FiveThirtyEight’s parent company, has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/04/01/disney-dont-say-gay-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;opposed this law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-governor-signs-controversial-dont-gay-bill-law/story?id=83719304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been signed into law so far</a>. But even if many of these bills aren’t passed, they can still create an atmosphere that is hostile to trans people. Often, too, it falls to trans kids to fight back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One student who knows this particularly well is 18-year-old Amira Pierotti, a senior at James Madison Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin, who helped rewrite their local health education curricula twice to make it more LGBTQ-inclusive — Pierotti said the original curriculum had “no LGBT+ representation, nothing on safe sex, nothing on consent, very little on sexual assault.” For the last two years, they say they’ve also been involved  in a lawsuit <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/wisconsin-supreme-court-agrees-to-review-suit-against-mmsd-over-transgender-student-preferred-name-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought on by a local conservative advocacy group</a> over whether staff can call students by different names or pronouns, without parental consent. (Several student clubs at local high schools, including one where Pierotti is a member, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/doe-v-madison-metropolitan-school-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intervened as defendants</a> in the lawsuit.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just this lawsuit, either — Pierotti also helped organize against <a href="https://www.wpr.org/republican-bill-would-require-schools-notify-parents-teaching-programs-sexual-orientation-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bill introduced by Wisconsin Republicans last September</a> that would have required schools to give parents notice before providing any instruction related to sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. One of Pierotti’s friends, Cameron Craig, a 16-year-old sophomore, stayed up the night before and skipped school the next day to testify against the bill. Craig told me that they were motivated to do this because it was important to them that legislators understand what their experience of being a trans student was like.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://legiscan.com/WI/bill/AB562/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The bill ultimately failed</a>, but at that point, <a href="https://legiscan.com/WI/bill/AB963/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a similar bill had already passed</a> both chambers of the Wisconsin legislature. <a href="https://www.wpr.org/evers-vetoes-gop-bills-mps-voucher-schools-parental-bill-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">And while that bill was later vetoed</a> by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, when trans rights at school are up for debate, “it’s an invitation toward discrimination,” said Stephen Russell, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the health and well-being of LGBTQ+ adolescents. For some trans kids, the difference between a supportive and an unsupportive school environment can be a matter of life or death. According to my analysis of data from <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2021/?section=AffirmingSpaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a late 2020 poll from the advocacy group The Trevor Project</a>, trans and nonbinary youth who felt that their school was not a gender-affirming space were almost 30 percent more likely to have attempted suicide in the last year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Craig, the loss of school as a potential safe outlet for self-expression especially makes them concerned for friends who are closeted at home because they don’t have a supportive family. “School is their safe space right now, where we can be kind of openly LGBTQ a good amount of the time,” said Craig. “[T]hat being taken away from them would be really, absolutely devastating.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But with the number of anti-trans bills growing, school might not be a safe space for trans kids anytime soon.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Former President Donald Trump’s perfect 2022 endorsement record is no more. After all 36 Senate, House or governor candidates he endorsed in Texas, Indiana and Ohio won their primaries, Trump-supported businessman Charles Herbster lost his bid for Nebraska governor last night.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The winner of the Republican primary was instead University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, who took <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nebraska-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=84596290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33 percent of the vote</a>. Herbster finished second, with 30 percent, followed closely by moderate state Sen. Brett Lindstrom with 26 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race had been seen as a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-west-virginia-and-nebraska-primaries-will-be-the-latest-test-for-trumps-endorsement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proxy war</a> between Trump and the establishment and moderate wings of the GOP. And thanks to Pillen’s win, the next governor of Nebraska will likely<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming he beats Democratic state Sen. Carol Blood in the fall, which he is &lt;a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heavily favored&lt;/a&gt; to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>27</sup></a> be someone with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/02/trump-pete-herbster-charles-ricketts-nebraska-518392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep ties</a> to the state’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/18/nebraska-republican-candidates-trump-482703" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political and economic establishment</a> who has <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/the-top-four-republican-candidates-for-nebraska-governor-agree-biden-is-president/article_be2bfe00-aa33-11ec-aa07-9bac59c6bcf1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepted President Biden’s election</a>, rather than someone who <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/03/24/herbster-goes-off-script-in-gov-debate-lindstrom-stays-on-thibodeau-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believes that China orchestrated the coronavirus pandemic</a> and spent Jan. 6, 2021, <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/02/25/herbster-was-schmoozing-with-trump-team-jan-5-6-as-they-detailed-plans-to-overturn-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the Trump war room</a>. Along with incumbent Secretary of State Bob Evnen’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/10/us/elections/results-nebraska-secretary-of-state.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">win</a>, it now seems that the 2024 presidential election in Nebraska is set to be certified by two men who <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/02/06/nebraska-secretary-of-state-pushes-back-against-claims-that-2020-vote-was-amiss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respect the democratic process</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the same time, this loss isn’t evidence that Trump’s influence with the Republican base is slipping. Herbster was far from a perfect candidate — most notably, eight women accused him of <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/14/gop-state-senator-seven-other-women-say-charles-herbster-groped-them-he-denies-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwanted sexual advances</a>, including groping and forcible kissing. Retiring Gov. Pete Ricketts also <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/trump-endorses-herbster-for-nebraska-governor-ricketts-disagrees/article_72146196-36b2-11ec-b976-f38f813df474.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked Herbster</a> for allegedly moving his agricultural company out of state and supporting higher taxes, and he <a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/ricketts-endorses-regent-jim-pillen-in-governors-race/article_61ec366b-e5cd-5767-aefd-ad6a6995ddbf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw his full weight</a> behind Pillen (a lesson, perhaps, to other GOP elites that they have influence too, when they choose to wield it). Ultimately, Trump’s endorsement wasn’t powerful enough to drag Herbster to victory, but his endorsement remains an asset in any Republican primary. Just ask Rep. Alex Mooney, who decisively won his primary last night in West Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elimination of one of West Virginia’s House seats</a> after the 2020 census <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw Mooney into the same district</a> as fellow Republican Rep. David McKinley, and Mooney represented only <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-6-house-races-where-incumbents-are-likely-to-face-another-incumbent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">34 percent of the new district</a>, to McKinley’s 66 percent. But with Trump’s endorsement, Mooney romped to a victory, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/west-virginia-2002-primary-election-results/story?id=84596244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent to 36 percent</a>. As a result, there will now be one fewer pro-democracy Republican in the House (McKinley voted to <a href="https://mckinley.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certify the 2020 election</a> and <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/05/19/us-house-approves-jan-6-commission-mckinley-one-of-35-republican-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigate the Jan. 6 attack</a>) and one fewer consensus-builder as well (McKinley was rated as one of the <a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=20abfc4c-e01c-49d2-8a26-5d420d4918fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most bipartisan House members</a> and helped pass <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/11/12/mckinley-mooney-square-off-on-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s infrastructure bill</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, Trump’s endorsed candidates for Senate, House and governor have now won 39 out of their 40 Republican primaries so far in 2022.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Herbster and Mooney, Trump also endorsed West Virginia Rep. Carol Miller and Nebraska Rep. Adrian Smith, who &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/west-virginia-2002-primary-election-results/story?id=84596244" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cruised&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nebraska-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=84596290es.com/interactive/2022/05/10/us/elections/results-nebraska-us-house-district-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;renomination&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>28</sup></a> That statistic, of course, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far overstates his impact</a>: 33 of those 40 endorsements were incumbents facing only token opposition. But that means that, even in relatively uncertain primaries, his picks have still gone 6-for-7. That includes impressive wins by Mooney, who was fighting the geography of his district, as well as author J.D. Vance, who had been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-primary-for-ohio-senate-will-be-a-test-for-trump-but-probably-a-win-for-trumpism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">languishing at around 10 percent in the polls</a> before Trump’s endorsement helped him surge in Ohio’s GOP Senate primary last week.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are still months of primaries yet to be held, so we’ll have to wait and see what Trump’s final track record is before drawing any firm conclusions. But right now, Trump has an impressive 86 percent win rate in incumbent-less primaries. It’s a testament to his <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued popularity within the party</a> — although he clearly isn’t invincible.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/chadwick-matlin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chadwick Matlin</a>, deputy editor)<strong>:</strong> Are we sure that redistricting maps aren’t being drawn by the boy who cried wolf? Following the news around gerrymandering over the past few months has felt like one bait and switch after the other. First you hear about a new map in Alabama, then you hear <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/01/25/federal-court-throws-out-alabamas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a federal court has struck it down</a> for violating racial gerrymandering laws … and then the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/07/1078292766/supreme-court-lets-alabama-use-gop-backed-map-of-the-states-congressional-distri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lets it stand</a>. Next you hear that New York has achieved the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorks-proposed-congressional-map-is-heavily-biased-toward-democrats-will-it-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platonic ideal of a partisan gerrymander</a> … and then weeks later the map <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is struck down by the state’s highest court</a>. And after that … well, it’s easy to lose track of where all these maps stand, and what all these legal interjections mean for the future of <s>gerrymandering</s> redistricting going forward.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To discuss this herky-jerk form of democracy we’re all living through, I’ve asked two colleagues who obsess about this stuff the most to join the chat. Nathaniel Rakich is a senior elections analyst who also administers our invaluable redistricting database. And senior writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux namedrops judicial precedents like they’re part of the vernacular.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nathaniel, Amelia, thanks for taking the time to reflect on this very odd redistricting season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst)<strong>:</strong> Thanks, Chad, for that ebullient introduction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/amelia-thomson-deveaux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</a>, senior writer)<strong>:</strong> I’m here, I have tea, I have chocolate. Let’s doooo ittttt.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> True blogger fuel, Amelia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before we get to the full compendium of lawsuits that I know Nathaniel has been hoarding, let’s start with your overall takeaways. Has this redistricting season gone as you expected it might? Have judges been more or less present in the way our political maps get made than you thought they’d be?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> It depends on when you measure from, Chad — which gets at how the courts have really upended redistricting this cycle. At the beginning of the cycle, I expected the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/redistricting-has-maintained-the-status-quo-so-far-thats-good-for-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning status quo</a> to largely prevail, based on the fact that Republicans were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-won-almost-every-election-where-redistricting-was-at-stake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in charge of drawing more districts</a> than Democrats were. But a couple months ago, I had to revise my expectations to say that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats would actually emerge as winners</a>, because courts had struck down Republican gerrymanders in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and Democrats were drawing their own gerrymanders with impunity. But then courts struck down two of those gerrymanders in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>, which made redistricting look like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more of a partisan wash</a>, so things are now turning out more like I expected at the beginning after all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Redistricting is a flat circle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Or some sort of polygon, anyway.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Is a circle a polygon?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> No! Polygons must have straight sides.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Do political districts have to be polygons??</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Haha, no, I guess not! Some follow river boundaries, for instance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>It’s interesting, because I think state courts were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-fight-over-partisan-gerrymandering-is-moving-beyond-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seen as a bigger threat to Republicans</a> — and yet as Nathaniel pointed out, they’ve turned out to be a hurdle for Democrats as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick: </strong>Nathaniel, can you remind us of just how many states’ maps ended up in court (or are still there)?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Almost every map that could reasonably be considered a gerrymander — and even <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/idaho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some that couldn’t</a> — has been sued over. By my count, 21 states’ congressional maps have been challenged in court. Six (in Alabama, Kansas, Maryland, New York, North Carolina and Ohio) were overturned, although Alabama’s was reinstated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>Were there any states that you expected to be sued over and weren’t? It seems like all of the partisan gerrymandering activity just shifted to the state courts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I think just <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennessee</a>? There, Republicans split Nashville between three districts, turning the 5th District from safely blue to safely red. Democrats in the state <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/briefs/crowd-protests-gop-drawn-congressional-maps-on-mlk-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cried bloody murder over it</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tndp/status/1489652663197253632" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised a lawsuit</a>, but it never materialized.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Huh, I wonder if they figured it was doomed in the Tennessee state courts. Given the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-supreme-court-punt-on-partisan-gerrymandering-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literal decades of handwringing</a> over the appropriate standard for determining an unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, it’s funny that state judges really don’t seem to have had much trouble with that question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes, that’s my guess, Amelia. One clear theme from this year’s state-level lawsuits about redistricting is that the partisanship of the judges who hear the case really matters. For instance, North Carolina’s Republican gerrymander only got overturned because Democrats hold a <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/state-supreme-court-strikes-down-n-c-election-maps-with-4-3-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4-3 majority</a> on the state Supreme Court. Republicans have a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/14/maureen-oconnor-republicans-gerrymander-elections-ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4-3 majority</a> on the Ohio Supreme Court, but one of those Republicans is a swing vote, and she sided with the court’s Democrats to overturn Ohio’s (Republican-drawn) map, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it hasn’t been an ironclad rule. Most notably, a New York Court of Appeals that was 100 percent appointed by Democratic governors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/nyregion/redistricting-congress-gerrymander-ny.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly voted to strike down</a> the state’s Democratic gerrymander. I think that took a lot of Democrats by surprise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> We’ve seen a general trend <a href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/4007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toward attempting to “pack” state courts</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/state-supreme-courts-are-the-next-frontier-in-politics-2022-elections-2022-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get voters more excited</a> about the results of state judicial elections. I wonder if cases like New York and Ohio will feed that trend. It wouldn’t be especially inspiring for the state of judicial independence, but there you go.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> When a majority of the Supreme Court ruled that it didn’t think partisan gerrymandering was something the highest court should rule on, is this fractured landscape of legal challenges what it had in mind?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>Chad, I think some of the justices <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were worried</a> about every gerrymander getting endlessly litigated in federal court, with judges struggling to figure out what the right calls are. So… yes? But that energy has basically shifted to state courts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Delegation is an important form of leadership!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Of course, that ruling didn’t take federal courts out of the redistricting game. For instance, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in February the Supreme Court ruled</a> that Alabama can use a House map that a lower court had ruled was likely discriminatory against Black voters. That’s not a partisan gerrymandering case, of course — it’s about what’s legal under <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act#:~:text=Section%202%20of%20the%20Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965%20prohibits,)(2)%20of%20the%20Act." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a>, which <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/does-anti-gerrymandering-campaign-threaten-minority-voting-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows courts to require</a> the creation of majority-minority districts in some situations. The goal of those districts is to give minority voters the ability to participate equally in the political process and elect representatives of their choosing. But it still signaled that the Roberts court is about to wade back into the fight over redistricting, and likely scale back the VRA <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/25/us/annotated-supreme-court-decision-on-voting-rights-act.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more than it already has</a>. So the federal courts have weighed in — just not on whether a partisan gerrymander was unconstitutional.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nathaniel, I have to confess, I was a little surprised by the Alabama ruling. It just seemed like such an open-and-shut VRA case. What was your reaction?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes, it is very possible to draw a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second predominantly Black seat</a> in Alabama, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the current interpretation of the VRA</a>, that should have made Alabama’s current map (which features just one predominantly Black seat) illegal. And that <em>is</em> what a lower-court panel initially said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> A lower-court panel that was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/07/1078292766/supreme-court-lets-alabama-use-gop-backed-map-of-the-states-congressional-distri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not especially lefty</a>, I might add! Two of the judges were Trump appointees.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> But then the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a375_d18f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put the map back in place</a>, citing the Purcell principle, or the idea that courts shouldn’t change election laws too close to an election. (I’m sure we’ll get back to Purcell in a minute.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the fact that the Supreme Court didn’t think the Alabama map was an obvious VRA violation suggested that they are setting themselves up to reinterpret/gut the VRA yet again. (The Alabama case is still pending before the court and should be handed down next year.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That part didn’t necessarily surprise me, though. This court has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-just-made-it-harder-to-fight-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very hostile to the VRA</a>. Plus, saying that Alabama had to draw a second Black seat would have essentially required Louisiana and other Southern states that have short-changed Black representation to add a Black seat too, which would be a real blow to Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>Yes, there have been signs that the conservative justices were gearing up to take aim at Section 2 of the VRA (the part that has to do with majority-minority districts). This is, of course, nearly ten years <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after the Roberts court gutted Section 5 of the VRA</a>, which allowed nine Southern states with histories of racial discrimination in voting to change their election laws without having to get permission from the federal government. Since then, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/effects-shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research has found</a> that those states have purged voters at higher rates and passed new laws restricting voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> And, regardless of how they present themselves, several justices seem pretty transparent in their desire for Republican governance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> On that note, Nathaniel, the court’s use of the Purcell principle was … interesting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Can’t believe it hasn’t been renamed the Garland Principle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>In the Alabama case, <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/2022/2/16/22937235/supreme-court-alabama-congressional-map-purcell-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the justices said</a> that it was too close to the election to change the maps, which of course favored the Republicans. <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/03/justices-decline-to-reinstate-gop-backed-congressional-voting-maps-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They said the same thing</a> when it came to North Carolina’s map, which favored Democrats. All well and good, right? But then they threw out a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that adopted the Democratic governor’s legislative maps <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/15/wisconsin-supreme-court-adopts-legislative-maps-drawn-republicans/7250042001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only four months before the primaries</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong>: Yeah, the court didn’t cite Purcell in that case, even though they did in the Alabama case when there were <em>also</em> just four months to go until the primary! The Purcell principle is a convenient tool because it can be used to suit your desired ends. Did a court strike down a map you like? You can say it’s too close to the election to make a change and undo that decision. Did a court implement a map you don’t like? You can say there’s still time to fix it and undo that decision too. There’s no specific set time period that triggers Purcell.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>And you might think that the North Carolina ruling was an uncharacteristically positive outcome for Democrats from this Supreme Court, but even though the short-term outcome was good for Democrats, that case could be <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article259191768.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very bad for them</a> in the long term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick: </strong>Why very bad in the long term?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> The Supreme Court ruled on the North Carolina map on its shadow docket, which meant that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/us/supreme-court-voting-maps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was an emergency application</a> without extensive briefing or oral argument. But the justices <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/07/supreme-court-rejects-gop-efforts-to-block-new-congressional-maps-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaled that they could take the case next term</a>. And if they do, they could end up ruling that state courts can’t change congressional maps that were drawn by state legislatures — which, given our earlier discussion about how active state courts have been this year, would be a big deal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes, this is known as the “independent state legislative doctrine.” Because the Constitution <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specifically says</a> that state legislatures are in charge of setting election law, some conservatives believe that no one else — not even state courts — can change it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> We all have the ISLD memorized, Nathaniel.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>North Carolina Republicans have already <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article259514019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a petition</a> with the Supreme Court challenging the state’s new congressional map on these grounds. If the court takes the case and rules in their favor, state courts will be taken out of the business of litigating partisan gerrymandering — in direct contradiction to that famous opinion in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rucho v. Common Cause</a>, which, in barring federal courts from deciding questions of partisan gerrymandering, specifically mentioned state constitutions as an alternative remedy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not only that, but state courts would also be barred from overturning discriminatory voter restrictions. And independent redistricting commissions could be in danger too, since they aren’t the legislature, and under the ISLD only legislatures can draw maps.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> This is another sign of how much the Supreme Court has changed since even a few years ago! Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a455_5if6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all suggested</a> that they would have blocked the North Carolina map, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that he wanted to address the question — just not on the shadow docket. Which means that Justice Amy Coney Barrett <a href="https://www.vox.com/22958543/supreme-court-gerrymandering-redistricting-north-carolina-pennsylvania-moore-toth-amy-coney-barrett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be the swing vote</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sooo Nathaniel … it seems like the court battles over this cycle of redistricting may get even fiercer, eh?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> For sure. These court battles are far from over. Several cases, like those in North Carolina and Ohio, are still pending. I expect to see multiple congressional maps tossed in the middle of the decade as courts finally get around to hearing some of these cases. And if the Supreme Court makes a precedent-shattering ruling, like gutting the VRA or embracing the ISLD, I bet several other states will reopen their congressional maps to take advantage of the new opportunities to gerrymander that are created.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick: </strong>Phew, I thought I’d have to wait until 2030 to go through all of this again.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">West Virginia and Nebraska are not swing states, which means that today’s Republican primaries will (for the most part) decide who wins the 2022 elections in them.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except in one case. Read on to see which it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> And as has already been the case in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-watch-texass-primaries-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-primary-for-ohio-senate-will-be-a-test-for-trump-but-probably-a-win-for-trumpism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-indiana-and-ohio-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primaries</a> this cycle, the biggest question tonight is whether voters choose the candidates who are more or less aligned with former President Donald Trump. According to our research,<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Monday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a> Trump has personally endorsed just four candidates running for House or governor today, but at least nine candidates for those offices have embraced or flirted with his “Big Lie” conspiracy theory, which falsely claims that the 2020 election was stolen. On the flip side, we found at least eight who acknowledged President Biden’s victory, albeit not always with confidence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two of those election doubters look set to cruise to victory today, while two election affirmers also look likely to prevail. But there are also several primaries where the winner is uncertain, including two absolute barnstormers. So without further ado, here’s a complete guide to today’s races.</p>



<h2><strong>West Virginia</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 2nd Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7:30 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of only three states to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/2020-census-data-release.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose population</a> between the 2010 and 2020 censuses, West Virginia lost a House seat when <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">districts were reapportioned</a> last year, which meant that at least one of the state’s three Republican representatives would find themselves out of a job. Today we find out who that star-crossed statesman will be, as incumbent Reps. David McKinley and Alex Mooney <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/10/15/redistricting-pits-mckinley-vs-mooney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face off</a> in West Virginia’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly drawn</a> <strong>2nd District</strong>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As FiveThirtyEight wrote earlier this year, it’s the first <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-6-house-races-where-incumbents-are-likely-to-face-another-incumbent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incumbent-vs.-incumbent primary of 2022</a>, and based on the geography of their old districts, McKinley started with the advantage: 66 percent of the 2nd District overlaps with his old turf in northern West Virginia, while only 34 percent overlaps with Mooney’s old Eastern Panhandle-and-central-West Virginia seat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Mooney has <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/11/15/trump-backs-mooney-in-face-off-against-current-colleague-mckinley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>, the holy grail in any Republican primary but <em>especially</em> in West Virginia, which was Trump’s second-best state in the 2020 presidential general election. Mooney is a die-hard Trump follower who voted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to certify</a> the results of the 2020 election; McKinley, meanwhile, is more of a bridge builder, both literally (he voted for Biden’s <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/11/12/mckinley-mooney-square-off-on-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan infrastructure package</a>) and figuratively (he voted in favor of a <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/05/19/us-house-approves-jan-6-commission-mckinley-one-of-35-republican-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan commission</a> to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McKinley’s infrastructure vote has been a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/12/gop-primary-west-virginia-infrastructure-00024473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major bone of contention</a> in the race, too, with Mooney and his allies at the anti-government-spending Club for Growth using it as a line of attack. But on the campaign trail, McKinley has actually leaned into his vote, given that West Virginia is slated to receive at least <a href="https://mountainstatespotlight.org/2021/11/19/bidens-infrastructure-bill-wv-roads-bridges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6 billion</a> from the bill over the next five years, although he has still tried to tie himself to Trump in his <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/b0ddfcdb-739a-4b2d-821d-a4a73feaeb0e?link_id=48&amp;can_id=5f27a3767bd4756f5c4ec89f31b71bbe&amp;source=email-morning-digest-pennsylvania-democrat-tries-to-get-gop-voters-to-nominate-qanon-ally-for-governor&amp;email_referrer=email_1535058&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-pennsylvania-democrat-tries-to-get-gop-voters-to-nominate-qanon-ally-for-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign ads</a>. McKinley, a seventh-generation West Virginian, has also repeatedly dinged Mooney, a former <em>Maryland</em> state senator, for <a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/politics/maryland-gop-veteran-mooney-a-newcomer-to-w-va-politics/article_c12c30de-13fa-5c6f-8b4f-c45917165d12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carpetbagging into West Virginia</a> last decade to run for Congress, as well as attacking him over an <a href="https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2021/12/mckinley-hits-mooney-over-ethics-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethics investigation</a> into whether Mooney <a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/10/26/rep-alex-mooney-campaign-spent-funds-that-raise-personal-use-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent campaign funds for personal use</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s Mooney’s messages, though, that have gotten more airtime. As of April 20, Mooney had spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H4WV02080/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $5.1 million</a> on the race, while McKinley had spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0WV01072/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than $2 million</a>. It’s perhaps unsurprising, then, that an <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21898114/metronews-wv-poll-summary-slides-may-6-2022-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 27-May 4 poll</a> conducted by Research America on behalf of West Virginia MetroNews gave Mooney a lead over McKinley, 48 percent to 33 percent. With 13 percent still undecided, though, and the fact that both <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House polls</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-warning-on-the-accuracy-of-primary-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary polls</a> have wide margins of error, Mooney doesn’t have this sewn up yet.</p>



<h2><strong>Nebraska</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> Governor; 1st and 2nd congressional districts; attorney general; secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you thought last week’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-primary-for-ohio-senate-will-be-a-test-for-trump-but-probably-a-win-for-trumpism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate primary in Ohio</a> was a nail-bitingly close race between a Trump proxy and other ambitious wings of the party, just wait until you hear about the Republican primary for Nebraska <strong>governor</strong>. With the retirement of <a href="https://omaha.com/state-and-regional/candidates-exploring-runs-in-2022-governors-race-ricketts-cant-run-due-to-term-limits/article_71a4b218-3453-5dd7-b0e9-7954bb988f11.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">term-limited</a> Gov. Pete Ricketts, the job is open for the taking, and the winner of the Republican primary will be all but guaranteed of election in this deep-red state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Accordingly, there are many contenders for the crown, and they hail from three major wings of the party (Trumpist, old-guard establishment and moderate). Last year, Trump <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/trump-endorses-herbster-for-nebraska-governor-ricketts-disagrees/article_72146196-36b2-11ec-b976-f38f813df474.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> businessman Charles Herbster, a loyalist who has supported Trump’s political ambitions <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/after-ricketts-rejection-charles-herbster-touts-loyalty-to-trump/article_39780c92-3767-11ec-9508-977de9d4bc8a.html#tracking-source=article-related-bottom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from beginning to end</a>: He claims to have been at Trump Tower when Trump announced his presidential bid back in 2015, and he also attended Trump’s rally that preceded the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. However, this endorsement <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/02/trump-pete-herbster-charles-ricketts-nebraska-518392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sat very poorly with Ricketts</a>, who has seen Herbster as a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/04/trump-megadonors-cornhusker-county-485306" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political rival</a> ever since Herbster funded Ricketts’s opponent in his first gubernatorial campaign, in 2014. Ricketts even took the rare step of slamming Trump’s endorsement, attacking Herbster for allegedly moving his agricultural company out of state. A few months later, in January, Ricketts <a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/ricketts-endorses-regent-jim-pillen-in-governors-race/article_61ec366b-e5cd-5767-aefd-ad6a6995ddbf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, a wealthy pig farmer with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/18/nebraska-republican-candidates-trump-482703" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ties to the state’s agriculture industry</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But instead of Republicans coalescing behind Herbster or Pillen, this rift has created an opening for a third candidate, state Sen. Brett Lindstrom, who has a strong base of support around Omaha, the state’s largest city. A <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/25/brett-lindstrom-has-a-shot-in-governors-race-but-is-he-conservative-enough-for-nebraska-gop-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relative moderate</a>, Lindstrom has earned the backing of <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/02/25/brad-ashford-endorses-lindstrom-blood-in-gov-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even some Democrats</a>, and there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/07/us/politics/trump-endorsement-herbster-nebraska-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anecdotal reports</a> of Democrats re-registering as Republicans in order to vote for him. (<a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/03/party-registration-switch-ahead-of-primary-accelerates-as-gop-picks-up-8400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voter-registration figures</a> show that 8,256 Nebraskans have un-registered as Democrats or independents in the past two months, and almost the same number have newly registered as Republicans. If these people are switching parties to vote for Lindstrom — and that’s a big if — it could give him a small but nontrivial boost in a close race.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Buoyed by <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nebraska-gop-governors-race-pillen-outraises-opponents-herbster-self-funds-lindstrom-strong" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$11.5 million</a> of his own money, Herbster led in the <a href="https://www.neilanstrategygroup.com/_files/ugd/4093a6_b47cfdc0a77d4e35a4d03451cfe0c65c.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early polls of the race</a>, even those <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/23xwnh6copfg7m7/CONFIDENTIAL%20-%20NE%20Lindstrom%20April%20Polling%20Memo%20Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from his rivals’ campaigns</a>. But on April 14, the Nebraska Examiner dropped a <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/14/gop-state-senator-seven-other-women-say-charles-herbster-groped-them-he-denies-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bombshell report</a> that eight women had accused Herbster of unwanted sexual advances: six who said he groped their buttocks over their clothes, one who said he forcibly kissed her and one — a Republican state senator — who said he put his hand up her skirt. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump has defended his endorsee — even <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/01/trump-rallies-for-herbster-defends-fortenberry-and-attacks-bacon-sasse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holding a rally</a> on his behalf last week — but Herbster appears to have lost his front-runner status. The most recent poll not sponsored by one of the campaigns, <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/25/lindstrom-herbster-pillen-each-has-a-path-to-win-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted by the Neilan Strategy Group on April 19-20</a>, showed that the race is now anyone’s game, with Lindstrom at 28 percent, Herbster at 24 percent and Pillen at 24 percent. (A <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/endorsements-polling-and-more-trump-governor-campaigns-shift-into-overdrive/article_e48b7578-cc96-11ec-aaee-ffc4fb5eb822.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more recent poll</a> from Pillen’s campaign claims he has jumped out in front, with 31 percent, but you know what they say about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Depending on who wins, Nebraska’s next governor — who will co-certify the 2024 election results, including in Nebraska’s swingy 2nd District — will be either a believer in fair elections or something more ambiguous. Lindstrom and Pillen have both <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/the-top-four-republican-candidates-for-nebraska-governor-agree-biden-is-president/article_be2bfe00-aa33-11ec-aa07-9bac59c6bcf1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepted Biden’s election in 2020</a>, and Herbster has as well … eventually. He was once a full-throated Big Lie supporter (he said in a <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/02/25/herbster-was-schmoozing-with-trump-team-jan-5-6-as-they-detailed-plans-to-overturn-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2021 text message</a> that “this election was truly stolen from us and any one who does not believe that is not true is totally inaccurate”), so it’s fair to wonder how he’d react if a Democrat earns an electoral vote in Nebraska in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also two congressional primaries worth nodding at in the Cornhusker State. A couple months ago, I thought I’d be writing a lot more about the Republican primary for the <strong>1st District</strong>, where incumbent Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, who had been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/campaigns-nebraska-indictments-omaha-campaign-contributions-015e1a7c565c3287117144830dc5bb6d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicted for allegedly lying to the FBI</a> about illegal donations made to his campaign, was facing a serious challenge from state Sen. Mike Flood. However, on March 24, Fortenberry was <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/crime-and-courts/jeff-fortenberry-found-guilty-on-all-3-counts/article_a34d09ca-aba6-11ec-abc5-6fe2776c6cd8.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convicted</a> and <a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/fortenberry-to-resign-from-congress-setting-the-stage-for-special-election/article_39de00a2-3daa-5ab8-a836-77253185631e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned from Congress</a> shortly thereafter. That left the 1st District an open seat, and though there are four Republicans still in the running,<a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortenberry’s name will &lt;a href="https://www.graydc.com/2022/03/26/fortenberry-resigning-after-jury-convicts-all-three-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;still appear on the ballot&lt;/a&gt;, but he is no longer an active candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>31</sup></a> Flood looks like the odds-on favorite now; he is the only Republican left in the race who has reported <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NE/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising any money</a> as of April 20.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the one notable Democratic primary on today’s ballot is in the Omaha-based <strong>2nd District</strong>, the only competitive House seat in either of these two states. Having raised more than <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NE02132/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 million</a> as of April 20, state Sen. Tony Vargas looks like the favorite to defeat mental-health counselor Alisha Shelton, who’s pulled in only about <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NE02124/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$319,000</a>. Either would make history if they beat Republican Rep. Don Bacon<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming he wins his own primary against the underfunded Steve Kuehl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>32</sup></a> in the fall: Vargas would be the first Latino elected to Congress from Nebraska, while Shelton would be the first Black person. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, we’re also keeping a closer eye on attorney general and secretary of state races this year, given those offices’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democracy-is-on-the-ballot-in-these-11-secretary-of-state-and-attorney-general-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power to influence and even help overturn elections</a>. While Nebraska’s Republican primaries for these positions don’t look close on paper, the lack of polling and stark contrast between pro- and anti-democracy candidates still makes them worth watching. For the open <strong>attorney general</strong>’s office, virtually Nebraska’s <a href="https://www.news-journal.com/hicks-hilgers-running-for-attorney-general/article_47896243-c7db-534c-81b1-0975e7718f94.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire political establishment</a> has lined up behind state Legislature Speaker Mike Hilgers, but he still faces a challenge from home-school parent Jennifer Hicks, who believes the <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/meet-nebraskas-republican-candidates-for-attorney-general-and-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was fraudulent</a>. (As best we could tell, Hilgers has not taken a position on the issue.) And incumbent <strong>Secretary of State</strong> Bob Evnen, who <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/02/06/nebraska-secretary-of-state-pushes-back-against-claims-that-2020-vote-was-amiss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended the 2020 election</a> against claims of fraud, faces two challengers who have both questioned the election’s integrity and nodded at the conspiracy theory that voting machines changed people’s votes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We won’t be live-blogging the returns as they come in tonight, but don’t worry — we will have a quick analysis in the morning recapping all the results and what they mean for the future of the GOP.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nationally, a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-americans-stand-on-abortion-in-5-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large majority of Americans</a> support legal abortion in at least some cases, but the politics of abortion are likely to play out on the state level if Roe v. Wade is overturned. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses the types of legislation different states may adopt if Roe is struck down, and how those policies jibe with public opinion. They also discuss recent polling showing that President Biden has <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391733/biden-job-approval-down-among-younger-generations.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately lost support</a> among traditionally Democratic voting groups, such as young people, Hispanic adults and non-Hispanic Black adults.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This spring, a high school English teacher in Missouri <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/education/2022/04/07/greenfield-missouri-teacher-kim-morrison-accused-teaching-critical-race-theory-crt-loses-job/7264924001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost her job</a> following parents’ complaints that one of her assignments taught <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The teacher had assigned a worksheet titled “<a href="https://twitter.com/donmoyn/status/1515107890612350981?s=20&amp;t=FRRgahUjwR6TqxmPaTm0Bg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Racially Privileged Are You</a>?” as prep material for reading the school-approved book “Dear Martin,” a novel about a Black high school student who is physically assaulted by a white police officer. But despite the teacher’s insistence that she wasn’t teaching her students critical race theory, an academic <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal framework</a> that asserts that racism is systemic and embedded in many American institutions, the local school board disagreed and determined that the material <a href="https://www.ozarksfirst.com/local-news/local-news-local-news/why-greenfield-missouri-school-officials-decided-not-to-renew-a-teachers-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was objectionable</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Missouri incident wasn’t an anomaly. In Tennessee, a teacher was reprimanded — and later fired — after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/12/06/tennessee-teacher-fired-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telling his class that white privilege is a “fact”</a> and assigning a Ta-Nehisi Coates essay that argued that white racial resentment was responsible for the rise of former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile in Texas, a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/18/colleyville-principal-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">principal was suspended</a> after parents accused him of promoting critical race theory based on a letter he had written more than a year earlier, calling for the community to come together and defeat systemic racism in the days following the murder of George Floyd. His contract was subsequently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/11/10/texas-principal-critical-race-theory-whitfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not renewed</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In none of these schools was critical race theory actually being taught, but that is largely beside the point. Rather, these fights make up <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/critical-race-theory-invades-school-boards-help-conservative-groups-n1270794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the latest chapter in the GOP-initiated culture war</a> and are more broadly about how teachers should — and shouldn’t — talk about race and racism in America.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since January 2021, Republican state legislators have introduced nearly 200 anti-critical race theory bills in 40 states, according to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tj5WQVBmB6SQg-zP_M8uZsQQGH09TxmBY73v23zpyr0/edit#gid=1505554870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data compiled by the nonprofit organization PEN America</a>.<a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data is as of April 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>33</sup></a> According to our analysis of the 11 states that have already signed bills targeting K-12 schools into law,<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not including a law passed in Arizona that the state Supreme Court subsequently struck down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> and the 84 such bills that are still pending in state legislatures, few of these bills actually target the teaching of critical race theory. Instead, these bills are largely messaging bills that draw on talking points from the Trump administration. That said, many still seek to impose severe penalties for those found to be in violation. Even if the primary purpose of these laws seems to be to inflame the Republican base and win elections, these bills have created a chilling atmosphere for teachers who may decide to avoid discussing race, identity and contemporary issues in the classroom altogether, rather than risk their jobs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, despite governors and legislators often <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/anti-critical-race-theory-bill-signed-law-mississippi/story?id=83455412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describing these measures</a> as <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2021/12/15/governor-desantis-announces-legislative-proposal-to-stop-w-o-k-e-activism-and-critical-race-theory-in-schools-and-corporations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bans of critical race theory in schools</a>, just 17 of the 84 pending bills and two of the 11 state laws (Idaho and North Dakota) make any explicit mention of “critical race theory.” Mississippi’s law mentions critical race theory in its title but nowhere in the text. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, in the pieces of legislation that do mention critical race theory, few specify what is meant by it and the ones that do are often inaccurate. A <a href="https://legiscan.com/NJ/text/S598/id/2475574" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pending New Jersey bill</a> states that critical race theory includes ideas like one race is “inherently superior” to another and that the United States is “irredeemably racist” — <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/ted-cruz-s-erroneous-definition-critical-race-theory-explains-white-n1271484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither of which are actually tenets of critical race theory</a>. A bill introduced in South Carolina says that critical race theory <a href="https://legiscan.com/SC/text/H4799/id/2477323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes the belief that the advent of slavery</a> “constituted the true founding of the United States,” which is not a precept of critical race theory but rather a swipe at The New York Times’s 1619 Project. Incidentally, 12 of the 84 pending bills, plus <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/872/billtext/pdf/SB00003F.pdf#navpanes=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas’s law</a>, specifically forbid teaching or using the 1619 Project in a course.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, in examining the language of these pieces of legislation, we found that more than two-thirds of the pending bills and every single one of the state laws (except for North Dakota’s) contained text essentially identical to an executive order Trump issued in <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-race-sex-stereotyping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2020</a>, entitled “Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping.” That executive order didn’t actually mention critical race theory by name, but it has still served as a blueprint for Republican lawmakers trying to ban critical race theory in schools. Indeed, there has been a concerted effort to get Republican legislatures across the country to adopt language from Trump’s executive order in the bills they put forward, as evinced in circulated documents like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/critical-race-theory-guide-conservative-think-tank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Model School Board Language to Prohibit Critical Race Theory</a>,” which was produced by a conservative advocacy group founded by Trump’s former director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, these bills aren’t concerned with critical race theory as much as they are focused on enshrining Trump’s agenda in law. They’re what political scientists <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/ccameron/files/virtue_signalling_gibbs_crosson_cameron.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call message bills</a>, or “hopeless legislation constructed not to change public policy but instead to signal desirable attributes of incumbents to constituents.” But as the teacher and principal firings cited earlier suggest, these bills can still result in real harm to teachers and students alike. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the 84 proposed bills we looked at, we found that 47 outlined punishments for those found to be in violation of the legislation. The most common punishment, found in 27 of the pending bills as well as two of the state laws, is financial — often involving fines or funding cuts for the school or district, generally imposed by a school board or governing state agency. Two other common punishments, include legal action brought by parents, students or the state’s attorney general against a teacher or school district found to be in violation (11 bills) and the termination of a teacher accused of promoting critical race theory (12 bills). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An additional 15 bills imposed other forms of disciplinary action, such as verbal or written reprimands, revocation of certifications and school accreditations, suspension without pay or corrective action plans for school curricula.</p>

That means these administrators must determine whether a teacher’s history lesson was sufficiently objective or whether the teacher was responsible when a student reports feeling guilt or discomfort. Some of the punishments are very severe, too. A <a href="https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB781/id/2472185" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pending Virginia state law</a>, for instance, states that anyone determined to have violated its anti-critical race theory law is guilty of a misdemeanor crime and faces termination or revocation of their teaching license. Meanwhile in Kentucky, one introduced bill would’ve allowed any person aggrieved by the violation of the law to <a href="https://legiscan.com/KY/text/HB18/id/2464451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seek damages of up to $100,000</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some bills also impose a penalty if teachers <em>don’t</em> teach something. For example, a pending <a href="https://legiscan.com/IL/text/HB5494/id/2495484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois bill mandates</a> that students be taught that socialism and similar political systems would lead to the overthrow of the United States, and it would punish any school board found to be in violation with fines of up to $5,000 per student. In Missouri, meanwhile, <a href="https://legiscan.com/MO/text/HB1835/id/2541812/Missouri-2022-HB1835-Comm_Sub.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one proposal mandates</a> that teachers explore the “contending perspectives” of contemporary controversial issues, meaning both sides of the racist <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/conspiracy-theories-cant-be-stopped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replacement theory</a> currently being pushed by some far-right commentators must be presented while the 1619 Project would be effectively banned from the classroom by other bills currently pending in the state legislature. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These bills often don’t give accused teachers an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges, either. For instance, the Missouri teacher who was fired for assigning the racial privilege worksheet was let go by the school board in a closed-door session that she was not permitted to attend. Upon being notified of the board’s decision, <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/education/2022/04/07/greenfield-missouri-teacher-kim-morrison-accused-teaching-critical-race-theory-crt-loses-job/7264924001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she said</a>, “If this is how they terminate teachers — without asking questions, without speaking to the teacher — then no one is secure.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though only 11 of the nearly 200 anti-critical race theory bills introduced in the last year and a half have been signed into law, the very presence of these bills, including their often ambiguous language, have created a chilling atmosphere for teachers who may decide to avoid discussing race, identity and contemporary issues in the classroom altogether, rather than risk losing their jobs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take Jen Given, a 10th grade history teacher in New Hampshire. She used to teach her students about racial economic disparities via lessons on Jim Crow laws, redlining and other topics. However, following the passage of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/teachers-hampshire-face-legal-threats-teaching-called-divisive/story?id=81213142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bill that included anti-critical race theory provisions</a> in June of last year, she stopped including those subjects in her curriculum. “The law is really, really vague,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/02/14/critical-race-theory-teachers-fear-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she told The Washington Post</a> this year, continuing, “We asked for clarification from the state, from the union, from school lawyers. The universal response is no one’s really sure.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The ultimate effect of these laws appears to create uncertainty for teachers and administrators, while deputizing parents and students to shape school curricula and influence how — or in some cases, if — teachers discuss difficult aspects of our history and contemporary society.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Late Monday, we learned that the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be ready to overturn Roe v. Wade</a>, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abortion is a thorny issue in American life. It’s not something people like to talk about, and it’s not something people know that much about. Because of that, it’s hard to understand <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how Americans really think about abortion</a> and how many Americans would react if Roe were overturned. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is one point, though, in this debate that is clear: The majority of Americans don’t want to overturn Roe. How polls ask about support varies, but the vast majority of respondents — somewhere between 85 and 90 percent, according to most polls — think abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="976" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.01.png" alt='Stacked bar chart of the share of U.S. adults who said abortion should be illegal or legal in all or most circumstances in four different polls, showing that few Americans support making abortion fully illegal and that the majority of responds chose options that limited legal abortion to “some” or “most cases," or included caveats for specific circumstances or restrictions.' data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.01.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.01.png?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.01.png?w=2048 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="1852" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.01-mob.png" alt='Stacked bar chart of the share of U.S. adults who said abortion should be illegal or legal in all or most circumstances in four different polls, showing that few Americans support making abortion fully illegal and that the majority of responds chose options that limited legal abortion to “some” or “most cases," or included caveats for specific circumstances or restrictions.' data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.01-mob.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.01-mob.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.01-mob.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">We only have one poll taken after the Supreme Court draft opinion was leaked, but <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/05/04/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a May 3 Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> also found that most don’t want to overturn Roe — albeit a slim majority, just 50 percent of registered voters. (This represented a small uptick in support from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/12/07/roe-v-wade-abortion-supreme-court-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last time</a> Morning Consult asked the question in December, when 45 percent of registered voters supported upholding Roe.) Other polls taken within the last year have found identical or higher levels of support: <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MLSPSC04Toplines.html#H1:_FavorOppose_strike_down_Roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 percent</a> in a Marquette Law School poll, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_092021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">62 percent</a> in a Monmouth University poll and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/politics/cnn-poll-abortion-roe-v-wade/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">69 percent</a> in a CNN/SSRS one. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ feelings about abortion vary, though. Support for abortion in very Republican-leaning states, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/upshot/polling-abortion-states.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially in the South</a>, is low. Polls have found that support for abortion can change depending on the situation, too. For instance, there’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more support</a> for legal abortions in the cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the most significant ways in which support for abortion varies depends on when in the pregnancy the abortion is perfomed. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls have found</a> that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/only-on-ap-us-supreme-court-abortion-religion-health-2c569aa7934233af8e00bef4520a8fa8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large majority</a> of Americans support abortion in the first trimester, but that support tends to drop in the second trimester.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1852" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.02.png" alt="Pie charts showing the share of U.S. adults who said abortion should be generally legal in the first or second trimester of pregnancy and who said they would or would not like to see the Supreme Court overturn Roe v.

Many Americans simply don’t know a lot about abortion — including its legality and accessibility where they live.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An ABC News/Washington Post poll</a> conducted before Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion leaked found that people don’t know much about the current abortion landscape. According to the poll, only 30 percent of residents living in the 22 states that have passed abortion restrictions since 2020 were aware of the restrictions in their states, while 44 percent said they weren’t aware and 26 percent said they were unsure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This lack of knowledge likely extends to the post-Roe landscape as well: <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in late 2019</a> found that only 38 percent of people who lived in states where abortion would become illegal if Roe were overturned were aware of their state’s laws on the subject. Similarly, only 35 percent of people who lived in states where abortion would remain legal knew that was the case.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/what-if-roe-fell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Center for Reproductive Rights</a>, a group that advocates for abortion rights, abortion would become illegal in about half the country if Roe were overturned. Its metric indicates that 24 states would likely ban abortion outright if Roe is weakened or overturned. In the other 26 states and the District of Columbia, abortion would likely remain legal — although some states have done more than others to <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/04/01/blue-states-enact-new-laws-to-create-abortion-havens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ensconce abortion rights in state law</a> or even proactively expand access.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Abortion would be restricted in many states without Roe" aria-label="Map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IkDVl/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="493" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The fact that most Americans know so little about the current abortion landscape means it’s really hard to understand how public opinion would change if Roe were overturned.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of this equation is the question of who would be affected most by a broader loss of abortion access. As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-abortion-has-changed-since-1973/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight wrote earlier this year</a>, who gets an abortion has changed a lot since the Roe ruling came down in 1973. Abortion patients are now much likelier to be nonwhite and low-income than they were 50 years ago.</p>

But given what we know about the racial disparities <a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/disparities-in-health-and-health-care-5-key-question-and-answers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in health outcomes and health care</a>, particularly for Black and Hispanic people, this shift suggests that the most vulnerable members of our society will be most affected by the overturning of Roe.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also likely why there hasn’t been more political ire about the wave of restrictions that have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/abortion-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already made it much more difficult</a> to get an abortion in some parts of the country — the experiences of the people who struggle most with the restrictions are easy for most Americans to ignore. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is it might take time for the impact of the loss of abortion access to sink in with the broader public, given that low-income women <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2017/04/barriers-abortion-care-and-their-consequences-patients-traveling-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are likelier</a> to simply have to carry a pregnancy to term, while women with more wealth can consider traveling out of state for an abortion. That said, if abortion is banned in large swaths of the country, a broader crossection of women will be affected — which could mean that the new restrictions have a more dramatic impact on mainstream public opinion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are already some signs that, as abortion restrictions have increased across the country, Democrats have gotten more motivated to vote based on the issue. After the Supreme Court allowed a highly restrictive abortion law to go into effect in Texas last fall, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-may-now-motivate-democrats-more-than-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the share of Biden voters who said abortion is a “very important” issue</a> for them jumped, while the share of Trump voters who said the same thing fell.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="944" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yi-atd.abortion-views-in-charts.05.png" alt="Scatterplot with trend lines of the share of Trump and Biden voters who say abortion is a “very important” issue from February 2021 to October 2021, showing that abortion is now more important to Democrats than Republicans.

Overturning Roe would represent a much bigger change than, say, an individual state’s restriction, which could mean that Democrats are especially angry about the issue going into the fall’s midterm elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether that could reshape the outcome of the midterms is, of course, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-could-strike-down-roe-v-wade-what-would-that-mean-for-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an open question</a>, since the overall environment is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable to Republicans right now</a> and voters are very concerned about <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/02/16/publics-top-priority-for-2022-strengthening-the-nations-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other issues</a>. But at the very least, a Supreme Court ruling that abruptly ends the constitutional right to abortion would vault the issue to the center of the political conversation — and change Americans’ lives in ways that many people may not expect.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (May 9, 10:05 a.m.):</strong> A chart has been updated to better describe how access to abortion will change in states that would not protect abortion if Roe v. Wade were weakened or overturned.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The governor’s mansion has recently been a strong point for Republicans, as they’ve held a majority of the country’s governorships since the 2010 election. In fact, <a href="https://governors.rutgers.edu/fast-facts-about-americas-governors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they currently control 28 governorships to the Democrats’ 22</a>, and with 36 governorships up this year, they could widen that advantage, especially considering that President Biden’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating is in the low 40s</a> and the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national political environment</a> looks friendly toward Republicans. However, GOP gains in 2022 are not a given. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As it turns out, the two most likely seats to flip may be Maryland and Massachusetts, where popular Republican governors are leaving office, and the GOP could end up nominating candidates who struggle to appeal in those deep-blue states. Meanwhile, primary battles in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin could also hurt GOP efforts to capture Democratic-held governorships. After all, while gubernatorial races <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have become more nationalized</a>, voters still show a greater tendency to break from their baseline partisan preferences in these races than in contests for Congress, meaning a poor nominee can still cause the seemingly favored party to stumble. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, even though Republicans have two of the toughest seats to defend this cycle, they also have their own juicy target in Kansas, the reddest state Democrats control. Moreover, Democrats hold more highly competitive seats, which could easily flip. Based on early race ratings data from <a href="https://insideelections.com/ratings/governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Elections</a>, <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2022-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a> and <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cook Political Report</a>, we’ve identified 10 states that are especially competitive, six of which Democrats currently control. This list could certainly change, but at this point, the GOP is playing on friendlier turf, as the table below shows.</p>

Inside Elections includes “Tilt” as a rating between “Toss-up” and “Lean.” This affected the median in only one race on the table: Michigan, where the median rating was “Tilt D”; we treated this as “Lean D” for easier categorization.</p>
 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with the four battleground states Democrats must defend. Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are both the GOP’s greatest pick-up opportunities and perhaps their greatest risks, since in each race only Republicans have seriously contested primaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of these states, Pennsylvania has the most wide-open race, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/a/primary-election-2022-pennsylvania-voter-registration-ballot-20220426.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with nine Republicans battling</a> to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. And while former President Donald Trump hasn’t yet<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> endorsed anyone for this race, the two leading GOP contenders are both strongly associated with him: former Rep. Lou Barletta, an <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/barletta-trump-immigration-hazleton-pennsylvania-20180716.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-immigration stalwart</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/lou-barletta-endorses-donald-trump-221099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early endorser of Trump’s 2016 campaign</a>, and state Sen. Doug Mastriano, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/14/politics/trump-pennsylvania-mastriano-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ardent defender</a> of Trump’s bogus election-fraud claims <a href="https://www.witf.org/2021/05/28/pa-sen-doug-mastriano-unlikely-to-face-consequences-over-newly-released-jan-6-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who was also on the scene</a> at the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two April polls from <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TRF-PA-22-GOP-Sen-Primary-0415-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Trafalgar Group</a> and <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/pennsylvania-2022-gop-poll-david-mccormick-leads-primary-for-u-s-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill/Emerson College</a> found Barletta and Mastriano running neck and neck for first, at around 20 percent. The only other candidates who hit double-digits in either poll were Bill McSwain, a former Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, and Dave White, a businessman and former Delaware County councilman. McSwain ran close to Barletta and Mastriano in the Trafalgar poll, but his campaign took a hit in mid-April, when <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/trump-bill-mcswain-endorsement-20220412.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump publicly opposed McSwain</a> because he felt McSwain, as a U.S. attorney, hadn’t satisfactorily addressed the fraudulent claims about the 2020 election. Meanwhile, White was around 10 percent in both surveys and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-white-republican-primary-governor-2022-delaware-county-20220427.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has self-funded his campaign a great deal</a>, but his close ties to organized labor might prove problematic for conservative primary voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A Mastriano or Barletta win could be music to the ears of presumptive Democratic nominee Josh Shapiro, though. Shapiro, the state’s attorney general, will probably face a tough race regardless of whom the GOP chooses, given the national environment. But he might find it easier to win over voters who <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2018&amp;fips=42&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly rejected Barletta</a> in the state’s 2018 Senate race (in a strongly Democratic year); alternatively, Shapiro may have little trouble portraying Mastriano as an extremist because of Mastriano’s connections to Jan. 6. Moreover, neither Republican has proven to be a strong fundraiser: As of late March, Barletta and Mastriano had each <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/04/07/shapiro-huge-first-quarter-2022-hauls-in-over-4-5-million-gubernatorial-run/stories/202204070144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought in less than $450,000</a> in campaign contributions, whereas Shapiro had raised 10 times as much. Pennsylvania is shaping up to be a governor’s race where candidate quality could make the difference.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Nevada, things are less up in the air for Republicans. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nevada-governor-race-trump-endorse-lombardo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump has endorsed Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo</a> to take on Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak. To be sure, Lombardo isn’t the only Republican running in the June 14 primary. Former Sen. Dean Heller, North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee and attorney and former boxer Joey Gilbert, who recently won the state party’s backing, have all thrown their hats in the ring, but Trump’s backing of Lombardo may help cement him as the front-runner. Gilbert, who <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/first-joey-gilbert-was-a-capitol-rioter-now-he-wants-to-be-governor-of-nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also attended the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol</a>, did just receive <a href="https://mynews4.com/news/local/sam-brown-joey-gilbert-get-endorsement-recommendations-at-nevada-gop-convention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official party endorsement</a> at the Nevada GOP’s state convention, though, which could boost his standing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even prior to Trump’s endorsement, Lombardo already held at least a <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CfGPAC_NV-Statewide_PollMemo_220320.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small lead</a> in two surveys <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/dem-poll-lombardo-leads-gop-gov-primary-but-support-looks-soft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted in March</a>, and surveys conducted by <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TRF-NV-GOP-0430-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar</a> and <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/nevada-2022-trump-endorsed-laxalt-and-lombardo-emerge-as-leaders-in-republican-senate-gubernatorial-primaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill/Emerson College</a> following Trump’s endorsement confirm Lombardo still has an edge, although his support hasn’t dramatically grown. But Lombardo also has a <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-raises-800k-has-five-times-hellers-haul-in-2022-first-quarter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly $3 million campaign war chest</a>, which far outpaces that of the other major contenders. Provided Lombardo wins his party’s nod, he could be well-positioned to defeat Sisolak in the general election, despite the incumbent’s nearly $10 million in the bank. An early-April <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/04_12_2022_complete_marginals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reno Gazette-Journal/Suffolk University poll</a> of likely voters found Lombardo and Sisolak both running just shy of 40 percent. A Nevada Independent/OH Predictive Insights poll from around the same time <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-sisolak-leads-likely-gop-governor-opponents-but-favorability-remains-underwater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did find Sisolak leading Lombardo</a> by 9 percentage points, but neither held a majority and Lombardo still performed the best of any Republican candidate tested in the poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Republican primaries in Michigan and Wisconsin aren’t as crowded as the one in Pennsylvania, but a lot could still change in both races since Trump hasn’t weighed in<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> and each primary takes place in August. In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer looks likeliest to face former Detroit police Chief James Craig, and early general election polling <a href="https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2022/01/2022-January-Statewide-MEDIA-FREQUENCY.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests he could be</a> competitive <a href="https://blueprintpolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BPP-Michigan-Survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">against her</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Craig’s campaign has encountered some challenges, including <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/21/james-craig-governor-campaign-loses-2nd-campaign-manager-4-months/9454132002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a merry-go-round of campaign managers</a> and a <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/25/rep-bergman-switches-endorsement-michigan-republican-governor-race/7441388001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost endorsement</a> from GOP Rep. Jack Bergman. It’s possible, too, that Craig will face competition in the primary. A <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MI-Gov-GOP-0331-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late-March survey</a> from the Trafalgar Group found businessman Perry Johnson and chiropractor Garrett Soldano both polling around 15 percent, while Craig pulled in 34 percent. Johnson <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/13/super-bowl-ad-touts-gop-governor-hopeful-perry-johnson-quality-guru/6771855001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has cast himself</a> as a conservative “quality guru” and <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/04/michigan-governor-candidates-cant-read-trumps-mind-but-many-think-he-will-endorse-them.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has self-funded</a> much of his campaign. Soldano, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/02/01/garrett-soldano-abortion-michigan-republican-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has made headlines</a> for opposing the right to an abortion even in the case of rape. They’re not the only ones trying to thwart Craig, either. Conservative radio host Tudor Dixon, self-funding businessman Kevin Rinke and Ryan Kelley, a real estate agent who was <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/michigan-governor-candidate-who-joined-us-capitol-riot-calls-it-energizing-event-1579288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6</a>, are all in the mix as well. However, one wild card here is whether some of these candidates fail to qualify for the primary ballot: Michigan Democrats <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/michigan-democrats-accuse-gop-candidates-using-forged-signatures-get-b-rcna26697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have launched challenges</a> to the petition signatures of Craig, Johnson and Dixon, and an outside group allied with Dixon <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan/2022/04/26/challenge-filed-against-james-craigs-petition-signatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has questioned</a> Craig’s signatures.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Wisconsin, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch looks most likely to win the GOP primary and advance to take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. A late-April poll from <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MLSP69Toplines.html#Q40a:_Rep_primary_for_Gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marquette University Law School found her</a> at 32 percent, with businessman Kevin Nicholson as the only other Republican to crack double-digits, at 10 percent. Even <a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/220406Fight.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent poll from a pro-Nicholson super PAC</a> found Kleefisch leading Nicholson, 42 percent to 29 percent, among likely voters. Businessman Tim Michels, who <a href="https://www.news-journal.com/tim-michels-formally-launches-largely-self-funded-campaign-for-governor/article_ea87e6f8-a8b2-589e-8146-18711f6e8ac6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered the race only last week</a> and announced plans to largely self-fund his campaign, is a relative unknown at this point. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kleefisch may just have the right combination of grassroots and institutional support to win. She served as lieutenant governor for eight years under then-Gov. Scott Walker, who <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2015/0713/Scott-Walker-2016-rock-star-or-villain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned praise from conservatives</a> while in office and <a href="https://www.wisconsinrightnow.com/2022/02/17/scott-walker-endorses-rebecca-kleefisch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has endorsed Kleefisch</a>. She’s also worked to shore up her support among conservatives — and win over Trump — by <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/27/rebecca-kleefisch-says-2020-election-rigged-compares-deflategate/9551852002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changing her stance</a> on the 2020 election, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-wisconsin-donald-trump-elections-election-2020-3f8fa22c09c36481c5a4aa904500f068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having gone from accepting Biden’s victory</a> in the state to now saying that the election was “rigged.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those four states make up the battleground governorships Democrats must defend, but Republicans have their own to defend in Georgia and Arizona. It’s a heated GOP primary in Georgia, too, with incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp facing former Sen. David Perdue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a race where Trump’s endorsement might fall flat, though. Trump <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/former-pres-trump-endorses-former-senator-david-perdue-georgia-governors-race/PTKYT6GGQNEBDIWX3NTRF4HJOU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Perdue in February</a>, as he was upset that Kemp had not overturned Georgia’s 2020 election results. But recent polls suggest Perdue is significantly behind Kemp and might not even be able to force a runoff in the May 24 primary. (Georgia is <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-runoffs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of seven states</a> that require a primary winner to garner majority support.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/georgia-governor-gop-primary-kemp-leads-perdue-insideradvantage-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 5 Atlanta/InsiderAdvantage poll</a> released this week found Kemp at 54 percent and Perdue at 38 percent, <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A1128c1c6-549a-3f16-8cf2-7f84162a9d61" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a finding</a> echoed <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=eaa28cb5-62e6-438f-a7ed-bbabb6478a06" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by five</a> other <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/georgia-shows-limits-of-trump-endorsements-with-perdue-flop-walker-surge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys conducted</a> from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z8o3QDQ2mqow1YMnaRryq3OXrECD54O6/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mid-April</a> through <a href="https://twitter.com/HotlineJosh/status/1521470084383920131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early May</a>. Kemp may have angered Trump, but he <a href="https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/politics/georgia-republicans-ready-conservative-legislative-agenda-for-campaign-trail/article_e7c240a6-b03c-52a4-8706-d3ed2fd76df7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has pursued a conservative policy agenda</a> in cooperation with the GOP-controlled legislature and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/28/governor-approval-ratings-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has remained relatively popular at home</a>. A Kemp victory would be good news for the GOP, too, as <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21583198/cygnal-general-election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general election polling</a> suggests that Kemp <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/georgia-2022-poll-herschel-walker-leads-senator-warnock-49-to-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a safer bet</a> than Perdue to defeat Stacey Abrams, Kemp’s 2018 foe and the presumptive Democratic nominee in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in Arizona, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/28/politics/trump-endorses-kari-lake-arizona-governor/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s candidate</a>, former television anchor and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/16/politics/fact-check-kari-lake-arizona-governor-election-lies/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Lie proponent</a> Kari Lake, is doing just fine. She is her party’s front-runner, having led all publicly released polls in the race to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. The <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/az-gov-gop-april-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent survey from Trafalgar</a> put Lake at 38 percent, ahead of former state Board of Regents Secretary Karrin Taylor Robson (27 percent) and former Rep. Matt Salmon (11 percent). That’s not too different from two early-April polls from <a href="https://twitter.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1511794690953252876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Orbital</a> and <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/az-gop-gov-race-lake-leads-robson-climbing-salmon-stalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights</a> that also gave Lake a lead and put Robson in second.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Things are more competitive in the campaign-finance department, however, as Lake has <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2023%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent just $1.7 million</a>, compared with Robson’s <a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/subscriber/republican-karrin-taylor-robson-spending-big-in-crowded-race-for-governor/article_4c811d06-be7b-11ec-aba0-f3917c691c74.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6.1 million</a>, including nearly $4 million she has loaned her campaign. This money edge could potentially help Robson, too, as she has been able to spend far more resources to push her message (Salmon has spent around $940,000). Although there isn’t <em>that</em> much of a difference between the candidates’ messages at this point — all three, for instance, <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/12/23/promises-to-complete-border-wall-iffy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">want to finish the U.S.-Mexico border fence</a>. That said, Lake, as Trump’s pick, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kari-lake-mark-finchem-voting-machines-lawsuit-rcna26035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has played up</a> his false claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent, so Robson’s money might not be enough to overcome Lake in the Aug. 2 primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For their part, Democrats look likely to choose Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. Having <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2022%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised twice as much</a> as her opponents, former state Rep. Aaron Lieberman and former Nogales Mayor Marco López, Hobbs is in a strong position in the Democratic primary. However, Hobbs has still had to deal with her share of controversy; specifically, <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/11/18/exclusive-katie-hobbs-def" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2015 firing</a> of a Black woman staffer who worked under Hobbs has generated some negative publicity since a federal jury <a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/katie-hobbs-apologizes-talonya-adams-racial-discrimination/75-7e2b887d-6d59-4033-9e8a-63b5b3245c48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided last year</a> that the staffer had been a victim of racial and sex discrimination. Still, Democrats are hoping that a controversial GOP nominee like Lake might give them an opening in Arizona despite a GOP-leaning environment, and <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/5a280d25318f2afe3f311adb6/files/d6a3cca7-82f2-3fde-5ceb-2d07317cf5e8/PUBLIC_Toplines_AZ_General_022222.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited general election polling</a> has shown Hobbs <a href="https://redfieldandwiltonstrategies.com/magnified-email/issue-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running either slightly ahead</a> or behind Lake, Robson and Salmon.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Aside from Georgia and Arizona, Republicans have two other, even more vulnerable seats they must defend, as outgoing GOP governors in deep-blue Maryland and Massachusetts could very easily be replaced by Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Maryland, a huge Democratic field has developed in the race to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. To the extent there’s a favorite, <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/03/23/baker-poll-finds-a-four-way-battle-among-democrats-running-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it might be</a> Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot, a four-term officeholder who also had the most money in the bank <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/01/20/millions-roll-into-gubernatorial-candidates-war-chests-but-some-lag-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as of mid-January</a>. But Franchot <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/peter-franchot-marylands-tax-collector-considers-a-run-for-governor/2019/08/24/e74005c4-bea5-11e9-a5c6-1e74f7ec4a93_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a fiscal conservative</a> who might rub some liberals in the state the wrong way, so it’s still entirely possible that former Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker, former Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez or former Secretary of Education John King <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/maryland/exclusive-new-polling-franchot-wes-moore-new-endorsement/65-8623dd38-1bfb-42cc-a26a-66354fe99aec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a splash</a>. Other wild cards are author Wes Moore and former nonprofit executive Jon Baron — Moore has raised a ton of money and has polled decently, while Baron has self-funded a great deal. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for the GOP field, it’s largely a race between Kelly Schulz, a former Hogan cabinet member who has her <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/22/hogan-endorses-schulz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old boss’s support</a>, and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/582727-trump-endorses-challenger-to-hogan-ally-in-maryland-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-endorsed</a> state Del. Daniel Cox. Schulz has the fundraising edge and would probably be a stronger general election candidate, but Cox might best her in the July 19 primary because he’s better aligned with the current ideological direction of the GOP. Maryland <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is one of the bluest states in the country</a>, however, so even though Hogan managed to win the state in 2014 and hold it in 2018, the state’s lean will make it a good pickup opportunity for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In even-bluer Massachusetts, both parties have clear front-runners in the open-seat race to succeed Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, so there’s less uncertainty as to what the general election matchup will look like. But this seat could prove more challenging than Maryland’s for Republicans to hold onto. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have a strong candidate in state Attorney General Maura Healey, who <a href="https://www.uml.edu/docs/20220419-MA-Dem-Primary-Topline_tcm18-351512.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a clear lead</a> in <a href="https://www.massincpolling.com/the-topline/poll-release-new-numbers-on-2022-democratic-primary-races" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary polls</a> over state Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz. Healey also handily won her office in 2014 and 2018, and <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/01/20/its-official-ag-healey-declares-for-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was widely expected to run</a> if Baker decided to retire rather than seek a third term. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl, the Republican front-runner who has <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/10/06/donald-trump-geoff-diehl-massachusetts-charlie-baker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>, is a bit more of a mixed bag, however. He <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/02/02/is-everyone-underestimating-geoff-diehl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has increasingly embraced false claims</a> that the 2020 election result was fraudulent, and that isn’t likely to play well given the state’s deep-blue hue, even if the state has shown a penchant for electing Republican governors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After all, <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2016/05/04/baker-will-not-vote-for-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baker was</a> critical <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/02/charlie-baker-trump-outrageous-956832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of Trump</a> and <a href="https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/stateofstatebakercrosstabs-1637252877.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a better approval rating among Democrats</a> than Republicans not long before <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/12/01/governor-charlie-baker-third-term-reelection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he announced his retirement</a>. It’s possible businessman Chris Doughty, <a href="https://commonwealthmagazine.org/politics/chris-doughty-i-almost-feel-like-a-governor-already/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who compares himself</a> to the moderate Baker, can put up a competitive showing against Diehl in the Sept. 6 primary, but at this point, Doughty hasn’t gained as much traction among Republicans in the state. And either way, Republicans in Massachusetts might be in trouble as a <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/massachusetts2/2022/05_02_2022_marginals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston Globe/Suffolk University survey</a> fielded in late April found Healey up 27 points on Diehl and 30 points on the less well-known Doughty.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans aren’t the only ones with hard seats to defend, however. Democrats also control two seats that Republicans could easily pick up. In fact, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly is the most vulnerable incumbent governor seeking reelection in the country. She <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2018&amp;fips=20&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly won</a> in a pro-Democratic environment in 2018, with 48 percent of the vote, mostly because she was running against a weak, divisive Republican opponent. Now, though, she will face three-term Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who might do a better job uniting the GOP in this deep-red state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Things aren’t quite as dire for Democrats in Maine, but Democratic Gov. Janet Mills could still find herself in trouble in this purplish state. She will face former Gov. Paul LePage, who served as governor from 2011 to 2019. Working in Mills’s favor, though, is that LePage is a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/23/paul-lepage-is-back-and-maine-is-terrified-513745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarizing figure</a> in the state, which could give her enough of a boost to win reelection. At the very least, this state doesn’t lean toward either party so much that a Democratic win in a Republican-leaning environment would be unheard of.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And there are, of course, plenty of other interesting intraparty contests in states where one party has a clear advantage — like an <a href="https://www.klkntv.com/nebraska-governors-race-independent-poll-shows-statistical-three-way-tie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exciting three-way Republican primary</a> in deep-red Nebraska — or wide-open GOP primaries in Democratic-leaning states that could come into play because of the national environment, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/04/14/a-month-out-no-gop-candidate-has-lock-on-governors-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like in Minnesota</a>. But the 10 states we’ve examined here will likely have the most influence on how much state-level clout Democrats and Republicans have after the dust settles this November.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): It’s possible that Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion, is about to be overturned.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Late on Monday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico published</a> a draft Supreme Court opinion that indicates a majority of the court’s conservative justices are ready to overturn Roe. There’s still a lot we don’t know at this point, including whether this opinion has changed — the draft Politico obtained is dated Feb. 10, and Supreme Court opinions often involve multiple drafts and revisions — or who leaked it. (Chief Justice John Roberts said in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chief-justice-roberts-responds-leaked-supreme-court-draft/story?id=84468850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> Tuesday that the draft was authentic, but that it “does not represent a decision by the Court or the final position of any member.”) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But regardless of whether this opinion is final, the court deciding to overturn Roe this term has always been a distinct possibility. It’s something, too, that has far-ranging implications for both abortion access in the U.S. and the upcoming midterm elections, so let’s discuss in three parts the politics of Roe being overturned.</p>



<ol><li>First, what kind of political fights can we expect to see if Roe were overturned? <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-banning-abortion-illegal_n_62708a04e4b04a9ff89efac6">Abortion access in the U.S.</a> would be dramatically curtailed, but changes to abortion access would hardly be uniform. What kinds of fights should we expect to see play out in the states (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/states-arent-waiting-for-the-supreme-court-to-rule-on-abortion/">or are already playing out</a>)? In Congress?</li><li>Second, abortion has long motivated Republicans more than Democrats, but there are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-may-now-motivate-democrats-more-than-republicans/">signs that calculus is changing</a>. Could abortion — especially if the court overturns Roe — shake up the upcoming midterm elections?</li><li>Finally, let’s take a step back and talk more broadly about where Americans stand on abortion. We know that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/">Americans have a complicated relationship to abortion</a> and support a variety of restrictions, but at the same time, most Americans do not want Roe overturned. This means that if the court were to overturn Roe, they would <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-big-rulings-were-surprisingly-mainstream-this-year/">be out of step with public opinion</a>. Isn’t this a risky position for the court to be in?</li></ol><p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with that first question. What political fights can we expect to see if Roe were overturned?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/amelia-thomson-deveaux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</a>, senior writer): Well, to state the obvious, abortion is going to become illegal in much of the country almost immediately. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/10/26-states-are-certain-or-likely-ban-abortion-without-roe-heres-which-ones-and-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the Guttmacher Institute</a>, 22 states are certain to quickly ban abortion, and a few more could follow. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, we’ve already seen a slew of laws <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/states-arent-waiting-for-the-supreme-court-to-rule-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced since the start of this year</a> that ban abortion at various stages of pregnancy — ranging from a 15-week ban in states like Florida and Arizona, to a near-total ban in Oklahoma.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="2080" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/atd.state-abortion-legislation.1.png" alt="Maps of the number and types of provisions that state legislatures have enacted in 2022 to restrict abortion access, as of May 3, 2022, at 12 p.m. Eastern. Nine states have enacted nearly three-dozen abortion restrictions, including a near-total ban in Oklahoma and a trigger ban in Wyoming (which became the 13th state to enact such a ban)." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/atd.state-abortion-legislation.1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/atd.state-abortion-legislation.1.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/atd.state-abortion-legislation.1.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="3786" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/atd.state-abortion-legislation.1m.png" alt="Maps of the number and types of provisions that state legislatures have enacted in 2022 to restrict abortion access, as of May 3, 2022, at 12 p.m. Eastern. Nine states have enacted nearly three-dozen abortion restrictions, including a near-total ban in Oklahoma and a trigger ban in Wyoming (which became the 13th state to enact such a ban)." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/atd.state-abortion-legislation.1m.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/atd.state-abortion-legislation.1m.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/atd.state-abortion-legislation.1m.png?w=1240 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This push has mostly been concentrated in red states where Republicans are in power, but one development that’s particularly notable is legislators and governors are not just trying to ban abortion in their states — they’re also trying to threaten blue-state abortion providers who accept red-state patients. Take Missouri. Lawmakers there <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/missouri-make-harder-state-abortions-83483992" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a proposal earlier this year</a> that’s aimed at making it legal to sue anyone who aids a Missouri resident in obtaining an abortion, regardless of where they live. That hasn’t become law yet, but I imagine we’ll see a lot more of those types of measures if Roe is gone — especially if <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-can-expect-if-abortion-pills-become-their-only-safe-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more women are turning to the internet</a> to get abortion pills. Anti-abortion legislators will try to restrict their ability to do that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, on the other side of the aisle, several blue states where Democrats are in power are expanding abortion access, making it easier and cheaper to get an abortion. <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/2022/04/california-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We’re already</a> seeing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/nyregion/connecticut-texas-abortion-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of those efforts</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bottom line is that if Roe were overturned, it would be incredibly chaotic — which is saying something, because it’s already tumultuous — and would likely involve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Texas-style laws</a> where citizens file vigilante lawsuits.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): Yeah, this is example No. 48,329 of why state-level politics are important — maybe more important than federal politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst): Republicans are also in a better position to push laws that ban abortions — if they haven’t already. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Currently, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_February_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans have full control of the government</a> in 22 states, while Democrats only have “trifectas” in 14 states. The other 13 states have divided governments (<a href="https://news.ballotpedia.org/2021/02/22/alaska-house-organizes-under-multi-partisan-coalition-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Alaska</a>), but some of those states are pretty Republican and could fall under full GOP control in 2022 or 2023, such as Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>amelia:</strong> Lawmakers are also already thinking ahead to a post-Roe future. Because the fact is, a neighboring state offering abortion services is a big problem for anti-abortion lawmakers. For instance, there is currently no way to stop Missouri residents from going over the border to get an abortion in Illinois, which significantly undermines Missouri Republicans’ efforts if their goal is to end abortion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> But if Roe were overturned at the federal level, could we expect a federal-level response? Earlier this year, for instance, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/03/abortion-roe-wade-codify-bernie-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats in Congress moved to codify Roe</a> into federal law, protecting the right to abortion nationwide. It passed the House, but it failed to get enough support in the Senate, largely because Sen. Joe Manchin joined Republicans in blocking the bill.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Presumably, though, this is a fight we’re going to see Democrats take up again? President Biden, for instance, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-reacts-apparent-draft-supreme-court-opinion-abortion/story?id=84467397" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a written statement on Tuesday</a>, “[W]e will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> I don’t know, Sarah. Abortion is just really hard to deal with at the national level. After all, one reason this has largely been a state-level battle since the 1980s is because the anti-abortion movement failed to pass <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/12/17/panel-backs-anti-abortion-amendment/abedf77c-ede1-447c-b8d2-44b2d8179d7f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a federal constitutional amendment</a> banning abortion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/15/us/opposing-sides-step-up-efforts-on-abortion-measure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the decade after Roe</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not to say that Republicans won’t try to ban abortion if they get control of Congress and the White House — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/02/abortion-ban-roe-supreme-court-mississippi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m sure they will</a> — but even that will be difficult unless they get rid of the filibuster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): Exactly. Scrapping the filibuster will definitely become a pressing topic once again. While Congress does technically have the ability to codify the legal principles outlined in Roe, doing so would require Democrats in the Senate to get rid of the 60-vote threshold needed to pass legislation, given their one-vote majority in the chamber currently. And as we’ve written time and time again, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain senators</a> have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kyrsten-sinema-is-confounding-her-own-party-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been opposed</a> to doing that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if nuking the filibuster were realistically on the table and Democrats could codify Roe into law, there’s really nothing precluding Republicans from then reversing that if they take back control of the House and Senate later this year, right? As we already know, the midterm environment is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-2022-be-a-good-year-for-republicans-yes-we-know-its-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely to favor Republicans this year</a>, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> As Alex<strong> </strong>said, the continued existence of the filibuster means that it’s impossible to imagine federal legislation on abortion passing anytime soon. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if Democrats were to abolish the filibuster (unlikely), they might still not have the votes to codify abortion rights into law. As you mentioned, Sarah, the Senate voted on a bill to do just that as recently as February, and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00065.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it failed</a>. Manchin voted against it, but so did pro-choice Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. (However, Collins and Murkowski have <a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/02/collins-murkowski-introduce-alternative-senate-bill-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced similar legislation</a> that would not go as far as Democrats’, suggesting they are at least open to it.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>In theory, Democrats may have 49 votes (the party’s caucus minus Manchin), but at least for legislation written by Democrats, I doubt either Collins or Murkowski would want to provide the 50th vote to set up a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Kamala Harris. Murkowski <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is up for reelection</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/us/politics/lisa-murkowski-alaska.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has already made plenty of moves</a> that have ticked off the right, and like many politicians, Collins seems inclined to avoid <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/susan-collins-and-lisa-murkowski-get-the-cover-they-need-in-impeachment-2020-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being put in a situation</a> where <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1152/vote_115_2_00223.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her vote</a> is a <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/2020/10/27/sen-collins-says-vote-against-barrett-fair-american-people/3748484001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difference maker</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Well, and there’s always the possibility that the Supreme Court would overrule a federal law that protects abortion rights.<strong> </strong>Dare I say it, I ultimately think this isn’t going to be something that Democratic politicians feel a lot of pressure around until abortion rights are actually gone in half the country and people start to see what that means.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Totally agree, Amelia. But I also wonder if the potential midterm repercussions for Democrats (or fears around that) will motivate a few members to change their mind? For instance, maybe Collins changes <a href="https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-defends-filibuster-urges-colleagues-to-protect-this-critical-check-on-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her views on nuking the filibuster</a> now that Justice Brett Kavanaugh appears in favor of axing Roe?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I don’t know. The only scenario where I could see Democrats passing a pro-abortion bill is if, in 2023, they somehow hold the House and pick up seats in the Senate. If they win, say, 52 seats, the votes could be there to abolish the filibuster. But Democrats holding the House and picking up seats in the Senate is a pretty unlikely scenario.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the flip side, I think the soonest Republicans could enact a national abortion ban would be 2025: They’d have to flip not only the Senate and House but also the presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that scenario maybe seems more plausible given how favorable the Senate map is to Republicans, especially in 2024. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even then, though, they’d probably have to abolish the filibuster, which I think would be unlikely to happen. I don’t think Collins or Murkowski would vote to abolish the filibuster in a GOP-controlled Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> I don’t know, Nathaniel. If the GOP ends up with a large Senate majority after the 2024 election, they might be more inclined to get rid of the filibuster than a narrow Democratic majority currently is — especially if Democrats are blocking some major Republican goals in 2025. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a world where Republicans have, like, 57-58 seats — <a href="https://twitter.com/davidshor/status/1511028728381734912?s=20&amp;t=h_MW0CyVn0OlwrE3RJuJ8Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite feasible after 2024</a> — there may be a push to do something. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> But by the time we get to 2024, that’ll be two years without abortion access in half the country — which could have changed the politics quite a bit — so I’m not sure what this will mean at the federal level.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I do think, though, that in the immediate future we will see more state-level Democratic politicians leaning into abortion as an issue, since they have some power to change the status quo. And blue states have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-rights-havent-been-a-priority-in-blue-states-until-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lagged a lot</a> on expanding access to abortion; they’ve caught up to red states a bit in the past few years, but there’s still room for them to do more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Americans have a complicated relationship to abortion in that they support a number of different restrictions, some of which are out of step with Roe. But at the same time, most Americans do not want Roe overturned. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/upcoming-abortion-decision-supreme-court-could-rattle-midterm-campaigns-n1293949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from NBC News</a> was conducted earlier this year, but it found that voters, including independents, not only supported Roe but also weren’t in favor of candidates who wanted to overturn Roe.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the court were to overturn Roe this term, then doesn’t this have the potential to shake up the midterms in ways that we can’t really anticipate now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> There’s a myth that Americans are personally conflicted about abortion. But <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s not really true</a>. The vast majority of Americans think abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances — we’re talking 85-90 percent. So completely banning abortion would be highly unpopular.</p>

But I suspect that when confronted with the reality of a post-Roe country, that could change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Will it happen in time for the midterms, though? I’m not sure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> That’s a good point, Amelia. This <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC News/Washington Post poll</a> was conducted before Alito’s draft opinion was leaked, but I think it’s striking how unaware many people were when it came to the abortion landscape in their state. It found that in the 22 states that have passed abortion restrictions since 2020, only 30 percent of residents were aware of the restrictions. Forty-four percent said they weren’t aware, and 26 percent said they were unsure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I’m torn on the effects this will have on the midterms. On the one hand, some polling suggests that protecting abortion rights is a priority for Democrats in particular. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-reproductive-rights-bd86cf1c8ddbfd09c5e221c7a9d41e01?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a December poll from the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>, 13 percent of Democrats named abortion or reproductive rights as one of the issues they wanted Congress to address in 2022. And that’s a marked increase from two other times the poll asked the question: Less than 1 percent of Democrats called it a priority in 2021, and only 3 percent did in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it’s not immediately clear to me whether gutting Roe would hurt Republicans in the midterms. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup found in March</a>, for instance, that Americans do not consider abortion to be a critical problem facing the nation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> What’s tricky about this is that the people who are most in favor of abortion rights <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/march-2022-aps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are college-educated</a>, and while those people <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GIovkPfwUJvFZeFPdOi0fK8Rr7aOVFCYBzrlMG4Vjro/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have backed Democrats</a> in recent elections, they are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/pp_2020-06-02_party-id_2-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far from a majority</a> of the electorate. For abortion to make a big difference in the election, you’d need to see other groups of voters shifting back toward Democrats on this issue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And I’m skeptical abortion is going to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supplant the economy and inflation</a> as the top issues Americans are worried about — not when Biden’s approval rating will likely still be in the low 40s and <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/forecast/inflation-rate-signals-tighter-monetary-policy-and-threatens-soft-landing#:~:text=Still%2C%20inflation%20is%20expected%20to,as%20economic%20activity%20also%20slows." target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s little sign</a> that inflation is going to fully stabilize before the election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, Geoffrey, I’m not sure it will change many people’s actual votes; if you support abortion rights, you’re probably already voting Democratic. It could, however, increase Democratic enthusiasm to turn out in a year when Republicans might otherwise have an enthusiasm advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/politics/cnn-poll-abortion-roe-v-wade/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a CNN/SSRS poll from January</a>, 35 percent of Americans said they would be “angry” if the Supreme Court overturned Roe. And that group was disproportionately Democratic: 51 percent of Democrats said they would be angry (significantly more than the 29 percent of Republicans who said they would be “happy”). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, to put it simply, angry people vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> This is a topic that’s hard to poll because we genuinely don’t know what will happen. Many Americans have never lived in a country where abortion wasn’t legal. And the landscape of abortion access will look very different in 2022 than it did in 1972, because abortion pills provide a safe way to secretly terminate a pregnancy that wasn’t available back then.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> This is somewhat speculative, but it is possible that overturning Roe could energize <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2019/11/20/support-for-abortion-rights-is-increasing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">younger progressives</a> and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women</a>. I know both groups already lean Democratic, but maybe Democrats could use this to motivate groups that have soured somewhat on Biden since he became president?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> That’s a good point, Alex. This certainly could be a motivating issue for the Democratic base and could help them limit their losses in the midterm. The problem for Democrats, however, is that all <a href="https://insights.targetsmart.com/did-education-sway-the-va-election-maybe-but-probably-not.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the evidence</a> still points <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/31/enthusiasm-gap-dems-00021774" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to very high</a> GOP turnout for a midterm election. I think swing voters are unlikely to be heavily swayed by abortion as an issue, too; they’re <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/focus-group-report-soft-partisans-and-independents-on-inflation-and-the-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably going to be unhappy</a> with the current economic situation under a Democratic president, so that will <a href="https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3365&amp;context=facoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push many to vote Republican</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I just don’t see abortion changing those <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic midterm calculations</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Maybe, though, this has a bigger impact on state-level elections this year, like gubernatorial races, for the reasons we mentioned earlier. Simply put, those offices are actually in a position to do something about this.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> We do know from the 2018 midterms, however, that Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-kavanaugh-helping-republicans-midterm-chances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did likely affect the outcome, especially by helping Republicans in the Senate</a>, so if the court were to overturn Roe, it’s certainly possible that this would have an effect, too. As Amelia said earlier, it’s just really hard to know at this point because we still don’t know how the court will ultimately rule.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve talked about this a little already, but to conclude, let’s take a step back and more broadly talk about where Americans stand on abortion. If the court were to overturn Roe, this would be <em>really</em> out of step with public opinion. What are the potential consequences of this, especially as it pertains to the legitimacy of the court?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> In the past, the Supreme Court has been responsive to public opinion. In the 1970s, for instance, they <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/29/supreme-court-strikes-down-death-penalty-june-29-1972-239938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down the death penalty</a>, only to <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1975/74-6257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow states to use it again</a> after <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/11/16/the-odds-of-overturning-the-death-penalty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a backlash</a>. But we’re in uncharted territory with this extremely conservative court. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The court seems to know this, too. For instance, in Alito’s draft opinion, he said that the justices shouldn’t let external considerations like public opinion or political backlash sway them. So it’s clear that they’re aware this would not be a universally welcomed move.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> The court’s favorability has already slipped, too. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/02/02/publics-views-of-supreme-court-turned-more-negative-before-news-of-breyers-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a January survey by the Pew Research Center</a>, just a little over half of U.S. adults (54 percent) had a favorite opinion of the high court, compared with 44 percent who viewed it unfavorably. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On its face, those numbers might not look too bad, but the share of adults with a favorable view of the court has declined significantly since August 2019. Back then, 69 percent of adults had a favorable view of the court, and only 30 percent had an unfavorable view.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>The justices don’t really have a reason to care about their favorability numbers, though. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-can-stop-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s no way</a> for voters to directly hold the justices accountable for their actions. Congress <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/is-it-time-to-expand-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could add more justices to the court</a>, but that’s not going to happen anytime soon. So they don’t have much of an incentive to pull their punches right now — especially considering that overturning Roe has been <a href="https://scholarship.law.edu/scholar/1058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a primary goal of the conservative legal movement</a> for decades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett were put on the court to do this very thing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Right, Amelia. On the one hand, we shouldn’t be surprised that many of the conservative justices want to overturn Roe, since this <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-2016-pro-life-judges-60-minutes-2020-09-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was a big criteria</a> former President Donald Trump used to select nominees to the high court.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, I’ve been wrestling with the weird contradiction that this (potential) decision is both jaw-dropping and completely unsurprising.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Roberts is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roe-v-wade-supreme-court-leaked-draft-opinion-john-roberts-betrayal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clearly upset about the leak</a> — he called it a “betrayal” and apparently has asked the marshal of the court to investigate how it happened — but this just seems like a confirmation of what we already knew: This is a very conservative court that is increasingly out of step with mainstream public opinion, and there’s no real mechanism to change that.</p>]]></description>
