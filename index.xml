<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">A fresh wave of COVID-19 cases <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/04/09/gridiron-covid-pelosi-bowser-garland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swept through the U.S. Capitol last week</a>, affecting a number of officials at <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/07/1066212755/speaker-nancy-pelosi-has-tested-positive-for-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest levels of government</a> just as President Biden’s administration <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/bidens-return-normal-covid-strategy-faces-new-test-funding-stalls-rcna20522" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urges for a return to normalcy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just Capitol Hill that’s seeing a fresh round of COVID-19 infections. The <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant</a> has led to an <a href="https://turnto10.com/news/coronavirus/stealth-omicron-ba2-variant-rhode-island-department-health-new-england-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uptick in new cases across the Northeast</a>. The New York Times’s tracker shows that cases for New York City <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-city-new-york-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have risen by over 60 percent</a>, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/washington-district-of-columbia-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cases rising over 140 percent</a> in Washington, D.C., over the same period. But according to recent polling, a majority of Americans are still ready to put the pandemic behind them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Per the latest <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index</a>, the number of Americans partaking in activities outside of their homes is on the rise. As of April 8-11, 65 percent of respondents reported going out to eat recently, while another 66 percent said they’ve visited with friends or family. That’s a sharp uptick from January, the survey noted, when only 46 percent and 50 percent of Americans, respectively, said the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, a dwindling number of people are in favor of taking precautionary measures to prevent the virus’s spread. The poll found that only 36 percent of respondents wanted businesses to require customers to prove that they’ve been vaccinated — down 15 percentage points from when the question was first asked in February. Part of these changing attitudes could be driven by the fact that Americans are increasingly likely to say that the worst of the pandemic is behind us: A separate <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/04/04/concerns-about-covid-19-pandemic-and-measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov</a> poll found that, as of late March, only 11 percent of survey respondents believed the pandemic would get worse, compared to 31 percent who felt the same at the start of January. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s still a lot we don’t know about this, but at this point Americans don’t seem to be worrying about it as much as they did the delta wave that rocked the nation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/health/delta-variant-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last summer</a> or last fall and winter’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omicron wave</a>. In mid-September, as cases rose nationwide, a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/views-on-the-pandemic/#section-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult tracking survey</a> found that one-third (33 percent) of adults saw COVID-19 as a “severe” health risk to their community. As of earlier this week, that number sat at just 15 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for preventative measures like vaccine requirements, especially in the workplace, has decreased, too. According to a March poll from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/31/americans-skeptical-about-religious-objections-to-covid-19-vaccines-but-oppose-employer-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, only 29 percent of U.S. adults said employers should require their employees to get a vaccine. A majority of respondents (44 percent) said vaccines should be encouraged instead. Last July and August though, per <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354983/majority-supports-biden-covid-vaccine-mandates.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a>, support for these measures was much higher, with 52 percent of U.S. adults saying they were in favor of employee vaccine requirements, versus 38 percent who said they were opposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some ways, the fact that fewer Americans are concerned about contracting COVID-19 shouldn’t be <em>too</em> surprising. As FiveThirtyEight’s Jean Yi <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-isnt-going-anywhere-and-americans-know-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted in February</a>, Americans seem to be increasingly accepting of the fact that COVID-19 <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/how-we-live-coronavirus-forever/619783/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be here for good</a>. And while there’s still a lot we don’t know about BA.2, it’s also possible that this subvariant just won’t be <a href="https://consumer.healthday.com/3-23-does-omicron-ba-2-signal-another-covid-surge-for-americans-2657003626.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as deadly</a> as previous waves, and therefore, Americans are simply thinking about the virus differently. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pandemic fatigue might be an additional factor. As the chart below illustrates, how Americans are thinking about COVID-19 hasn’t changed much from March to April according to the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index. In both months, 30 percent of respondents said they were in favor of getting back to “life as usual” with zero COVID-19 mandates or requirements in place. But that is pretty different from how respondents were looking at the virus just a few months earlier: At the start of February, less than a quarter of respondents (21 percent) said the same. American’s perceptions of mask mandates have also changed drastically since then. About two months ago, 21 percent of adults said in the same survey that we should <em>increase </em>mask mandates and vaccine precautions, versus a mere 6 percent who felt the same way in April.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title='More people want to get back to "life as usual"' aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u0PZO/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="338" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Of course, despite polling that suggests Americans may be adopting more lax attitudes toward the pandemic, global health experts continue to warn that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/covid-19-pandemic-is-far-over-who-official-2022-03-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 is far from gone</a>. In fact, it’s possible that, in the coming weeks, the nation could see another surge in infections driven by BA.2. But whether that will change people’s attitudes toward COVID-19 precautions seems to remain an open question.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Americans are feeling the economic fallout of higher gas prices, and changing their behavior in response. Half of Americans reported that <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/April-2022-ABC-news-poll">the increased prices had caused some degree of financial hardship</a>, according to an April 8-9 poll from ABC News/Ipsos. A Morning Consult poll from March 17-20 found that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/13/gas-price-pain-curbing-mobility/">31 percent of adults purchased less gas</a> in March than they had in the previous month. When Morning Consult asked whether they had used other forms of transportation in a March 18-21 poll, 44 percent said they walked, 18 percent biked, 15 percent used public transport and 7 percent used an electric bike or scooter. That said, a plurality of Americans (47 percent) still told Morning Consult that they supported sanctioning Russian oil and natural gas exports, even if that led to higher prices, according to a poll conducted April 2-4.</li><li>The state of the economy is clearly top of mind for most Americans, as <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-inflation-outweighs-jobs-on-economic-views-prices-force-cutbacks/">76 percent said that the economy should be a high priority</a> for the country to address in an April 5-8 poll from CBS News/YouGov. Seventy-three percent said the same about inflation, which far outweighs concern for the other issues asked about. Other high-priority issues included crime (59 percent) and the “situation” between Russia and Ukraine (58 percent), but all the other issues asked about, immigration, climate change and COVID-19, polled below 50 percent. But Americans aren’t feeling all bad on the economic front. They had a brighter outlook on job availability — 56 percent said their local job market was good, and 51 percent said that the number of jobs in the U.S. overall increased over the last year.</li><li>According to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/04/12/opinions-laws-limiting-teaching-sexuality-gender">an April 5-8 YouGov poll</a>, American adults are divided on the provisions in Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law, which some critics have termed “Don’t Say Gay,” because it would limit discussions of gender and sexual orientation in kindergarden through third grade classrooms. Forty-four percent said they supported banning public school teachers from providing instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity to students in kindergarten through third grade, while 41 percent opposed it. Meanwhile, 47 percent said they supported allowing parents to sue school districts if they believed classroom instruction on these topics was not age-appropriate according to state standards, while 38 percent opposed it.</li><li>When it comes to social media companies and users under 18, many Americans think more protections should be in place, according to two April 13 polls from YouGov. Sixty percent of respondents felt that social media companies <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/04/13/2dfd8/3">shouldn’t be allowed</a> to make content recommendations to underage users, and 72 percent didn’t want those companies <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/04/13/2dfd8/2">collecting data on those users</a>. Forty-seven percent even said in a third poll that people under 18 <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/04/13/2dfd8/1">shouldn’t be able to</a> create their own social media accounts at all.</li><li>There’s currently widespread support for a number of climate change policy proposals that would limit greenhouse gas emissions, according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391679/climate-change-proposals-favored-solid-majorities.aspx">March 1-18 poll from Gallup</a>. Large majorities back all six of the proposals asked about — 61 percent favor providing tax credits for those who buy electric vehicles, 62 percent favor establishing stricter limits on methane emissions when producing natural gas, 71 percent favor higher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, 75 percent favor tax incentives for businesses that use renewable energy, and 89 percent favor providing tax credits for individuals who install at-home renewable energy systems like solar panels. Even the least popular proposal asked about, increasing federal funding for electric vehicle charging stations, had 59 percent of respondents in favor of it.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential approval tracker</a>, 41.5 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 52.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -10.7 points). At this time <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/emmanuel-macron-could-lose-frances-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, 41.7 percent approved and 52.6 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -11.0 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 42.9 percent and a disapproval rating of 51.9 percent, for a net approval rating of -9.1 points.</p>



<h2><strong>Generic ballot</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In our average of polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a>, Republicans currently lead by 2.2 percentage points (44.7 percent to 42.9 percent). A week ago, Republicans led Democrats by 2.2 points (44.7 percent to 42.5 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Republicans by 2.2 points (44.8 percent to 42.6 percent).</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nine months after the 2020 election, the call came in. The Colorado secretary of state’s office was on the phone and wanted to know why the passwords for Mesa County’s election equipment were on the internet for anyone to see. But the powers that be in Mesa County didn’t even know the passwords had leaked. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re saying, ‘What are you talking about?’” recalled Mesa County Commissioner Scott McInnis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Images of screens displaying the passwords had been shared a few days earlier on the chat app Telegram by a QAnon leader. The Colorado secretary of state launched an investigation and issued an order for Tina Peters, the county clerk, to let them inspect the equipment and try to get to the bottom of what happened. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there was a problem. Peters wasn’t in Mesa County. She was on her way to South Dakota for a “Cyber Symposium” hosted by Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow and one of the most prominent peddlers of the Big Lie. Data from Mesa County election equipment hard drives were later displayed at the symposium. The man talking about them was that same QAnon leader — Ron Watkins — the former administrator of the message board where Q, the shadowy figure behind the QAnon conspiracy movement, posted the bulk of their posts. Watkins is so deeply entangled with QAnon that many experts believe he may have been Q himself.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These days, Peters is back in Mesa County. She has to be. She can’t leave the state after being <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/03/09/mesa-clerk-tina-peters-charged-by-grand-jury-in-election-security-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently indicted</a> by a grand jury on 10 counts, including seven felony charges, for allegedly using a false identity and lying to state employees while allowing an unauthorized individual to make copies of the election equipment hard drive. When I visited last month, I found her at the Hilton DoubleTree in Grand Junction — the county seat — where she was attending the county GOP Assembly to campaign for her spot on the primary ballot. She’s now running for secretary of state. There, sitting on a patio with her bright white bob sparkling in the sun, she told me that her decision to copy the election equipment hard drives was not only allowed but required. And she believes those copies have revealed serious vulnerabilities in the county’s election equipment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If I want somebody to come in and preserve my election records, that is my role, and that is my duty,” Peters said. “That’s what I did.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the way she chose to go about “preserving” those records has wrought havoc on Mesa County and on Peters herself. Addressing the fallout of her actions, including having to replace election equipment deemed compromised by the state, has cost more than $1 million of tax-payer money, according to McInnis. Her actions also led to the indictment charges, for which she faces up to 28 years in jail and $2.7 million in fines, with the potential for more charges coming. And it has sown further mistrust in the election system among voters, all while failing to unearth any actual evidence of election fraud. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters’s story is wild. It begins with an after-hours backup of the hard drives straight out of a heist movie and also includes switched-off security cameras, the MyPillow guy and Peters <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/arrest-video-shows-mesa-county-elections-clerks-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donkey-kicking a cop in a bagel shop</a> (when I spoke with Peters, she got out of her seat to demonstrate how it was accidental). It’s a singular sequence of events. But it may also be a preview of what’s to come for other communities across the country. It’s a cautionary tale of what happens when those charged with overseeing our elections believe in the Big Lie. And with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democracy-is-on-the-ballot-in-these-11-secretary-of-state-and-attorney-general-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scores</a> of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/backers-trumps-false-fraud-claims-seek-control-next-us-elections-2021-09-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Lie-believing</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-jan-6-election-lie/2022/01/05/82f4cad4-6cb6-11ec-974b-d1c6de8b26b0_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates</a> seeking offices large and small this year, there’s a chance your community could become the next Mesa County.</p>

Law enforcement has questions about just who copied the election records, alleging that Peters lied about who helped her. <p>Hart Van Denburg / Colorado Public Radio via AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">There are likely hundreds of would-be Tina Peterses all across the country — candidates running for elected office in the midterm elections who believe, to varying extents, that the 2020 election was rife with fraud, despite all their evidence being categorically debunked. In Texas alone, 43 Big Lie-endorsing candidates have run in the state’s congressional and gubernatorial races thus far. Election fraud believers are also running for less high-profile jobs that would give them influence over elections: secretary of state, attorney general and, yes, county clerk. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Getting such candidates elected to these positions is an explicitly stated goal of some of the biggest promoters of the Big Lie. Steve Bannon, the former Donald Trump strategist whose podcast played a key role in spreading the election fraud theory (and who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/trump-aide-steve-bannon-trial-set-for-jan-6-capitol-riot-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">himself was indicted</a> on charges of contempt of Congress for refusing to testify to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol), has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/steve-bannon-donald-trump-michael-flynn-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted these candidates on his podcast</a> and stressed the importance of voting for his anointed picks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re taking this back village by village,” Bannon said <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/bannons-war-room-1011321/episodes/episode-1003-run-toward-troubl-92687807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on an episode last summer</a>. “Where the energy is, is taking these school boards back. Where the energy is, is precinct committeemen, people signing up to throw out the GOP establishment.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters, for her part, wasn’t always a voter fraud conspiracist. When she was elected in 2018, there was little talk of elections. Her main platform point was a pledge to reopen two DMV offices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[The race] was solely focused on motor vehicles more than it was elections,” said Bobbie Gross, Peters’s opponent in the GOP primary that year and one of the candidates running to replace Peters as county clerk this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even directly following the 2020 election, Peters told me she trusted everything had gone smoothly. When people started coming to her with questions and allegations of fraud, she said she didn’t think there was anything to them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I said, ‘You know what? Bring me what you have, we’ll check it out,’” Peters said. “Now, in my mind, I’m thinking we’ll just debunk it and we’ll explain how that can’t be possible.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But something started to erode Peters’s prior belief that the county’s elections were secure. As early as January 2021, Peters <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/peters-tweets-conspiracy-theory-over-election-system/article_3a73d404-4ec5-11eb-9597-1b5e0fdc20da.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted election fraud conspiracies</a> from a personal account, claiming that it’s possible to “tabulate ballots more than once favoring a candidate” and to “change algorithm in a voting machine.” Then in April, when the most staunchly conservative candidates in the Grand Junction City Council race did not win, Peters was surprised. “When I pulled the tallies at 7 p.m. for the municipal election, I was shocked. I was shocked,” Peters said. “I went, ‘There’s no way.’” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, election surprises happen all the time. While Mesa County as a whole is comfortably red, Grand Junction itself has grown more moderate over the past few years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even leaning blue</a> in some neighborhoods. The candidates who won also largely had more experience with local government, and many sources with knowledge of Mesa County politics told me there was nothing surprising about the results of the race. </p>

But since then, she has become a vocal proponent for debunked election fraud conspiracies. <p>McKenzie Lange / The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel via AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Two weeks after the city council election, Peters <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/an-elections-supervisor-embraced-conspiracy-theories-officials-say-she-has-become-an-insider-threat/2021/09/26/ee60812e-1a17-11ec-a99a-5fea2b2da34b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requested her staff attend</a> a presentation by Douglas Frank, a high school math teacher from Ohio who was touring the country making claims of election fraud. It was around this time that the secretary of state’s office informed county clerks that they were planning to conduct what’s called a “trusted build,” a secure but routine in-person update of the software on all election equipment in the state that takes place in a lull between elections. The update requires the presence of employees from the secretary of state’s office, the local county clerk’s offices and Dominion — the manufacturer of the voting machines for most counties in Colorado, including Mesa County. As part of the preparations, every county was required to back up all election data prior to the update to make sure no important information was lost. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters was making her own preparations. On May 17, eight days before the update was to occur, Peters’s deputy clerk, Belinda Knisley, requested that the security cameras in the election offices be turned off. While legal,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/rule_making/CurrentRules/8CCR1505-1/Rule20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;By law&lt;/a&gt;, the security cameras are only required to be on for 60 days prior to an election and 30 days following, and this time period did not fall into that window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> multiple sources told me the cameras were not typically turned off.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters has been forthcoming about the fact that she made backups of the election equipment hard drive. She also confirmed that she had the security cameras turned off. But she’s less open to speaking about precisely how it all went down from there. When asked if anyone helped her make the backups, she told me: “I don’t want to really talk about that, because that’s under investigation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The indictment against Peters alleges that the Sunday before the update was to take place, three security badges were used while accessing secured election offices. One of those badges belonged to Peters, another to an elections manager <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/brown-fired-from-clerks-office/article_d9127c14-4271-11ec-920f-930f0c507553.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who would later be fired</a>, and the last to a man named Gerald Wood, who had only been hired as a temp worker the week before and who says he wasn’t there that day. Then, on the day of the update, employees of the secretary of state’s office and Dominion testified that Peters introduced a clerk’s office employee as Gerald Wood. But, again, Wood said he wasn’t there that day and provided an alibi to back it up. Peters has been charged with, among other things, identity theft and criminal impersonation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s almost like a miniature Watergate,” said McInnis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I emailed Peters a detailed list of follow-up questions about these specific allegations in the indictment, but she did not provide a response prior to publication. </p>

Watkins did not respond to questions sent to him via his lawyer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The leak prompted the secretary of state’s office to begin an investigation, which revealed the ballot tabulation machines had been compromised and needed to be decertified and replaced at the county’s expense. The secretary of state also <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2021/08/30/colorado-jena-griswold-tina-peters-mesa-county-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a petition</a> to have a judge strip Peters and Knisley of their authority to oversee the November 2021 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m happy to walk through what an election record is and what it isn’t. But lying to my office, allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment, leaking sensitive passwords that control the motherboard of the entire voting equipment and compromising voting equipment is not allowed,” said Jena Griswold, Colorado’s secretary of state, in an interview. “That creates a security risk.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters, meanwhile, maintains that it was perfectly legal for her to make copies of the hard drive and that her actions have helped reveal vulnerabilities in the election system. The hard drive copies were analyzed by two people with connections to Lindell, a software developer and a former cybersecurity strategist. They put together <a href="https://www.tinapetersforcolorado.com/election-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of reports</a> alleging the update had led to the deletion of important election records, and revealed security weaknesses in the ballot tabulation machines. The reports have been <a href="https://www.nbc11news.com/2021/09/25/elections-expert-sec-state-respond-allegations-election-system-data-destruction-insecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> by <a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/2021/11/example-forensicating-mesa-county.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experts</a> who say they fail to actually show what they allege. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What the reports <em>do</em> show is that there can be a security risk to the ballot tabulation machines, but only if someone has physical access to the machines — which are only accessible to authorized individuals who have undergone background checks and have access to the locked area where the machines are located, <em>and</em> who have access to the passwords — as Peters is alleged to have allowed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In general, it’s nearly impossible to make a modern Windows computer secure against somebody who has physical access to the machine,” Robert Graham, a cybersecurity expert who had reviewed Peters’s reports, said in an email.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the leak, the Mesa County district attorney began an investigation into the alleged security breach, as did federal investigators with the FBI, who <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/ag-to-tina-peters-no-your-door-was-not-batted-down/article_ba0196ec-47fe-11ec-af9f-8fae38ede34f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later raided the homes</a> of Peters, Wood and two other individuals. This January, <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/01/13/grand-jury-will-weigh-possible-charges-in-mesa-clerk-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a grand jury was tasked</a> with considering the findings of the DA’s investigation. Peters announced she was running for secretary of state the following month, but in March, the grand jury indicted Peters on 10 counts, including criminal impersonation, attempt to influence a public servant, and identity theft. If found guilty of all charges, Peters <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/peters-knisley-surrender-to-law-enforcement-after-indictments/article_98db6796-9fe6-11ec-a814-bfc1b13c4c21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be sentenced</a> to up to 28 years in jail and face $2.7 million in fines. She has no plans to suspend her secretary of state campaign. </p>

The only other person who garnered such widespread support was Rep. Lauren Boebert, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/boebert-capitol-guns/2021/01/04/a59f70f8-4e9d-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gun-toting, pro-Trump</a> freshman member whose district includes Mesa County. (Boebert declined to speak with me for this story but had previously <a href="https://boebert.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-lauren-boeberts-statement-fbi-investigation-mesa-county-clerk-tina-peters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a statement</a> supporting the district attorney’s investigation.) In the world of Big Lie believers and the far right, Peters has become one of a small cast of folk heroes. And while she’s the one facing criminal charges, the biggest names in the Big Lie circuit, such as Lindell and Bannon, are more than happy to use her story to further their own ambitions. Following the symposium, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyvjwa/mike-lindell-is-hiding-an-alleged-election-data-leaker-as-fbi-open-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peters went into hiding</a> for a month with Lindell’s help and did not <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/clerk-peters-returns-to-grand-junction-vows-to-fight/article_5f3bb9b2-1753-11ec-b5c1-1b6804deafa0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return to Mesa County</a> until mid-September. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the county commissioners have done their best to clean up the mess on their hands. To try to restore trust in the election process ahead of an election last fall, the commissioners implemented additional verification measures: They hired Clear Ballot, another certified election equipment vendor and Dominion’s chief competitor, to re-count all the ballots that were run through the Dominion machines. And then they did a hand count. Neither count showed major discrepancies — the Dominion counts were accurate. The commissioners are also in the process of anonymizing all ballots in order to upload them online so that voters can verify the vote totals themselves. They’re even planning to refurbish the room where election equipment is stored to have bigger windows and allow election-watchers a better view of the counting process, according to McInnis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This thing has cost this little county at least $1 million. It’s going to be $1 million-plus, and we haven’t turned up one fraudulent vote. Not one,” McInnis said. The bulk of the cost came from replacing the equipment, implementing the additional safeguards, personnel, and diverting resources from other departments, according to McInnis. For context, that represents roughly a third of the county clerk’s office’s <a href="https://www.mesacounty.us/globalassets/finance/budgets/2022/2022-adopted-budget/adopted-budget.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire annual budget</a> for 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet none of those efforts have swayed Peters or her followers, who are still suspicious of the election equipment in Mesa County, despite the fact that Trump won the county in 2020 by 28 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“To my chagrin, it has not appeased hardly anybody,” said Cody Davis, another county commissioner.</p>

Two individuals who refused to give me their names told me Peters is a “hero.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“My gut tells me, ‘Why would anybody in their right mind put themselves through what she’s put herself through just to put herself through it?’” said Melissa Anchondo, who was attending the assembly. “I think she’s innocent. I think she’s great. I hope people can start to realize what’s going on.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There’s an awful lot of questions, and I think if you ask most of the people here I’ll bet most would say they don’t believe the election was fair,” said David Dearborn, a delegate at the assembly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the delegates who refused to give me her name said, “She is a hero and she’ll go down in Colorado history as being a hero for all the voters against the corruption of Dominion voting machines.”</p>



<hr><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1368" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1229002388-1024.jpg" alt="Supporters hold a Trump sign prior to a campaign rally for Lauren Boebert in Colorado" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1229002388-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1229002388-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1229002388-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Mesa County is in the congressional district that elected Lauren Boebert, one of the most conservative and conspiratorially minded members of Congress. <p>JASON CONNOLLY / AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Kevin McCarney is possibly the most Republican man I have ever met. In the course of our one-hour conversation, most of which was focused on Peters, McCarney managed to get in comments about his belief in the Second Amendment, his anti-abortion views, and make a dig at soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. As chair of the GOP in Mesa County, a county that hasn’t elected a Democrat since 1964, McCarney said he has sometimes been accused of being “too conservative.” But even he has been frustrated by what Peters did. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don’t like being a babysitter, and that’s what I’ve been the last six months because of the Tina situation,” McCarney said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a lot of Republicans in Mesa County — this is, after all, the region of the country that elected Boebert, one of the most conservative and bombastic members of Congress. Nearly every elected official I spoke to for this story, including the county commissioners, the candidate running to replace Peters as clerk, and the county treasurer (who was tasked with helping run last year’s election after Peters was stripped of her duties) was a Republican. All of these stalwart supporters of the GOP have been forced to reckon with the outcome of her actions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a place like this, the Republican primary for many positions is essentially the general election. That was the case in 2018, when Peters, then a local businesswoman, <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/tina-peters-wins-clerks-spot-defeats-office-veteran/article_bf9bc82c-79c9-11e8-9cb6-10604b9f6eda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beat out Gross</a>, a 10-year veteran of the clerk’s office, to win the GOP nomination for county clerk, securing the job. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Her first year in office was relatively uncontroversial, but in 2020, after 574 uncounted ballots were discovered in a drop box for an election the previous fall, a recall effort against Peters was launched. The recall effort — backed by several former employees of the clerk’s office, which had seen three-quarters of its staff resign under Peters — failed to get enough signatures to prompt a vote, but the Colorado secretary of state did order an election observer to report on the clerk’s office. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of Peters’s GOP colleagues forgave her for that incident, telling me “mistakes happen.” But they weren’t as forgiving of the alleged decision to allow an unauthorized person to essentially hack the voting system. McCarney said it has caused tension among Republicans, between those who support Peters and believe there was fraud and those who don’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We have a division where we shouldn’t have division right now,” McCarney said. “I don’t care if you hate one another, we’re Republicans and we need to band together in this election. There are people here who have drunk the Kool-Aid, as I say, and their hatred is palpable toward anybody who disagrees with them.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP21336123166790-711.jpg" alt="The crowd at a rally in support of Tina Peters" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP21336123166790-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP21336123166790-711.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP21336123166790-711.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Many conservatives see Peters as a public official trying to expose election misconduct — misconduct for which there is no evidence. <p>McKenzie Lange / The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel via AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s also forced Republican representatives to bear heavy critiques from their own team. Davis, the Mesa County commissioner, told me his voicemail was full of messages from angry voters. He suspects that most of them, the most threatening ones, come from people out of state, as they came in after his contact information was shared publicly by Lindell and because the individuals who have come out to voice their frustration in person have largely been polite. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This is what I signed up for,” Davis said. “I enjoy engaging with people. When I can get people to a room or a coffee table, I can actually have a good rational conversation with people. It’s the people who won’t return my phone calls, who don’t want to listen to me, who just email me. They’re interested in a narrative, not in the truth.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Mesa County is not made up exclusively of Big Lie believers, and elected officials have received plenty of criticism from constituents who think the efforts taken to appease those who believe there was voter fraud are a waste of time and money. McInnis showed me an anonymous letter calling him “a disgrace and an embarrassment” for not removing Peters from office. (As an elected official, Peters cannot be removed from office by the county commissioners.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The turmoil Peters’s actions have caused for her fellow partisans demonstrates why Republicans, too, ought to be wary of the potential for a wave of election truthers being elected to office this fall. While it may initially appease the base, having an elected official who believes in the Big Lie can easily go south, helping those who stand to profit from the ongoing erosion of electoral trust. Having someone “on the inside” provides profiteers like Bannon an opportunity for access and a source for red meat to throw to their audience. For everyone else, including Republicans, it’s a disaster.</p>



<hr><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1239771761-1024.jpg" alt="Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1239771761-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1239771761-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1239771761-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Hyoung Chang / MediaNews Group / The Denver Post via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">There are still some questions left unanswered in the Tina Peters story. One of the bigger ones is who exactly helped her make the copy of the hard drive. If the man using the identity of Gerald Wood was in fact not Wood, who was he? There are <a href="https://twitter.com/get_innocuous/status/1425901516225859588" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some theories that have been floated</a>, but as of right now we can’t say conclusively. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another pressing question is what will happen to Peters herself. For now, she’s awaiting trial for the charges laid against her and may face more charges out of the federal investigation. She’s currently facing another court challenge from the secretary of state to remove her from overseeing another election — this time the 2022 midterms. She was given a contempt of court citation for allegedly recording a hearing in a case against her deputy clerk. And when police tracked her down in a local bagel shop to execute a search warrant for that iPad, she allegedly resisted, leading to her being placed in handcuffs and donkey-kicking a cop — so she also faces charges for obstruction of a peace officer. And then there are the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/11/16/tina-peters-mesa-county-elections-ethics-complaint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple ethics complaints</a> filed against her for raising money to cover legal fees and accepting gifts in the form of travel and housing from Lindell. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters is still running for secretary of state. And last weekend, she attended the state Republican Assembly, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-michael-bennet-colorado-colorado-springs-donald-trump-05ea9af16f9e8cb7e70761f4f02ddb3a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receiving 61 percent of the votes</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Big Lie proponents are currently running for secretary of state, governor and Congress. They’re running for school boards, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/heeding-steve-bannons-call-election-deniers-organize-to-seize-control-of-the-gop-and-reshape-americas-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election boards</a> and county clerks. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/us/politics/2020-election-voting-officials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veteran election officials</a> have been resigning in droves thanks to the death threats and intimidation lobbed at them by those who believe they were complicit in a stolen election. Peters’s story is unique, but it might not be for long. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Americans aren’t happy with the economy and it’s perhaps no wonder why when you look at the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest inflation numbers</a> out this week. Prices have risen 8.5 percent since last March, and wages haven’t kept pace, rising 6 percent in the past year. Economists are debating whether there are silver linings in March’s inflation numbers, but regardless 8.5 percent inflation is the highest rate in four decades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans have taken note. According to Gallup, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391220/inflation-dominates-americans-economic-concerns-march.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 percent</a> of Americans say the high cost of living is the most important issue facing the country – the most since 1985. In the University of Michigan <a href="https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/fetchdoc.php?docid=69606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Survey of Consumers</a>, more households reported they expected worsening finances over the coming year than at any point in the history of the survey, which began in the 1940s. And only <a href="https://www.pollingreport.com/biden_adm.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30-35 percent</a> of Americans approve of President Biden’s handling of the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, Galen Druke speaks with George Washington University economist <a href="https://economics.columbian.gwu.edu/tara-m-sinclair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara Sinclair</a> about the Americans’ pessimistic assessment of the economy.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When people talk about <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes in work and office culture</a> brought on by the pandemic — whether it’s returning to the office, working from home or a combination of remote and in-person work — they often overlook one very important group: people who were never able to work from home in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are many reasons why some people continued to report to in-person jobs throughout the pandemic, and we’re interested in talking to people — particularly women — who were unable to work from home for at least some or all of the pandemic. We’d like to speak to you if you had or have the kind of job that requires in-person interactions, like in food service, retail or health care, or if you had or have the kind of job that may have been possible to do remotely but for whatever reason you were unable to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’d like to know how you handled it, how it affected your work and home life, why you weren’t able to work from home and how it’s changed your relationship with work going forward. We’d also like to know whether being unable to work from home made a difference in your decision to continue working, leave the workforce or search for a new job. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Grooming” has become the most recent scare tactic of choice for the right. Fox News host Laura Ingraham <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/laura-ingraham/fox-news-chyron-liberals-are-sexually-grooming-elementary-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included a segment on her show last month</a> where she claimed public schools have become “grooming centers” where “sexual brainwashing” takes place. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1511830318365515778" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently tweeted</a> that the Democrats are the party of “grooming and transitioning children.” Last week, One America News host Chanel Rion <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/one-america-news-network/oan-host-biden-groomer-chief" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even called President Joe Biden</a> “the groomer-in-chief.” </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What kind of people would oppose grooming laws</p>— Jack Posobiec <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸"> (@JackPosobiec) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1511800494196342785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2022</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">For the unfamiliar, “grooming” is a term typically reserved to describe the type of behavior that child sexual abusers use to <a href="https://www.rainn.org/news/grooming-know-warning-signs#:~:text=One%20tool%20common%20to%20those,the%20risk%20of%20being%20caught." target="_blank" rel="noopener">coerce potential victims without being caught</a>. But now some Republicans are using it against any Democrat (<a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/walt-disney-groomer-children-lgbt-florida-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or company</a>)<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives have suggested that Disney’s opposition to Florida’s law restricting when kids learn about sexual orientation shows that the company supports groomers. FiveThirtyEight is owned by Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> who disagrees with them on certain policy issues. This is a deliberate tactic that was <a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1432808372324089856?s=20&amp;t=5H3o2PGieazxd8PfMBdCYg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted as early as last summer</a> by Christopher Rufo, the same conservative activist who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/06/19/critical-race-theory-rufo-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped muddle the language</a> around critical race theory. “Grooming” is a term that neatly draws together both modern conspiracy theories and old homophobic stereotypes, while comfortably shielding itself under the guise of protecting children. Who, after all, can argue against the safety of kids? But by adopting this language to bolster their latest political pursuits, the right is both giving a nod to fringe conspiracy theorists and using an age-old tactic to dismantle LGBTQ rights. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There is no better moral panic than a moral panic centered on potential harm to children,” said Emily Johnson, a history professor at Ball State University who specializes in U.S. histories of gender and sexuality. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This most recent round of high-profile “grooming” warnings seems to have started in early March, as Democrats attacked Florida’s law limiting what can be taught in schools. Republican defenders turned to “grooming” as a way to push back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The bill that liberals inaccurately call ‘Don’t Say Gay’ would be more accurately described as an Anti-Grooming Bill,” Christina Pushaw, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s press secretary, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1499886619259777029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted on March 4</a>. “If you’re against the Anti-Grooming Bill, you are probably a groomer or at least you don’t denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Except there’s no mention of grooming in the law. Instead, <a href="http://laws.flrules.org/2022/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it prohibits</a> “classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity” in kindergarten through third grade, “or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So if casting those who oppose this law as “pro-grooming” is not rooted in evidence, what is it rooted in? In part, it’s a dog whistle to the party’s most extreme, conspiracy-minded base. The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/qanons-obsession-with-savethechildren-is-making-it-harder-to-save-kids-from-traffickers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foundation</a> of the QAnon conspiracy theory is that there is a mass, secret, underground ring of Satanic pedophiles whose members consist of Democratic leaders and Hollywood elites. Painting anyone who opposes Florida’s law (i.e., mainly Democrats) as being pro-grooming fits neatly into that narrative and winks at QAnon adherents without requiring politicians on the right to actually endorse the outlandish theory. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this rhetoric also harkens back to age-old attacks on the LGBTQ community. Casting LGBTQ people as child predators and their very existence as something inherently sexual was a tactic used by anti-LGBTQ activists since the 1970s in their efforts to stifle or roll back LGBTQ legal protections, according to Marie-Amélie George, a law professor at Wake Forest University who specializes in LGBTQ rights. George said that for a long time, many people believed that being gay was the result of child sexual abuse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The religious right really modernized and repackaged that claim in the late ’70s and early ’80s to be that ‘gays and lesbians cannot reproduce, so they have to recruit,’” George said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not the ’80s anymore. Over the past few decades, Americans’ understanding and acceptance of the LGBTQ community has increased. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/258065/gallup-first-polled-gay-issues-changed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of Gallup polls</a> captures this evolution: In 1977, just 13 percent of Americans believed that “[b]eing gay or lesbian is something a person is born with,” but by 2019, 49 percent of Americans did. As this social shift happened and the LGBTQ community achieved more rights, it made the “child predator” narrative less effective. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why, then, is it back? George suspects the reason we’re seeing it come up again is due to the most recent frontier of LGBTQ rights: trans rights. “The reason it’s gaining more resonance now is, in part, because people understand trans identity much less clearly,” George said. “There’s a misunderstanding that people are electing a different gender identity as opposed to coming to realize what their gender identity is.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">George said anti-LGBTQ activists are capitalizing on this misunderstanding to advance their agenda. George identified this trend in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3028221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her 2017 paper she published</a> in the Wisconsin Law Review. She noted that from 1999 until 2012, voters regularly supported LGBTQ protections in local ballot measures. But around 2012, anti-LGBTQ activists began highlighting the gender-identity protections in these laws, and the ballot measures began failing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pushaw, for her part, denies that any of this rhetoric is homophobic. She <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5q9vx/child-grooming-lgbtq-smear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Vice News</a> she “never once singled out LGBTQ people” and that the “assumption that criticism of grooming is criticism of the LGBTQ community equates LGBTQ people to groomers, which is both bigoted and inaccurate. Do better. And, any adult who wants to discuss sexual and gender identity topics with other people’s 5- to 8-year-old children—while keeping this a secret from their parents—is either a groomer or is complicit in promoting an environment where grooming becomes normalized.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what’s being normalized here isn’t grooming; it’s the use of homophobic rhetoric and conspiracy theory language. And it’s intended not to protect children but to advance political causes and slander political enemies.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The things Desireé Luckey remembers most about finding out she was pregnant for the first time are how fast the little test strip turned positive — and how irritated it made her feel. It was one more hassle in a summer that already felt overwhelming. Within the span of a few weeks in 2012, Luckey had graduated college, ended an emotionally unsafe relationship and started a new — but frustratingly unpaid — job with former President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign. From her dorm bathroom, she immediately began figuring out what she’d need to do to get an abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelsea McLain also knew she wanted an abortion as soon as she found out she was pregnant. Graduating college during the Great Recession, she was surviving on unemployment and about to lose her apartment. Both women wanted private, inexpensive abortions. Because of that, they chose medication abortion — two pills that, when taken together, <a href="https://nwhn.org/abortion-pills-vs-miscarriage-demystifying-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectively mimic the biology of an early miscarriage</a>. Medication abortion allowed Luckey and McLain to abort their pregnancies at home. It was logistically simpler than going to a clinic for a procedure. It was cheaper. And it was <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-availability-and-use-of-medication-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just as safe</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it can also be terribly painful. McLain suffered through intense cramping, nausea and weeks of heavy vaginal bleeding. Not everyone’s medication abortion is like that — Luckey’s was straightforward and less uncomfortable than periods she’d had, and she was back walking the full parade route at Capital Pride in Washington, D.C., the next day. No one knows ahead of time whether their experience will be more like Luckey’s or more like McLain’s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In just a few months, many more Americans may be rolling that dice. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/mississippi-abortion-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Supreme Court is weighing</a> the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with an opinion expected by June. The court’s conservative majority is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/01/21/1074605184/abortion-roe-v-wade-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to make it easier for states to at least restrict abortion access, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-supreme-court-looks-ready-to-overturn-roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s possible</a> that it could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion, which would allow states to ban abortion outright. If that happens, a lot more people will be obtaining abortion pills illegally.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22968993/abortion-pills-mail-medication-fda-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medication can be an effective tool</a> for people trying to evade abortion restrictions, and it’s much safer than other illegal abortion methods. But as abortion access is further restricted, increased reliance on pills could also make more people struggle through an intensely painful — even traumatic — experience, with little access to medical support, lots of stigma and more legal risk than ever before. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">For almost three decades after abortion became legal, Americans who wanted to end their pregnancies had one option: an in-clinic procedure. That changed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/us/us-approves-abortion-pill-drug-offers-more-privacy-and-could-reshape-debate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the fall of 2000</a>, when the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone, an abortion-inducing drug that allows people to go through the physical process of an abortion at home. To end a pregnancy, people first take mifepristone, which stops the pregnancy from growing. Then the second drug, misoprostol, which is usually taken 24 to 48 hours later, tells the uterus to expel the pregnancy. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to current FDA regulations</a>, the combination can be used until the 10th week of pregnancy.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone who gets an abortion identifies as a woman. We have tried to use gender-neutral language in this story when referring to those who receive abortions, except where we are citing the specific experiences of people who identify as women, studies that identified their participants as women or historical context about how the medical community has treated women as a social class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The introduction of the pill sequence transformed abortion in the U.S. At first, it wasn’t an especially popular choice, largely because the FDA imposed <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2013/03/medication-abortion-restrictions-burden-women-and-providers-and-threaten-us-trend-toward" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots of restrictions</a> on the medication. But that changed in recent years, in part because of the pandemic. By 2020, the Guttmacher Institute estimated that more than half of abortions in the U.S. were medication abortions. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Medication abortions have gotten a lot more popular" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/60Fzz/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As access to in-person abortion dwindles, medication abortion is more available than it’s ever been. For a long time, the FDA’s regulations said that medication abortion needed to be provided in-person, in a medical setting, but after the rules changed — <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-court-blocks-fda-restriction-unnecessarily-imposes-covid-19-risks-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily</a> at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/15/1064598531/the-fda-could-permanently-lift-some-restrictions-on-abortion-pills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then permanently a few months ago</a> — a crop of <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/medication-abortion-telemedicine-innovations-and-barriers-during-the-covid-19-emergency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion-focused telehealth companies</a> sprang up with the goal of making the process as seamless as possible. As a result, it’s now possible to get an abortion in <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/medication-abortion-telemedicine-innovations-and-barriers-during-the-covid-19-emergency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 20 states</a> without ever setting foot in a clinic. That also means it’s cheaper. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Anti-abortion lawmakers have realized this and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/abortion-pills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are trying to crack down</a> on the mail distribution of abortion pills in several states. A Supreme Court decision to allow states to ban first-trimester abortion would likely increase those attempts to control supply, since it’s a big loophole: Even if abortion is illegal, someone could order abortion pills from a telehealth company in a state where it’s legal and mail them to a person in a state where it’s not, or order pills from an online pharmacy. Access to abortion pills could undermine the coming wave of abortion bans, and everyone knows it.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">As medication abortion gets drawn into the political fight over abortion rights, the physical comfort of people seeking those abortions often gets overlooked. The side effects of medication abortion aren’t widely discussed, and it’s easy to understand why. There is <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots of misinformation about abortion pills</a> online, and anti-abortion advocates often <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/health-medicine/science-behind-abortion-pill-180963762/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatly overemphasize</a> side effects like pain, nausea or bleeding in an effort to make the procedure seem dangerous, which it’s not. In a country where abortion is such an intensely polarized issue, it’s hard to hold two ideas in place at the same time — that medication abortion is very safe, and also sometimes unpleasant to go through.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McLain decided to start her abortion while she was moving out of her apartment. As she carried boxes up and down the stairs, her uterus contracted over and over again, working to expel the pregnancy. She started to bleed — a lot. She threw up. After a while, she began to pass big, heavy blood clots. The pain was unbearable. “There were times that my pain was 10 out of 10,” she said. “I felt like I was going to pass out.” And it didn’t stop after a few hours. It just kept going. “I remember thinking everything was over, and then all of a sudden, bleeding heavily again,” she said. “It was like two weeks where I didn’t trust that my body was actually done.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She didn’t regret the abortion. In fact, McLain was intensely relieved that the pregnancy was over. But she felt traumatized by the pain, the isolation and the unshakeable feeling that the pain was her punishment for getting pregnant in the first place. The difficulty of the experience felt like something she had to stoically deal with, though in retrospect she thinks her feelings of anxiety and shame actually made the pain worse. “That whole experience, how alone I felt when I didn't need to feel alone, it really just left this lasting impact on me about the injustice of it all,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But McLain’s experience is not a rare one. Although <a href="https://www.ipas.org/clinical-update/english/pain-management/pain-management-for-medical-abortion-before-13-weeks-gestation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most clinical trials of medication abortion</a> don’t track it, the few studies that do suggest pain is common. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16781260/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2006 systematic review</a>, for example, found that 75 percent of women in five large studies from the U.S. and United Kingdom experienced pain severe enough to be treated with narcotics. In other studies, women consistently reported high levels of pain — with averages <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13625187.2017.1315092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranging from 5.6</a> on a 10-point pain scale to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21237336/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.4 on an 11-point pain scale</a>. “There are people who are still experiencing severe pain, and we need to do additional studies to find ways to help people manage their severe pain at home,” said <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/alyssa-colwill-md-mcr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Alyssa Colwill</a>, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health &amp; Science University who studies pain relief for medication abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And although most people who have gotten medication abortions <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X22000175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say they are satisfied</a> with them — <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00017-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as high as 98.4 percent who reported their experience in one</a> study — that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17303494/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may not tell us much</a> about how they felt. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/20/3/834/2356484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When one survey compared medication abortion with the alternative</a> — an outpatient, physical procedure sometimes erroneously called a "surgical abortion" — more people seemed satisfied with the in-clinic option. Colwill said that to her, the high satisfaction numbers for medication abortion are just women “telling us they’re happy they’re no longer pregnant.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is part of a larger problem that goes far beyond abortion. In general, gynecological pain isn't well studied or well treated. “Pain, generally in medicine but particularly in obstetrics and gynecology, has been minimized and overlooked, and that's related to misogyny,” said <a href="https://obgyn.ucsf.edu/san-francisco-general-hospital/daniel-grossman-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Daniel Grossman</a>, director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health program at the University of California, San Francisco. “There was kind of an assumption that women could tolerate the pain.” This is a pattern that’s <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=383803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-documented</a> in medicine — women’s pain tends to be undertreated for all kinds of conditions, from <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/PainNews/women-chronic-pain/story?id=15598143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronic illnesses</a> like fibromyalgia to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/is-bias-keeping-female-minority-patients-from-getting-proper-care-for-their-pain/2019/07/26/9d1b3a78-a810-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more acute issues</a> like broken bones. Other forms of reproductive care, like IUD insertions, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iud-insertion-pain_l_5c7fe889e4b0e62f69e8b919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also notoriously painful for some</a>, with many women reporting that their experiences were just shrugged off. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the challenge is that it’s hard to predict what any one person will experience. Doctors might not want to offer heavy hitting pain medications right away, since it’s possible that the experience will be like Luckey’s — uncomfortable, but not a big deal. But for people who have a lot of pain, the options for relief are not great. McLain, who had her abortion before the opioid crisis <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2737896" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made doctors leery</a> of prescribing narcotics, could take the painkiller hydrocodone if things got bad. In the U.K., where the vast majority of abortions <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/home-use-of-both-pills-for-early-medical-abortion/home-use-of-both-pills-for-early-medical-abortion-up-to-10-weeks-gestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are medication abortions</a>, patients who choose to do their abortion at home receive another painkiller, dihydrocodeine, as part of their take-home package. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the U.S., however, most abortion patients now get <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2020/10/medication-abortion-up-to-70-days-of-gestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a strong dose of ibuprofen</a> — a choice consistent with <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240039483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization guidelines</a>. In the studies those guidelines are based on, ibuprofen was the only treatment to consistently produce evidence of reducing pain during a medical abortion, said <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Reynolds-Wright" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Reynolds-Wright</a>, a clinical research fellow at the University of Edinburgh who is currently working to synthesize the evidence on pain management for medication abortion. But that's not the same thing as ibuprofen working<em> well</em>, he told us. And those studies looked at 800- or even 1,600-milligram doses of ibuprofen, much higher than the 400-milligram dose people are used to taking at home. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pain, as Colwill pointed out, doesn’t necessarily indicate something is unsafe, even though everyone wants to avoid it. But if abortion is banned, people could be taking abortion pills without much medical guidance, and the consequences could be more dire. Several states, including Oklahoma and South Carolina, <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wirf-abortion-bans/criminalization-of-self-managed-abortion-in-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already have laws on the books</a> that can be used to prosecute people who self-manage abortion. <a href="https://law.fsu.edu/faculty-staff/mary-ziegler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ziegler</a>, a professor at Florida State University College of Law who studies abortion law, said that because states will find it hard to enforce abortion bans as long as pills can be mailed in discreet packages, more anti-abortion state lawmakers might consider making it a crime to use abortion pills or help someone obtain them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If that happens, people could end up being prosecuted if they use abortion medications in a state where it's illegal, particularly if they end up going to the hospital. Physically, there's no way for medical professionals to be able to tell the difference between a pregnancy loss induced by abortion drugs and one that happened as part of a miscarriage, Grossman said. And the only way the difference would matter medically is if the patient had induced their abortion with some other substance like an herb concoction, rather than tested, FDA-approved meds.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that's not information people will necessarily know. In 2018, one group of researchers ordered abortion pills from 16 different websites and found that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782417304754#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none of them came with instructions</a>. Some people may make the mistake of telling medical staff about taking abortion meds — and then find themselves in legal trouble. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2015/09/prosecuting-women-self-inducing-abortion-counterproductive-and-lacking-compassion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s rare</a> for people to be prosecuted for self-managed abortion, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/magazine/purvi-patel-could-be-just-the-beginning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it has happened</a>. “Unfortunately, a lot of the ways that people have been criminalized is through the providers they turn to for help,” said Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel at <a href="https://www.ifwhenhow.org/about/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If/When/How</a>, a legal advocacy group that focuses on reproductive justice issues. That happened in 2012 when a woman in Pennsylvania helped her daughter obtain abortion pills online. The daughter later went to the hospital because the pain was so frightening and unexpected. The mother told hospital personnel about the pills, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/magazine/a-mother-in-jail-for-helping-her-daughter-have-an-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they reported her</a> to child protective services, and she ended up in jail.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even if it doesn’t end with prosecution, self-managing an abortion can be a scary and isolating experience. That’s a harm that women will have to absorb, too. And even though it has expanded access significantly, medication abortion won’t preserve abortion access if restrictions continue to mount. For one thing, there are limits to how much telehealth abortion companies can help people in states where abortion is illegal. Leah Coplon, the medical director at <a href="https://abortionondemand.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abortion on Demand</a>, a telehealth abortion company, said that although it’s very helpful, remote access to medication abortion can’t replace brick-and-mortar clinics. “I hesitate to have telehealth medication abortion seem like a panacea,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And perhaps most fundamentally, as abortion becomes more restricted, people are losing the ability to decide for themselves what the experience will be like. Luckey and McLain both went on to have other abortions, and their decisions weren’t what you’d necessarily expect. Despite having a good experience with medication abortion, Luckey opted for an in-clinic abortion later, wanting the procedure to be over and done with quickly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McLain, meanwhile, had two more medication abortions — both of which were less traumatic than the first. By the time she needed another abortion, she was working in reproductive health and felt much less stressed about the whole process. For her, the feeling of being in control and lack of stress changed everything. “It was no big deal,” she said. “I remember the abortion being so completely pain-free and uneventful, I was worried it didn't work.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been nearly 14 years since Sarah Palin became one of the best-known and most polarizing politicians in the country as Sen. John McCain’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election. Since then, Palin has teased a comeback several times, but her campaign to run in this year’s special House election in Alaska is her <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-alaskas-special-election-create-an-opening-for-sarah-palins-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first attempt</a> to return to electoral politics. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew explains why Palin may not be a shoo-in for the seat left behind when Rep. Don Young died in March.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also debate whether the AARP is correct that <a href="https://press.aarp.org/2022-4-6-Women-Voters-Age-50-Over-Will-Decide-Balance-Power-Next-Election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women age 50 and over</a> will determine the outcome of the 2022 midterms. Finally, they discuss the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-in-blue-cities-are-increasingly-outliers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiences</a> of urban Republicans and rural Democrats in a country increasingly sorted geographically and politically.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Jonathan M. remembers seeing the signs clearly: One for the Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-backed <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/01/greg-casar-democratic-primary-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Casar</a> and another, near it, for Rep. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/17/lloyd-doggett-austin-congress-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lloyd Doggett</a>, a member of the <a href="https://progressives.house.gov/caucus-members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Progressive Caucus</a> who was running for a neighboring district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yard placards for both progressive Democratic politicians, he said, were littered throughout his neighborhood in Austin, Texas in the lead-up to the state’s primary elections in March. On the one hand, this shouldn’t be surprising: Austin — likened to a “blueberry in a bowl of tomato soup” <a href="https://twitter.com/markzbarabak/status/1178115321590353921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least once</a> by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry — is <a href="https://austin.culturemap.com/news/city-life/09-12-16-best-american-cities-liberals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known for its deep blue</a> hue. But as a Republican, Jonathan M., who preferred to only use his first name and last initial out of privacy concerns, didn’t plan to vote for either candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the self-described “classical conservative” told me that he voted in the Republican primary in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/texas-election-biden-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last month’s elections</a>. But voters like Jonathan M. are somewhat of a rare breed in Austin. According to countywide voting records, only <a href="https://countyclerk.traviscountytx.gov/wp-content/uploads/election_results_2022.03.01/RepublicanParty.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 6 percent</a> of registered voters in Travis County, <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/resident/about-city-austin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where Austin primarily sits</a>, voted in the state’s Republican primary, <a href="https://countyclerk.traviscountytx.gov/wp-content/uploads/election_results_2022.03.01/DemocraticParty.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared to almost 13 percent</a> who cast a ballot in the Democratic one. (<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/14/texas-primary-voting-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turnout was low</a>, however, like in most primaries.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just raw voting numbers that have helped Jonathan M. feel like an outlier: He said it took a drive down a major highway or perusal online to find even a <em>handful</em> of ads for Republican candidates. And even then, only marquee races, like the one for governor, were heavily advertised. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This primary cycle, I didn’t see any Republican signs in my area, but in 2020 I saw a lot of signs for Rep. Chip Roy,” he said, referencing the Austin-area Republican who <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/12/06/chip-roy-former-cruz-chief-staff-running-lamar-smiths-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once worked for</a> Sen. Ted Cruz and has since become a conservative firebrand in the U.S. House. “For big races, I feel like there’s a lot more campaigning by Republicans here, but there’s almost nothing happening for local races and, as a result, I feel like a lot of Democrats run unopposed.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of this is to be expected given just how much the U.S. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550621994000#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sorts itself</a> along geographic lines, with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-3-political-polarization-and-personal-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats preferring to live in</a> cities versus Republicans, who increasingly opt to call smaller towns or rural areas home. But this ideological sorting has still created a situation where many Republicans who live in the suburbs and bluer cities feel like outliers in their communities — much like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-it-like-being-a-democrat-in-trump-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats living in Trump country</a>. Some of the voters we spoke with would tease their ideological preferences (through having a GOP candidate’s bumper sticker on their car, for instance), but most have kept their political opinions to themselves. Several expressed having trouble finding friends with similar values who live close to them, and many felt like their party had largely given up on campaigning in their area of town. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there was one bright spot that helped many of the five Republicans and independent voters who have previously supported Republican candidates I spoke with feel more upbeat: the upcoming midterm elections. Expecting their party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to likely flip the U.S. House</a>, and maybe pick up a few seats in the U.S. Senate, was a way for them to reconcile their political identity even if representation wasn’t going to change where they lived. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I am more excited about the national results than the local races,” Charlie C., a 28-year-old self-proclaimed “staunch conservative” from St. Anthony, Minnesota, who only wanted to be identified by his first name and last initial, told me. “I am hoping that this year’s results are reminiscent of the Tea Party red wave from 2014.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been some time, though, since Republicans like Charlie C. likely felt this way as counties including the one he currently lives in have steadily gotten bluer. In fact, that’s been the case with practically <em>all</em> “urban-suburban” counties in the U.S.: From 2000 to 2020, “urban-suburban” counties have moved nearly 17 points toward Democrats, among them are Hennepin County and Ramsey County (where St. Anthony resides), according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of county-level election data since 2000 categorized using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Urbanization Index</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not all suburban counties have swung so dramatically toward Democrats. For instance, “mostly suburban” counties have moved from about 50-50 in 2000 to just a 10-point Democratic edge in 2020. But suburban and urban areas have, on average, moved toward Democrats. What’s more, they comprise a large share of the nation’s voting power: In 2020, “urban-suburban” or “mostly suburban” counties made up almost 52 percent of the total vote.<strong> </strong></p>

Ted] Cruz is far enough to the right in a district that elected [Rep.] Ilhan Omar.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the issue for voters like Charlie C. is that Democrats have expanded their foothold in the suburban areas of the U.S. — particularly during former President Donald Trump’s tenure. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a>, suburbanites backed Trump narrowly over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 2 points in 2016. But in 2018, Democrats took back control of the House thanks, in part, to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant inroads</a> they made in America’s suburbs and, by 2020, President Biden won suburban voters over Trump by 11 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nijman-American-Suburbs-Global-Suburbanisms/dp/1487520778" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jan Nijman</a>, the director of the Urban Studies Institute at Georgia State University, told me part of the swing toward Democrats can be attributed to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-07/the-changing-demographics-of-america-s-suburbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changing demographics</a> of the suburbs, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including an increase</a> in the number of college-educated and nonwhite voters living there. “We’ve seen most of our population growth in the U.S. in areas we’d think of as ‘suburban.’ And just that simple fact means there’s now more diversity in those places,” Nijman said. Another consequence of the suburbs becoming more economically and racially diverse, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/18/opinion/suburbs-poor-diverse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly in the last two decades</a>, “is that [they’ve] become the most dynamic places in the electoral landscape,” Nijman said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It wasn’t always like this, though. In fact, suburbs were once the desired destination for those looking to <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/white-flight-2-36805862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flee more diverse, urban areas</a> — especially for more conservative white voters. In the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republicans-lost-suburbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1950s and ’60s</a>, Nijman told me, “suburbia was understood as a place that was quite homogeneous and predictable, meaning that the people attracted to suburbs at the time were solidly middle-class and Republican-leaning.” That’s changed over the last 20 or so years, however, as the suburbs have become more welcoming <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/120372/white-suburbs-are-more-and-more-thing-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for people of color</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/12/americas-immigrants-are-moving-to-the-suburbs/431748/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigrants</a> — <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both of whom</a> tend to be <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/do-immigrants-make-united-states-more-left-wing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal politically</a>. As a result, on average, the suburbs now lean toward Democrats, leaving some Republicans who live in these areas feeling neglected by the GOP. It’s possible that the GOP may make some inroads in 2022, particularly in counties classified as “mostly suburban,” but those areas have still overwhelmingly moved toward Democrats since 2000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I definitely feel abandoned by the state party and like they’ve kind of given up on Atlanta,” said Michael A., a 25-year-old who preferred to only use his first name and last initial out of privacy concerns. “For the past few years or so, they’ve stopped talking about issues that matter in the metro area — like how high our taxes are or how the cost of living has gone up dramatically. They’re really focused on the rural areas more now, which I understand, but there are still a lot of Republican voters in my area who feel unheard.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, even though their communities are moving left, some Republicans I spoke with said they’re moving further <em>right</em>. A handful of my interviewees pointed to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-has-and-hasnt-changed-since-george-floyd-was-murdered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests for racial justice</a> in the summer of 2020 following the murder of George Floyd as a turning point. Democratic calls at the time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/defund-police-protests-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to radically shift police policy</a>, including a reduction in police budgets, turned off many Republicans I spoke with.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If I wasn’t conservative before 2020, I would’ve been a hardcore one after that summer,” said Chris Germiller, a 28-year-old from Rockville, Maryland. “For many reasons, that was the worst time of my life due to the constant onslaught of everyone I knew pretending they were a criminologist and prescribing insane policy solutions toward policing. That summer pushed me, emotionally, more to the right.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of Germiller’s frustration likely stems from the fact that, on average, suburban and urban residents <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold more liberal views</a> on issues of racism and racial justice than rural Americans. According to a 2018 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew survey</a>, 69 percent of urban residents and 60 percent of suburban ones (compared to 47 percent of rural dwellers) said they believed that white Americans benefit from certain privileges that Black Americans don’t have. And while many of the Republicans I spoke with said they believe racism still plays a prominent role in today’s society, they didn’t think reducing or eliminating law enforcement was the answer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Ideas like ‘defund the police’ are just crazy to me. Why would you defund the police?” said Liliana S., a 49-year-old Denver, Colorado resident who was born in Venezuela and preferred to only use her first name and last initial out of privacy concerns. “I come from a country where police are not funded and not respected. The result is you get a bunch of mafia and drug lords and common thieves running the country.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, some of the shift to the left on policing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/police-reform-minneapolis-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is overstated</a> and it’s possible that, while these Republicans are outliers in some of their views toward policing, they might have more in common with their liberal neighbors than they realize. For example, prominent leaders in the Democratic Party, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/politics/joe-biden-defund-the-police/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Biden</a>, have emphatically dismissed calls to “defund the police.” Moreover, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-like-the-ideas-behind-defunding-the-police-more-than-the-slogan-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls suggest</a> that voters — regardless of where they live — don’t want to cut funding to police departments. According to a June 2020 <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/06/17/defund-the-police-community-programs-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> survey, less than half of suburban dwellers (43 percent) supported redirecting police funds to communities, while 28 percent were in favor of “defund the police.” A September <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from Pew</a> also showed a significant decline in overall support for cutting police funding. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, “defund the police” has become a motivating issue for Republican voters. This is, in part, because GOP lawmakers have <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-defund-the-police-attacks-democrats-election-2020_n_5fb68698c5b695be83008c57" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capitalized on the movement</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-convinced-crime-is-rising-in-the-u-s-theyre-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successfully tied it to unsubstantiated fears</a> regarding <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/22/1018996709/rising-violent-crime-is-likely-to-present-a-political-challenge-for-democrats-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an increase in violent crime</a> regardless of whether that’s actually happening. In addition, several cities <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/06/18/2020-protests-impact-city-and-state-changes-policing/5337751002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took steps in 2020</a> to change policing that Republicans said rubbed them the wrong way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jonathan M., for example, said he was disappointed when Austin’s City Council voted that year to slash <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/08/13/austin-city-council-cut-police-budget-defund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the city’s police budget</a>, which it was later <a href="https://www.kut.org/austin/2021-08-12/austin-passes-4-5-billion-budget-increases-police-budget-per-state-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced to refund</a> amid pressure <a href="https://www.kut.org/austin/2021-08-11/last-year-austin-cut-its-police-budget-by-millions-a-new-state-law-means-itll-likely-reverse-that-move-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the state’s Republican governor</a>. For a while, though, he claimed that he heard numerous stories from neighbors who were robbed or burglarized, but who were still hesitant to call the police for assistance. “Some people are against calling the cops because they think it will result in escalation of the issue,” he said. “I disagree, of course, but knowing how my neighbors feel about these things makes me more reserved, and I try to keep a distance from those conversations.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This has exacerbated a belief among people I spoke with that Democrats (and, in turn, their respective cities) have moved <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even further to the left</a>, specifically on issues related to race and public safety. And many of the Republicans I talked to say they no longer feel like they can have constructive conversations with their neighbors and coworkers about policies they disagree on — a sentiment that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-it-like-being-a-democrat-in-trump-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats living in rural areas of the U.S. felt</a>, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s tough to grow a friend circle. Admittedly, I’m a bit of an introvert to begin with, but even at work, it’s tough to talk about anything other than shop because this is a left-leaning area,” Charlie C., the conservative voter in Minnesota, said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even though Republicans like Charlie C. might feel like outsiders now, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-2022-be-a-good-year-for-republicans-yes-we-know-its-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are signs</a> that 2022 will likely be a good year for Republicans nationally. And because some of the areas my interviewees lived in aren’t as blue <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-it-like-being-a-democrat-in-trump-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as some rural areas are red</a>, it’s possible these Republicans will even see some political changes in their areas, especially those in more suburban or exurban areas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You know, even if the Republican Party isn’t going to win Fulton County anytime soon, there are hundreds of thousands of Republican voters in urban areas and if you get them excited, they’re going to put you over the finish line,” said Michael A., who noted that he’s seen a handful of bumper stickers for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in recent weeks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, 2022 offers prime pick-up opportunities for Republicans: According to our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot average</a>, which tracks which party people plan to vote for in the upcoming congressional election — Republicans currently lead Democrats by about 2 percentage points. Moreover, since much of the previous suburban <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/27/668726284/where-the-suburbs-moved-left-and-how-it-swung-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shift toward Democrats in 2018</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/07/suburban-voters-got-behind-trumps-message-2016-now-they-are-walking-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 appears to have been driven</a> by disdain for Trump, it’s not clear whether these gains will hold without him on the ballot. This is evident in <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling from Reuters/Ipsos</a> which has found that Biden is struggling to hold suburban voters since coming into office last year: Only 44 percent said they approve of his job as president as of last week — down nearly 7 points since around this time last year.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Without Trump on the ballot, Biden might lose ground in suburbs" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/81vnE/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="602" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Polling from <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/January-2022_HHP_Crosstab.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll</a> released in January tells a similar story. It found that 57 percent of suburban respondents were more likely to vote for a Republican candidate in the midterms, versus 43 percent who said they’d be more likely to vote for a Democratic one. What’s also working in the GOP’s favor is that the party so far has capitalized on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/schoolhouse-culture-wars-factor-2022-midterms/story?id=83343766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an enticing pitch</a> to rile up voters: highlighting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-keep-losing-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">culture war issues</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-really-really-dislike-biden-but-its-not-just-about-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad disapproval with the Biden administration</a>. On top of that, Glenn Youngkin’s win in Virginia last year suggests that it’s possible for certain Republicans to win competitive states — including parts of the suburbs — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/trump-republican-governor-race-glenn-youngkin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the right roadmap</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means Republicans in blue cities and suburbs might have reason to be optimistic for November, especially since 2022 will likely serve as a test of sorts for how durable suburban gains have been and whether we’ll see a lurch back to the right. Of course, that won’t change the makeup of some very urban areas that have voted solidly Democratic for the last two decades or so, but it does mean that some of these Republicans might not be the outliers that they think they are. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Charlie C. put it plainly: “It’s less that the GOP has abandoned [my] area, and more that they are out-gunned. They don’t have the ability to mobilize in every district,” he said. “I realize I am in enemy territory. I’m just hoping to be able to minimize some of the damage.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Five years ago, Emmanuel Macron <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39839349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a sweeping victory</a> to become the youngest president in France’s history. Running at the head of The Republic On The Move,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La République En Marche! in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> a <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/02/06/emmanuel-macron-liberal-centrist-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centrist and pro-European Union party</a> he had founded <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/04/06/emmanuel-macron-lance-un-mouvement-politique-nouveau-baptise-en-marche_4897274_823448.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2016</a>, Macron defeated his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen, by more than 30 percentage points and <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/10/france-mainstream-parties-survival-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke the hold</a> of the traditional center-right and center-left parties over French politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as France prepares for the first round of presidential voting on Sunday, Macron is fighting to maintain his centrist coalition in the face of more radical alternatives. Not totally unlike the United States and other parts of Europe, France has experienced <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/europe/2022/03/29/fractured-france" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep political cleavages</a> between its urban and rural, affluent and working class and native and immigrant populations. And a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/magazine/new-french-right.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burgeoning political right</a> has stoked anti-immigrant and nationalist sentiment in the <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/eps/6073?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethnically and culturally diverse</a> country. Add in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/people-feel-suffocated-cost-of-living-tops-french-concerns-before-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns about the cost of living</a>, and it’s no wonder Macron faces a tough reelection battle. Once again, it’s Le Pen who looks most likely to stand in his way, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Based on <a href="https://github.com/nsppolls/nsppolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey data collected</a> by French journalist Alexandre Léchenet, Macron and Le Pen hold strong leads over the rest of the field in Sunday’s first-round vote, with Macron leading the field at a bit north of 25 percent, on average, and Le Pen in second in the low 20s. Only one other candidate, far-left contender Jean-Luc Mélenchon, is polling above 10 percent.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Macron and Le Pen are the two candidates likeliest to advance" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DXmjZ/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">However, as no candidate is polling anywhere near 50 percent, a runoff election between the top two vote-getters on April 24 is a near certainty at this point, as a candidate must secure a majority of the vote in order to win on Sunday. Those two candidates are very likely to be Macron and Le Pen. <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/france-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist’s forecast</a> currently gives Macron and Le Pen a 98 percent and 93 percent chance of advancing to the runoff, respectively. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s troubling for Macron, though, is that Le Pen’s gains suggest she could pose a real threat in the runoff, as she has consolidated support on the political right while her two main rivals, Valérie Pécresse and Éric Zemmour, have lost ground. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Le Pen and her party, the National Rally<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rassemblement National in French.&lt;/p&gt;

But in this election, Le Pen has placed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cost-living-woes-boost-phoenix-le-pen-race-french-presidency-2022-03-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater emphasis on kitchen table issues</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-immigration-business-migration-presidential-elections-1b63d3f94583427ad570588564d46061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including calls</a> to cut taxes on energy and raise base pensions, which may broaden her appeal considering that many in France <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/france-macron-vows-inflation-relief-at-election-rally/a-61339459" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are worried about inflation</a>. To be sure, her party maintains a strong anti-immigrant platform that aims to weaken immigrants’ access to government benefits and shut out many asylum seekers, but Le Pen <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/99f9e50b-1134-4af2-b85c-831c0e325157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has welcomed Ukrainian refugees</a> as she tries to distance herself from <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220304-ukraine-war-puts-france-s-nato-sceptic-presidential-candidates-in-a-tight-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her past praise</a> of Russian President Vladimir Putin. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Le Pen’s hard-right edge may have also been softened in voters’ eyes given Zemmour’s far-right campaign. A <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/marine-le-pen-and-eric-zemmour-je-taime-moi-non-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political commentator</a> who has <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/10/france-eric-zemmour-president-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">espoused racist, anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic views</a> and been <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/frances-eric-zemmour-announces-presidential-candidacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convicted twice of inciting hatred,</a> Zemmour seemed to initially <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take a bite out of Le Pen’s support</a> last fall, but his campaign never quite took off, and he has since slipped in the polls. Meanwhile, Le Pen may also be winning over some conservative voters who <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/valerie-pecresse-macron-hard-right-french-election-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoned Pécresse</a> and her center-right party, The Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Les Républicains in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the French left, which has been in a <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/14/france-macron-left-election-socialist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state of disarray</a> in recent years, hasn’t yet consolidated around Macron. Instead, Mélenchon of the France Unbowed party<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La France Insoumise in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> has been gaining ground in the polls. Mélenchon may be gaining traction for his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/world/europe/melenchon-france-election-left.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign promises</a> to reintroduce a wealth tax that ended during Macron’s administration and lower the retirement age from 62 to 60. Then again, Mélenchon is still polling considerably behind both Le Pen and Macron, so his campaign might be most significant for whether Macron can win over many of Mélenchon’s voters in a runoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Until a few weeks ago, though, Macron didn’t look like he was in trouble. In fact, his handling of the war in Ukraine had significantly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/05/france-election-macron-le-pen-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted his standing</a> at home. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Macron’s first-round polling numbers jumped from the mid-20s to around 30 percent, as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/world/europe/macron-france-russia-ukraine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned plaudits for his diplomatic efforts</a> to halt the Russian invasion, and when that failed, praise for his tough stance toward Russia both militarily and economically. Tellingly, his numbers hit 60 percent in some head-to-head surveys against Le Pen ahead of a possible runoff. However, as the war in Ukraine has dragged on, Macron’s bump has dissipated — in fact, he’s slipped below where he was prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as the chart below shows.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Macron now holds only a narrow lead over Le Pen in runoff polls" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/44o8K/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="475" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s not really clear why Macron’s numbers have dropped so dramatically, as he still enjoys relatively high support for his handling of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-03-12/france-macron-russia-putin-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign policy</a>. Part of it could have to do with low marks for his <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220311-trickle-down-in-drips-and-drops-the-french-economy-after-five-years-under-macron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempts to liberalize France’s economy</a>, including making it easier for companies to lay off workers and lowering business taxes, which <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220323-yellow-vest-protests-covid-19-stymied-macron-s-plans-for-social-welfare-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t been popular</a>. Some critics have called him “the candidate of the rich,” and moves like getting rid of the wealth tax and reducing social spending assistance have played into that. And Macron’s policies have resulted in populist outcry before, as a proposed gas tax hike in 2018 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/03/672862353/who-are-frances-yellow-vest-protesters-and-what-do-they-want" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led to nationwide protests</a> in what became known as the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220401-will-france-s-yellow-vests-come-back-to-haunt-macron-on-election-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yellow Vest Movement</a>. Now his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-oppose-macrons-proposed-later-retirement-poll-shows-election-looms-2022-04-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign is pushing the unpopular position</a> of raising the retirement age, which may also explain why the race between him and Le Pen has narrowed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, polling between Macron and Le Pen has gotten close enough that Le Pen is just a normal polling error away from winning: <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/macron-won-but-the-french-polls-were-way-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The average error</a> between the poll margin two weeks before the election and the runoff result has been about 4.6 points in French presidential elections from 1969 to 2017, and polling averages produced by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico</a> and <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/FRANCE-ELECTION/POLLS/zjvqkomzlvx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> each put Macron’s runoff lead at 6 points. In other words, a slightly larger-than-normal error could make Le Pen France’s next president. And there’s still time for the race to tighten further, as the likely runoff will take place two weeks after the first round.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, we should be careful about interpreting just how close the margin is because French polling doesn’t include undecided voters, who may or may not vote. For instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/electo_mania/status/1512102062280036361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos’s latest tracking poll</a> of the likely Macron-Le Pen runoff found that about 1 in 5 first-round voters wouldn’t cast a vote. This was an issue in 2017, too, <a href="http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/FRANCE-ELECTION/010040SZ1RE/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as turnout fell in the second round</a>, and it could continue to be one in the 2022 runoff because some voters, particularly those on the left, may not be particularly enthused about either candidate. To be sure, what happened in 2017 wasn’t the norm; voter participation has usually risen at least a little bit in presidential runoffs. But many voters <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-election-president-2022-abstention-what-if-nobody-came/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may not cast a ballot at all</a> this year, which could endanger Macron if the political right is more energized to vote than the center.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bottom line: The French presidential election looks to be much closer now than it did a couple of weeks ago. The Economist’s model had put Macron’s reelection chances north of 90 percent in late March; now his odds of winning are slightly better than 3 in 4. Macron is still the clear favorite, but tightening polls have raised the prospect that he will lose the runoff if things go Le Pen’s way.</p>

Forty-four percent of respondents said they worried about the quality of the environment a great deal, down only slightly from highs of 47 percent in 2017 and 2019. When asked about specific environmental problems, the greatest share of respondents said they were worried about pollution of drinking water (57 percent), while the smallest share of respondents listed global warming or climate change (43 percent) as their top concern.</li><li><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-63-of-americans-say-putin-cannot-remain-in-power-090049601.html">Most Americans agree with the sentiment</a> that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power — but that doesn’t mean they approve of President Biden having said it <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-transcript-president-bidens-speech-warsaw-russias-invasion/story?id=83690301">in a March 26 speech in Warsaw</a>, according to a March 31-April 4 poll from Yahoo News/YouGov. When the quote about Putin — “This man cannot remain in power” — was unattributed, 63 percent agreed with it. But when the pollster asked whether Biden was right or wrong to have said it,” just 48 percent of Americans said he was right. Both Democrats and Republicans were less likely to agree with this statement when it was attributed to Biden: 57 percent of Republicans agreed with the unattributed statement, whereas only 37 percent said the same when told Biden said it; meanwhile, 83 percent of Democrats agreed with the unattributed statement, while 70 percent said the same when told Biden said it.</li><li><a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/06/autonomous-vehicles-safety-and-trust/">Trust in autonomous vehicles (also known as self-driving cars) remains low.</a> In fact, the share of Americans who say that they trust autonomous vehicles to be safer than traditional cars has gone down since 2018.

Overall, 78 percent agreed that social media companies have the right to remove any person considered to violate the platform’s terms of service and 72 percent agreed that social media companies had the right to block any post they considered inappropriate. Large majorities also said they supported social media companies removing posts that probably have false information (75 percent), promote violence against particular individuals or groups (80 percent) or pose a risk to the public (79 percent). But at the same time, 69 percent of respondents agreed that companies have a clear political agenda in who and what they block.

Opinions of CNN were the most politically polarized: 66 percent of Democrats said it was very or somewhat trustworthy, versus just 11 percent of Republicans.

<p data-paragraph="main">Should marijuana be legal in the United States? Over the past 20 years, Americans’ have reversed their views on that question to a degree rarely seen in politics. In 2001, 34 percent of Americans said yes, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1657/illegal-drugs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Gallup</a>. Today it’s 68 percent. A breadth of polling suggests a majority of Americans now favor either <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-55-americans-favor-decriminalizing-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decriminalizing <em>all</em> drug use</a> or significantly <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2016/02/12/voters-want-changes-in-federal-sentencing-prison-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changing the punishment for it</a>.</p>

As Congress considers legislation that would decriminalize marijuana and end the sentencing disparity for crack and cocaine offenses, Galen Druke speaks with FiveThirtyEight contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/leddder?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lester Black</a> about what Americans think should be done about drugs and how politicians are responding.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Everything’s part of the culture wars now, including Supreme Court confirmations. Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation process ended on Thursday when the Senate voted 53-47 to confirm her to the court, and it was quick — it took just six weeks to move from nomination to confirmation — and partisan. Many Republicans spent Jackson’s nomination hearings accusing her of giving light sentences to child pornographers (<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fact-check-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-child-porn/story?id=83565833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she didn’t</a>), supporting teaching critical race theory in secondary school (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/03/23/ketanji-jackson-georgetown-day-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence for that either</a>) and trying to let dangerous criminals out of prison (<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/22/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-misleads-about-jacksons-record-re/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nope</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s pretty much what we can expect from Supreme Court confirmations going forward, even when the stakes for the court are very low. For the past six years, as Republicans refused to hold a hearing for former President Barack Obama’s last Supreme Court pick and then ended the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, narrow majorities to confirm justices have been the rule. And it’s particularly noteworthy that many Republican senators went all-out against the first Black woman to be nominated to the court, although her presence on the court won’t shift its ideological balance. In fact, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lindsey-graham-ketanji-brown-jackson-wouldnt-get-hearing-republicans-senate-2022-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said</a> that if his party had been in control, Jackson wouldn’t have gotten a hearing at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this signals that Supreme Court confirmations remain extremely contentious regardless of whether control of the court is at stake. And going forward, it’s unlikely that new Supreme Court nominees will make it onto the court unless the president’s party is also in charge of the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The partisanship of Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination was apparent from the roll-call vote. All 50 Democratic senators voted for Jackson — even Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who have voted against the party on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-failed-voting-rights-push-is-a-setback-for-democracy-and-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other high-profile issues</a>. This shouldn’t necessarily surprise us, though. Manchin and Sinema have voted for every single person Biden has nominated to be a federal judge so far, including Jackson when she was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit last year. In fact, no Democratic senator has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-and-kyrsten-sinema-will-probably-vote-for-bidens-supreme-court-pick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ever voted against one of Biden’s federal judicial picks</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The real question going into Jackson’s confirmation was whether she would get any Republican votes. Three Republicans have voted for a majority of Biden’s federal judicial nominees thus far: Graham and Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. (They were also the only three Republicans to vote for <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1171/vote_117_1_00231.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackson’s appeals-court nomination</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two of those three ended up voting to confirm Jackson to the Supreme Court: Collins and Murkowski, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two most moderate members</a> of the Senate GOP caucus. Murkowski’s decision was most interesting, since she is facing a tough reelection campaign this year against conservative Kelly Tshibaka, who has the <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/06/18/trump-gives-complete-and-total-endorsement-to-tshibaka-in-alaska-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement</a> of former President Donald Trump. But a <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/RCV.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new primary election system</a> in Alaska — whereby all candidates, regardless of party, run on the same ballot and the top-four finishers go on to a ranked-choice general election — has largely eliminated the need for Murkowski to run to the right in order to survive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A third Republican voted for Jackson as well — but it wasn’t Graham, who cited her “<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article259979510.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flawed sentencing methodology regarding child pornography cases</a>” in voting against her. Instead, it was Sen. Mitt Romney, who has voted for just 23 percent of Biden’s federal judicial nominees. His yea vote was particularly surprising given that he voted against Jackson for the court of appeals; the last time a senator voted to confirm someone to the Supreme Court whom they had voted against for a lower court was in 1994.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/96-1980/s1021" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;former Sens. Daniel Inouye, John Danforth, John Glenn and Fritz Hollings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1032/vote_103_2_00242.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;voted for Breyer&lt;/a&gt; (whose seat, of course, Jackson will soon fill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the grand scheme of things, the three Republican yea votes were a drop in the bucket compared with the 47 Republican nay votes. The mostly party-line vote fits a pattern of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-harder-than-ever-to-confirm-a-supreme-court-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court nominations becoming more partisan</a>. Throughout the 20th century, most senators — even those belonging to the opposition party — typically voted for a president’s Supreme Court nominee as long as he or she was qualified. But since Justice Samuel Alito’s nomination in October 2005, most opposition-party senators have voted against Supreme Court nominees.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Supreme Court nominations have become increasingly partisan" aria-label="Scatter Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YaG40/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="577" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And Republicans didn’t just express their opposition to Jackson through their votes. The increased rancor of Supreme Court nominations was also evident during her confirmation hearing, when some members of the GOP attempted to paint her as a dangerous person who was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fact-check-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-child-porn/story?id=83565833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soft on crime</a>, believed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/us/politics/cruz-jackson-antiracist-baby.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">babies are racist</a> and wanted to “indoctrinat[e]” white families about antiracism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sens. Ted Cruz and Marsha Blackburn were two of the most vocal opponents. Cruz used Jackson’s status <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/us/politics/georgetown-day-school-jackson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a board of trustees member</a> at Georgetown Day School to question her views on <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-sen-ted-cruz-presses-ketanji-jackson-brown-on-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what he refered to as</a> critical race theory, which is typically not taught in K-12 education, and Blackburn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-woman-definition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched into a transphobic series of questions</a> related to gender, sex and sexuality. On the second day of Jackson’s hearings, the GOP’s <a href="https://twitter.com/GOP/status/1506282786843410432" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Twitter account</a> joined the scrum, posting a GIF with her face next to her initials — KBJ — which were then scratched out and replaced with “CRT,” referring to critical race theory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The GOP’s resistance did not end when the hearings did, either. Earlier this week, upon learning that three Republicans planned to support Jackson’s confirmation, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/05/new-red-scare-right-leans-into-pedophilia-accusations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed a baseless smear</a> that the offending senators were “pro-pedophile,” referring to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/19/sen-hawleys-misleading-attack-judge-jacksons-sentencing-child-porn-offenders/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">false allegations</a> that Jackson had taken a lax stance on sentencing people charged with crimes related to child pornography.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Such is the culture-war era we live in.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, in a sense, the Republican Party’s choice to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paint Jackson as an inherently bad person</a> pulls from a tried-and-true playbook that seeks to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fuel existing white fears</a> about perceived threats to the status quo. Indeed, Jackson’s grueling confirmation process wasn’t the first time Republicans have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-wont-support-sweeping-voting-rights-legislation-now-or-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used a Black bogeyman</a> to rile up their base. Thurgood Marshall, the first Black person to sit on the Supreme Court, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-jackson-crime-e20eb531b5ff3d17544a79d7db33cafd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced similar attacks</a> from Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats when he was nominated in 1967. But the barrage of questions that Jackson was forced to answer were still a far cry from her reputation as a federal judge who has garnered wide respect in legal circles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All this despite this seat being a relatively low-stakes one to fill. In terms of Supreme Court math, Jackson’s presence won’t change the outcome on the big, high-profile issues that politicians care about — the cases that have to do with abortion, gun rights, voting restrictions and so on. As we’ve written before, she’ll almost certainly be a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable liberal vote</a>, but she’s replacing another Democratic appointee, so the fundamental balance of the court will remain the same. There will still be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a six-justice conservative majority</a>, giving Republican appointees a lot of latitude to push the law to the right. Jackson, as the newest member of the three-justice liberal minority, will probably find herself writing a great deal of dissents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Going into Jackson’s confirmation hearings, it seemed possible that some Republicans might use it as an opportunity to put on a show of bipartisanship since they had little to lose. Instead, Jackson’s confirmation vote is just the latest sign that we have entered an era of such intense partisan polarization that Supreme Court nominees will be confirmed only if the president’s party controls the Senate.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Friday, Sarah Palin returned from the political wilderness <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sarah-palin-announces-campaign-congress/story?id=83822965" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by announcing a bid</a> for the U.S. House of Representatives, nearly 14 years since the then-governor of Alaska <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/us/politics/30veep.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered the national spotlight</a> as the Republican vice presidential nominee. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a curious reappearance, as Palin largely exited politics after her failed 2008 run with the late Sen. John McCain. She surprised many by then opting to not complete her term as governor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/us/politics/04palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigning in 2009</a> to then kickstart <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/sarah-palin-dumped-by-fox-119357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a media career</a>. And although she never <em>completely</em> abandoned national politics — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/us/politics/donald-trump-sarah-palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she backed former President Donald Trump</a> ahead of the 2016 presidential primary, had her own <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/sarah-palins-pac-burning-through-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political action committee</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sarahpalin/sarah-palin-decides-not-to-run-for-president-in-2012-idUSTRE7946V720111006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased campaigns</a> for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/02/palin-return-to-politics-alaska-00022555" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/sarah-palin-considering-2014-senate-bid-093929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate</a> — up until now, she hadn’t taken the leap to run for another office. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But now Palin has reentered the fray by running in the Aug. 16 special election for Alaska’s lone House seat, which sits vacant <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/03/18/alaska-us-rep-don-young-has-died-according-to-former-aides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the death</a> of longtime Republican Rep. Don Young. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The question now is: Can she win? The short answer is, quite possibly — but of course, we’re a long way from knowing. The push and pull of different factors, including Palin’s star power, controversial status and Alaska’s new electoral system, will make or break her comeback bid.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unquestionably, one of the biggest positives Palin has working in her favor is her high name recognition, both in Alaska and nationally. She is also relatively popular in GOP circles: A late January/early February poll from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/9uqg6clnvr/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov found</a> that 62 percent of Republicans across the country had a favorable view of Palin, compared with 23 percent who had an unfavorable view, for a net favorability of +39. That’s not nearly as rosy as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-receding-of-sarah-palin-in-one-chart/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">+80 net favorability she enjoyed among Republicans</a> around the time of her vice presidential bid, but it’s still objectively good news for Palin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that Palin is both well-known and popular among Republicans is a huge boon because it will make it easier for her to advance in Alaska’s June 11 primary, in which <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/candidatelistspecprim.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she will face nearly 50 other candidates</a>. That’s especially important in this election, too, as Alaska will use its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new electoral system</a> for <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/03/19/alaskas-first-ranked-choice-election-will-be-a-special-vote-to-replace-rep-don-young/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first time</a>: All candidates, regardless of party, will run together in the primary in which each voter will cast one vote, and the top-four vote-getters will advance to the Aug. 16 general election, where voters will pick Alaska’s next representative using ranked-choice voting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to know how the primary vote will be split among a candidate field this large, but given her name recognition in the state, Palin has a very good shot of at least finishing in the top-four. Moreover, it’s not just her notoriety working in her favor. Palin could also lock up conservative Republican support, given <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-endorses-palin-bid-alaskas-sole-house-seat-83869341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump has endorsed her</a> in a state he carried by 10 percentage points <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=2&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2020</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a lot working against her, too. For starters, Palin might be well-known, but she’s not a beloved figure in Alaska. Consider an October 2021 poll from Alaska Survey Research that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/02/palin-return-to-politics-alaska-00022555" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found that only 31 percent</a> of registered voters in Alaska had a favorable view of her. Even more troubling for Palin is that this was identical to ASR’s finding in an <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/412324-poll-palin-unpopular-in-alaska-following-jab-at-murkowski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2018 survey</a> of likely midterm voters. It’s possible, in other words, that Palin might be the first choice for many conservative Republicans in the state, but she may struggle to win many second-choice votes beyond this part of the GOP. It also doesn’t point to her ability to easily build a winning ranked-choice coalition in the general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is also the possibility that despite her conservative bona fides, Palin will not necessarily corner that faction of the Republican base — or even the general election, as more than one Republican could advance from the primary. Already three other high-profile GOP contenders have emerged: state Sen. Joshua Revak, <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2022/03/21/colleagues-opponents-remember-rep-don-young/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a former aide to Young</a>; Tara Sweeney, an <a href="https://uaf.edu/anlc/languages/inupiaq.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iñupiat</a> who <a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/tara-sweeneys-tenure-was-a-gentle-snow-a-fierce-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">served in Trump’s administration</a>; and Nick Begich III, a member of the high-profile (but mostly Democratic) <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/10/22/nick-begich-republican-son-of-alaskas-leading-democratic-family-will-run-for-us-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska political family</a>. Begich <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-house-republicans-who-voted-for-bidens-infrastructure-bill-could-face-serious-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already running against Young</a> before the congressman died, so he <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/03/26/an-array-of-alaska-politicians-ponder-bids-in-the-absolute-jungle-of-elections-to-replace-us-rep-don-young/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have a bit of a head start</a> in attracting support across the state. Additionally, former state Sen. John Coghill is running, too, although the former state Senate majority leader <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2020/09/02/recount-upholds-14-vote-primary-loss-for-longtime-incumbent-state-sen-john-coghill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly lost renomination</a> in his 2020 primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first glance, it seems likely that a Republican wins the special election, given the red lean of the state and the Republican-leaning political environment. However, Alaska is also a weird state politically, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lisa-murkowski-wins-alaska-senate-race-joe-miller/story?id=12164212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with something</a> of an <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/bill-walker-alaska-governors-race-2014-sean-parnell-112922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent streak</a>. After all, 58 percent of Alaska registered voters <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/statistics/2022/APR/VOTERS%20BY%20PARTY%20AND%20PRECINCT.htm#STATEWIDE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not identify with a political party</a>, among the <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/registering-by-party-where-the-democrats-and-republicans-are-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest in the country</a>. So we shouldn’t necessarily discount the Democrats and independents running, especially since it’s the state’s first use of a top-four primary and ranked-choice voting in a general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For its part, the Alaska Democratic Party is <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/04/04/alaskas-us-house-race-includes-48-candidates-and-a-lot-of-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lining up behind</a> Anchorage Assembly member Chris Constant, although other notable Democrats are running, including state Rep. Adam Wool; former state Rep. Mary Sattler Peltola, a <a href="https://alaska.si.edu/culture_ne_siberian.asp?subculture=Yupik%20(Asiatic%20Eskimo)&amp;continue=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yup’ik Eskimo</a>; and <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2021/11/08/ancsa-leader-notti-inducted-into-native-american-hall-fame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indigenous activist</a> Emil Notti, an 89-year old <a href="https://www.uaf.edu/anlc/languages/koyukon.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koyukon Athabascan</a> who lost to Young <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/Archive/73SPEC/73specreturns.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 1973 special election</a> for this seat. Meanwhile, a handful of independent (“nonpartisan” or “undeclared” in Alaska parlance) candidates are also running: Al Gross, an independent who <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=2&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost the 2020 U.S. Senate race</a> as the Democratic nominee; former Republican state Rep. Andrew Halcro; former Alaska assistant attorney general and garden columnist Jeff Lowenfels; and even a <a href="https://www.northpolealaska.com/citycouncil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Pole</a> city councilor <a href="https://mustreadalaska.com/do-santa-claus-or-sarah-palin-have-a-shot-at-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who changed his name to Santa Claus</a>. Did we mention there are a <em>lot</em> of candidates?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s been no public polling of the special primary yet, but we do have one data point on the special general election that includes Palin: A Change Research poll funded by 314 Action Fund, which <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/314-action-fund/C00633248/independent-expenditures/2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent heavily to boost Gross’s campaign</a> in 2020, <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21574833/ak-314-action-toplines-march-25-29-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found Palin and Gross running neck and neck</a> at around 35 percent after respondents’ choices were reallocated via ranked-choice voting. To be sure, the poll only included four candidates: Palin, Gross, Revak and one other Republican who ultimately chose not to run, but even so, the poll does illustrate how Palin could win in a ranked-choice general election. At the same time, though, it underscores how ranked-choice voting could make for an incredibly close contest, possibly because of Palin’s poor standing among Alaska voters writ large.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One last wrinkle in the Alaska race is that the special general election will coincide with the regular primary for the November general election, which means we will find out who won the special election at the same time as we discover which four candidates advanced to the regular general election. Most of the high-profile contenders, including Palin, <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/candidatelistprim.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have filed</a> or say they <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-news/2022/04/palin-files-paperwork-to-run-in-alaska-us-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intend to file</a> for the regular contest (they have until June 1 to do so). In other words, most of the major candidates will essentially be campaigning for two elections at once in the coming months. Still, at least a few notable names — <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/03/29/former-state-sen-john-coghill-enters-race-for-alaska-us-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coghill</a>, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/alaska/articles/2022-04-01/list-of-candidates-for-alaska-us-house-seat-tops-35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halcro</a> and <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/03/30/alaskas-us-house-candidate-field-expands-as-friday-deadline-nears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notti</a>, for instance — only plan to run in the special, so it’s not out of the question that the special election winner will not be among the candidates who advance to the regular general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the first woman on a GOP presidential ticket, Palin has already made history. Palin was the second woman to ever run for vice president on one of the two major parties’ national tickets, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, and it’s possible that’s not all Palin will end up having in common with Ferraro. Ferraro also lost her vice presidential campaign and then years later <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-11-18-vw-286-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sought to make a political comeback</a>, running for New York’s U.S. Senate seat in 1992. But Ferraro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/01/nyregion/abrams-gets-a-concession-from-ferraro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came up short in that race</a>, losing by less than 1 point in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/fallout-from-92-senate-primary-leaves-careers-of-3-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ugly Democratic primary</a>; she also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces98/stories/apny091698.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mounted another unsuccessful Senate bid</a> in 1998 where she lost the primary by a much larger margin. How Palin’s comeback plays out remains to be seen — it’s definitely possible that Palin is victorious, but it’s also not without risks, as Ferraro knew all too well.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The U.S. House of Representatives isn’t the only chamber whose district lines are being redrawn to reflect the 2020 census. State-legislative chambers are being redistricted too — and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-democrats-win-full-control-of-more-state-governments-than-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we’ve written in the past</a>, state legislatures are often where the laws that have the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-republicans-and-democrats-are-doing-in-the-states-where-they-have-total-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest impact on people’s daily lives</a> are passed. In the last year, state legislatures have passed numerous new <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election laws</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion restrictions</a>, <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pduAa/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-transgender laws</a> and more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The book isn’t closed on legislative redistricting quite yet — <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C2Eto4eAHYwMT8sLXN03HUbOZICLCx8TGAX0RSI1YKE/pub?hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;output=html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven states</a> still don’t have new maps — but one trend is already clear: Just as congressional redistricting is producing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer swing districts</a>, very few state-legislative chambers <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/redistricting-continues-to-hurt-competition-in-state-legislatures?link_id=25&amp;can_id=5f27a3767bd4756f5c4ec89f31b71bbe&amp;source=email-this-week-in-statehouse-action-winter-blues-edition&amp;email_referrer=email_1432225&amp;email_subject=this-week-in-statehouse-action-winter-blues-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be competitive this decade</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we wouldn’t expect solidly Republican or solidly Democratic states to have competitive legislatures no matter how their maps are drawn, so we’ll only be focusing on battleground states in this article. But according to our analysis of state-legislative redistricting (using the same tools we use to analyze congressional redistricting on our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting tracker</a>), as well as conversations with experts in state-legislative elections, the legislatures in even many battleground states have been drawn to give one party a clear advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That is not a new development, but we also found that redistricting changed the electoral calculus in several battleground states: Some legislative chambers got more competitive, while other previously contested chambers got sewn up for one party. So join us for an all-expenses-paid tour through all the state capitols you might (rightly or wrongly) expect to be up for grabs this decade.</p>



<h2><strong>Uncompetitive legislatures both before and after redistricting</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">First up: a trio of swing states whose legislatures have nonetheless been safely Republican for years — and figure to remain so for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Georgia</strong> is perhaps the most egregious example. Although President Biden narrowly won the Peach State in 2020, a majority of districts in the new state Senate (32 out of 56) and state House (94 out of 180) are solidly Republican (which we define as having a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, designed for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;

The Wisconsin Supreme Court, which took charge of choosing the new maps after the Republican legislature and Democratic governor failed to come to an agreement, has already decided to pick maps with <a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-supreme-court-sides-with-gop-proposal-for-least-change-approach-to-redistricting/article_bc518113-3caa-510a-96e8-567ce095b295.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as few deviations as possible</a> from last decade’s plans.</p>



<h2><strong>Legislatures that got less competitive in redistricting</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also a couple battleground states where the legislature <em>has</em> been competitive in recent elections, but are no longer in play after this round of redistricting. For example, the median seat in the <strong>Texas</strong> state House used to have a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+7 — 5 points bluer than the state’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall partisan lean of R+12</a>. Now, though, the median seat has a partisan lean of R+16 — 4 points redder than the state and safely out of reach for state Democrats in most years.</p>

<h2><strong>Legislatures that got more competitive in redistricting</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Never fear, however — there are still some state-legislative chambers that will be competitive this decade. In fact, redistricting even made a handful of chambers <em>more</em> competitive, thanks largely to redistricting commissions and court intervention. For example, back in 2011, <strong>Michigan</strong> Republicans had unfettered control over redistricting and <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/maps-show-how-gerrymandering-benefitted-michigan-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drew state Senate and House maps designed to keep themselves in power</a>. And it worked: Thanks to median seats 8 and 11 points redder than the state as a whole (according to partisan lean), Republicans held onto both chambers throughout the decade even as Democrats won the Senate popular vote in 2018 and the House popular vote in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTxxrLQlnrEl9ocgwUM7EL4PasH-5lmyf7sttn2GSMg/edit#gid=235559234" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012, 2014, 2018 and 2020</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, in 2018, Michigan voters passed a ballot measure creating an independent redistricting commission, and the maps passed by the commission are dramatically fairer. The median-seat bias now favors Republicans by 1 point in the Senate and 3 points in the House; the efficiency gaps of both maps also significantly decreased. As a result, Democrats now have a realistic shot at a House majority for the first time since 2011 and a Senate majority for the first time since <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/blog/on-this-day-in-1984-senate-republicans-seize-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1984</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, there are legislatures that were competitive before this round of redistricting and remain so after. It may not be the first state that comes to mind when you think “swing state,” but <strong>Maine</strong> has one of the most competitive legislatures in the country. Although it’s a light blue state overall, both the state Senate and state House have small Republican median-seat biases. As a result, the tipping-point district in each chamber falls squarely in the “highly competitive” camp. With Democrats currently in control of both chambers, this will be a top GOP pickup target in 2022.</p>

Because of the delayed release of the 2020 census, the 2021 elections — which surprisingly saw Republicans take control of the chamber — were conducted under Virginia’s old state House map, which had a slight GOP bias (an R+4 efficiency gap and R+3 median-seat bias). However, under the new map (which was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/12/28/virginia-redistricting-final-maps-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drawn by a pair of bipartisan experts</a>), the median seat almost exactly matches the state’s D+5 partisan lean. On paper, the Virginia state Senate is a tougher climb for Republicans (with a median seat about 3 points bluer than the state as a whole), but Fiddler at Daily Kos said she’s still keeping the chamber on her radar.</p>

(The maps’ efficiency gaps are also <em>just</em> shy of the D+8 threshold that would suggest a severe gerrymander.) But because Nevada is still a slightly Republican-leaning state overall, this won’t be enough to put the chamber totally out of Republicans’ reach.</p>

The state’s independent redistricting commission drew a legislative map (the Arizona Senate and House use the same map, with each district electing one senator and two representatives) with a modest GOP bias: The new median seat is about 2 points redder than the state as a whole. However, that still gives the median seat a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+9, which would be difficult for Democrats to win — at least in another state. But Arizona is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving left at a fairly rapid pace</a>, so perhaps 2020 performance is the more relevant metric here — and the median seat on the new map voted for former President Donald Trump by less than 1 percentage point.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, CNalysis’s Nuttycombe identified two other chambers that will probably be perennially competitive this decade: the New Hampshire state House and the Alaska state House. But it’s hard to put numbers on them: The <strong>New Hampshire</strong> state House has 400 districts, some of which are nested within each other and/or elect multiple members. According to Fiddler, that makes it unpredictable, but it’s expected to retain its bouncy tendencies (since before the 2018 election, it has gone from a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_011018_26973.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">218-175 Republican majority</a> to a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_2020_April%201.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">234-162 Democratic majority</a> to a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/elections/Legis_Control_2-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">213-187 Republican majority</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the district lines of the <strong>Alaska</strong> state House aren’t even complete yet, as the Alaska Supreme Court last month <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/03/25/alaska-supreme-court-finds-anchorage-state-senate-map-is-unconstitutional-political-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered certain districts to be redrawn</a>. But the final map may not matter much anyway. The reason the Alaska House is competitive isn’t the election results; <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_House_of_Representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1994</a>, Republicans have always won a majority of districts in this red state. It’s that, for the last six years, some moderate Republicans and independents have <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2016/11/09/alaska-senate-will-remain-under-republican-control-for-the-next-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen to vote with Democrats</a> to give them de facto control of the chamber. So the battle for control of the Alaska House in 2022 and beyond will likely be won or lost in GOP primaries and in the backrooms of Juneau.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While some other chambers could get suspenseful in a wave election, that is the extent of those that will be regularly contested, according to the experts we talked to. In other words, only about 20 out of the nation’s 99 state-legislative chambers<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nebraska Legislature has only one chamber, which is why there aren’t 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> look like they could be genuinely competitive this decade. While a lot of that is due to underlying partisan polarization, biased maps contribute to the problem in at least eight chambers as well. A lack of fair maps is not just a problem on the congressional level.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Is the Republican tent big enough to include both Reps. Liz Cheney and Madison Cawthorn? Or might the two of them be on the outs come fall? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cheney is facing one of the toughest primaries in the country after voting to impeach former President Donald Trump for his role encouraging supporters to raid the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Cawthorn, on the other hand, is all-in on Trump’s vision for the Republican Party — and then some. Last week, after Cawthorn <a href="https://twitter.com/patriottakes/status/1508127124498141187?s=20&amp;t=SstXpFI41o2zE_WAaWj3dA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested his colleagues</a> in Washington, D.C., host orgies and use cocaine, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he’d lost trust in Cawthorn and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, from Cawthorn’s home state of North Carolina, endorsed Cawthorn’s primary challenger.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew discusses how these two primaries serve as a test of what the Republican Party and its voters will and won’t accept. They also try to get to the bottom of whether Americans support the “Parental Rights In Education Bill” — or what its critics call the “Don’t Say Gay Bill” — which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last week. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Despite being a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/liz-cheney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable Republican vote</a> for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/liz-cheney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of two-plus terms</a> in the U.S. House, Rep. Liz Cheney hasn’t been afraid to buck her party when it comes to former President Donald Trump. The Wyoming representative was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of just 10 House Republicans</a> who voted to impeach Trump in January 2021. She <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/10/07/wyoming-voters-liz-cheney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has called Trump</a> a “clear and present danger” to American democracy. She supported the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol that Trump incited. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/us/politics/cheneys-jan-6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheney has even</a> earned praise <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/165776/liz-cheney-reelection-democrats-odd-bedfellows-neoconservatism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Democrats</a>, a remarkable turn of events for the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/political-rehabilitation-dick-cheney-courtesy-000100847.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whom Democrats loathed</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Cheney’s anti-Trump stance <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-voters-say-they-dont-mind-trump-critics-but-liz-cheneys-ouster-says-otherwise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could doom her career in the Republican Party</a> — where <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump remains popular</a> — by sparking intense opposition to her both at home and in Washington. On Capitol Hill, House Republicans ousted Cheney from party leadership and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/02/03/rnc-cheney-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican National Committee voted to condemn her</a> for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/02/liz-cheney-vice-chair-capitol-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serving on the House committee</a> investigating the events of Jan. 6. In Wyoming, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-liz-cheney-ousted-wyoming-gop/story?id=81206853" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state GOP has excommunicated her</a>, while party committees all around the state <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/laramie-county-gop-votes-censure-181600977.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have formally censured her</a>. And now she faces a stern challenge in Wyoming’s 2022 GOP primary — the state has only one congressional district — from Harriett Hageman, an attorney and former RNC member who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/09/politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-cheney-challenger/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has endorsements from both Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/kevin-mccarthy-harriet-hageman-endorsement/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Cheney may face more danger in her primary <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-but-one-house-republican-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-faces-a-trump-endorsed-challenger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than any other House Republican running in 2022</a>. But could she be saved by … Democrats? On March 8, <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/crossover-voting-will-remain-in-wyoming-after-party-affiliation-bill-dies-in-legislature/article_bf81046f-2e79-5d27-bb1d-e1bce76aa84a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wyoming’s legislature scrapped a bill</a> seeking to end the state’s “crossover voting” provision. That rule <a href="https://www.natronacounty-wy.gov/Faq.aspx?QID=126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permits voters to switch parties on Election Day</a>, which could allow registered Democrats and other non-Republicans to change their registration to support Cheney in the Aug. 16 GOP primary. The legislature’s deliberations over the bill, which <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/donald-trump-backs-legislation-to-end-crossover-voting-in-wyoming/article_8dcb04c8-e217-5f8d-92ff-9ef8f40a0ba2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump had supported</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-liz-cheney-republican-primary-crossover-voting-election-laws-2022-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparked a raft</a> of headlines <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/liz-cheneys-re-election-prospects-doubt-national-profile-grows-rcna17265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising the prospect</a> of crossover voters <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/597511-wyoming-legislature-kills-crossover-voting-ban-despite-trumps-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being key</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-backed-wyoming-elections-bill-fails-to-pass-in-boon-to-liz-cheney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheney’s survival</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is otherwise: Only Republicans can really save Cheney’s political future. If <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/09/us/politics/liz-cheney-wyoming-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she’s counting</a> on <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/14/liz-cheney-democrats-wyoming-00016905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anyone else</a>, then she’s probably done for.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The math just doesn’t work for Cheney if she’s looking for substantial help from non-Republicans in Wyoming’s GOP primary without winning a healthy share of Republicans first. The vast majority (<a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/VRStats/2022/22MarVR_stats.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent</a>) of voters in the state are registered Republicans. And in midterm years (like 2022), an even larger share of the state’s primary voters have cast ballots in GOP nomination battles, as the table below shows — meaning they’re very likely reliably Republican-leaning Wyomingites. And of course, in a state as red as Wyoming — Trump <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=56&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garnered 70 percent of the vote</a> there in 2020 — winning the GOP primary is tantamount to winning the election in November.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s look at what happened in 2018, when almost 100,000 more votes were cast in the Republican primary than in the Democratic contest. Although a <a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/local_news/poll-friess-gordon-in-dead-heat-in-wyoming-gop-governor-race/article_d0f4bfca-a0ca-11e8-accc-bb7d34156640.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super-competitive GOP nomination race for governor</a> partly explains that discrepancy,<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hageman actually &lt;a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/2018/Results/Primary/2018_Statewide_Candidates_Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;finished third in that race&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a> the 2018 cycle marked the third consecutive midterm in which more than 80 percent of the votes cast in the two major-party primaries came on the GOP side. Now, some of those voters might be Democrats or independents who vote in the GOP primary because it will determine the winner in most Wyoming elections. But in a state where the Republican presidential nominee <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?year=2020&amp;fips=56&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;type=state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually wins 65 to 70 percent of the vote</a>, it’s clear that <em>most</em> of those primary voters are dyed-in-the-wool Republicans or at least lean toward the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s do a little back-of-the-envelope math to consider Cheney’s position based on what we know about the current state of the race and recent Wyoming primaries. There has been little recent public polling of the race, but <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mq0hidvbl0dklfm/PollingProfessor-MemoFiveRaceSynopsis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a December survey from SoCo Strategies</a> put her behind Hageman by 20 percentage points, and older polls found <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/cheney-in-trouble-77-gop-would-not-reelect-53-call-her-liberal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her support</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1420482244334952448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorability among Wyoming Republicans</a> in the 20s — evidence that she’s in rough shape. For argument’s sake, let’s say that Cheney trails by 10 points among registered Republicans in the final days of the primary campaign (possibly a rosy scenario, considering her polling numbers). So Hagerman has 50 percent, Cheney 40 percent and the four or so other candidates attract the remaining 10 percent (<a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/2022/2022_Key_Election_Dates.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the candidate filing deadline</a> is May 27, so the field could expand or retract further). If there are around 110,000 voters who were registered Republicans <em>before</em> primary day — a reasonable guess since nearly 117,000 total voters participated in the 2018 GOP primary for governor<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That total includes crossover voters and, as will be discussed below, new registrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> — Hageman would lead by around 11,000 votes. Based on the 2018 primary, Cheney would then need nearly 60 percent of the total Democratic primary voters to not only switch to vote in the GOP contest but to also vote for her.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, if the race proved to be closer, and/or if another GOP contender — say, state Sen. Anthony Bouchard — took more of the anti-Cheney vote from Hageman, <em>perhaps</em> crossover voters could make the difference for Cheney. Let’s say Hageman is up, with 42 percent to Cheney’s 37 percent among registered Republicans, while Bouchard sits at 15 percent (and other candidates win the remaining 6 percent). In that case, Cheney would trail by about 5,500 votes, or about 30 percent of the total number of Democratic primary votes in 2018. It’s not out of the question that the red-hot spotlight on Cheney’s race could encourage significant crossover voting among Democrats, especially if there isn’t much happening in the Democratic primary. Things could play out that way, considering so far <a href="https://www.thegreenpapers.com/G22/WY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no notable Democrats have declared</a> in Wyoming’s races <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/WY/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the House</a> or <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/new-candidate-announces-bid-for-governor/article_43b18b59-330e-5186-87ba-6739f5f48107.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor</a> (neither of Wyoming’s U.S. Senate seats <a href="https://www.270towin.com/2022-senate-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are up in 2022</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this still means that Cheney must remain competitive among Republicans to even allow for a scenario where crossover voters could conceivably put her over the top. Granted, she has a huge financial edge — at the end of 2021, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6WY00159/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheney had raised $7.2 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2WY00166/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hageman’s $745,000</a> — which the incumbent can use to damage Hageman and play up her conserative bonafides. And Cheney’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitt-romney-american-democracy-extraordinary-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealthy backers</a> might also look to <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreyvs/status/1503412537391525889?s=20&amp;t=cA6y1UeX0yln3UiyZ34ozQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise the profile</a> of one of the other anti-Cheney contenders in the hopes of fragmenting her opposition. (Promoting another candidate for your benefit is a dark campaign art practiced by <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/todd-akin-missouri-claire-mccaskill-2012-121262/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past vulnerable incumbents</a>, although usually by trying to influence the <em>other</em> party’s primary.) However, even if Cheney’s allies wanted to go that route, the <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/the-cheney-challenger-lurking-on?s=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most obvious choice</a> for prospective assistance looks to be toxic: Bouchard, the state senator, has seen his <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2022/02/01/bouchards-campaign-donations-slow-again-in-latest-quarter-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising dry up</a> after Hageman’s entry into the race and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/us/politics/anthony-bouchard-14-year-old.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revelations that he impregnated a 14-year-old girl</a> when he was 18 years old.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond any hypothetical campaign intrigue, the fact is that Wyoming’s Election Day registration rules may not even boost Cheney’s chances as much as the conventional wisdom might believe. Wyoming not only permits voters to switch parties at the polls, but it also <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows same-day voter registration</a>. So while crossover voters might participate in the GOP primary, there could be even more same-day registrants, many of whom might be newly engaged Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider the 2018 GOP primary for governor, when <a href="https://wyofile.com/friess-suggests-election-law-change-following-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some conservatives claimed</a> that now-Gov. Mark Gordon won the party nomination thanks to crossover votes from non-Republicans. Gordon won by about 9,000 votes, but an <a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/local_news/crossover-voting-had-little-impact-on-wyo-primary-election-study-shows/article_c74d954e-b71f-11e8-8f4e-3355c6638aec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis of voter registration data</a> found that party switching probably didn’t affect the outcome. The GOP added around 8,200 registered voters on primary day, but Democrats lost only about 1,800 registrants, while independents and other third-party registrations dropped by about 2,700 voters. That meant that a plurality of new Republican voters came from fresh registrants rather than party-switching, as about 3,700 new voters joined the rolls (mostly with the GOP). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thinking about the 2022 GOP primary, there’s no guarantee that same-day Republican registrants are going to be favorably inclined toward Cheney; they may be predisposed to oppose her, in fact.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that gets back to the fundamental truth for Cheney: Her political future rests on winning over Republican voters rather than winning over Democratic or independent voters. She needs a good deal of the former for the latter to matter at all.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Thursday was supposed to be opening day of the 2022 Major League Baseball season, but it was delayed a week (to next Thursday, April 7) by a <a href="https://www.vox.com/22967489/mlb-lockout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contentious labor dispute</a> between players and team owners that lasted much of the winter. The MLB lockout left fans feeling frustrated — especially with team owners — and, they claim, less interested in the sport. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll stop root-root-rooting for the home team. And that holds a lesson even for those who aren’t baseball fans: Be skeptical when a poll says an issue will make people more or less likely to do something (like, say, vote a certain way).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, some background: At the end of Dec. 1, the collective bargaining agreement that governed MLB players’ relationship with their employers (i.e., the 30 MLB teams) expired. In response, the team owners <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/32761620/mlb-mlbpa-fail-reach-new-labor-agreement-league-issues-lockout-first-1990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented a lockout</a> (essentially the management version of a strike) preventing the players from going to work<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baseball season was over by this point, so the lockout didn’t immediately cancel any games, but players still couldn’t sign new contracts with teams, work out at team facilities or even talk to their former employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> until the owners and the players union reached a new agreement. For the next few months, the two sides slowly negotiated everything from specific rule changes to the biggest bone of contention, player salaries. Eventually, on March 10, they <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33399466/mlb-mlbpa-reach-labor-agreement-everything-need-know-lockout-ends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to a new deal</a>, but not before the first several games of the season were called off. (They have now been rescheduled for later in the year.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to two polls conducted just before the lockout ended, fans generally sided with the players in the dispute. Forty-five percent of self-identified MLB fans told <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/08/mlb-lockout-blame-cba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> that the owners were most responsible for the two sides’ failure to agree, while only 21 percent said the players were most responsible. Similarly, a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/lat-mlb-lockout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey/Los Angeles Times poll</a> found that 31 percent of MLB fans blamed the owners most for the lockout, while only 12 percent blamed the players most (however, 49 percent said they blamed both sides equally). According to SurveyMonkey/the Los Angeles Times, fans agreed, 65 percent to 26 percent, that the players were negotiating in good faith, but fans narrowly <em>dis</em>agreed that the owners were doing so, 49 percent to 42 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, in past labor disputes, fans generally sided with MLB owners. For example, during the notorious 1994-95 strike (which canceled the 1994 World Series), an <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/study/31094757/questions#ce244979-2faa-4e04-b4f8-b0917257be4c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll</a> found that 45 percent of fans held the players more responsible and only 27 percent held the owners more responsible (while 24 percent volunteered that both sides were equally responsible). Why the reversal? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one thing, in a very literal sense, the owners were responsible for the recent lockout: They didn’t have to implement it (legally, the business of MLB could have continued under the old collective bargaining agreement while a new one was being negotiated), but they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/mlb-lockout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose to do so to gain leverage over the players</a>. In addition, owners reportedly pulled a fast one on the players at times during negotiations, such as <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/03/02/mlb-lockout-ross-stripling-criticizes-owners-negotiation-tactics-cba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inserting new provisions into a proposal at the last minute</a> and <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/02/04/mlb-told-mlbpa-it-wont-provide-counter-offer-lockout-negotiations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refusing to make a counterproposal after saying they would</a>. Media coverage of the lockout was also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/03/08/baseball-lockout-media-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more sympathetic to the players</a>, both explicitly and implicitly by highlighting how much wealthier the owners are than the players and how the players’ share of MLB’s revenue has <a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-mlbpa-has-a-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped in recent years</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of whom they blamed, though, fans weren’t happy during the lockout. Forty-six percent told Morning Consult they were “frustrated,” and 75 percent told SurveyMonkey/the Los Angeles Times that they agreed that the main issue in the lockout was “greed, not baseball.” And 60 percent of fans in the SurveyMonkey/Los Angeles Times poll said that the dispute had caused them to lose interest in the 2022 baseball season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You might expect that last number to set off alarm bells in MLB headquarters (and maybe it did — these polls, or at least the sentiments expressed in them, could help explain why a new agreement was signed just a few days later). But later on in the same poll, a plurality of fans also said the lockout probably wouldn’t affect how much time or money they spent on baseball this year. Fifty percent of fans said they would attend about the same number of games that they would have if there hadn’t been a lockout, 49 percent said they would watch about the same number of games, and 47 percent said they would buy about the same amount of merchandise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Granted, a healthy minority of fans — 32 to 36 percent — said they would do these things less because of the lockout, but since the poll was taken while the lockout was still going on, some fans may have assumed that the lockout would cancel a good chunk of the season, if not all of it. (In a separate question, only 59 percent of respondents predicted that the lockout would be resolved by Memorial Day.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even those who assumed baseball would be back quickly may have been using this question to express their displeasure with the dispute. We’ll have to wait until the end of the season to check attendance, viewership and revenue numbers to know for sure, but the smart bet is probably that the lockout won’t significantly harm MLB’s bottom line.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a popular perception that the 1994-95 strike damaged baseball’s standing, but if it did, the effect was temporary. Long-term trends in &lt;a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/misc.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;game attendance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/22240/nearly-half-americans-baseball-fans.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;percentage of Americans calling themselves baseball fans&lt;/a&gt; have been steady. Regardless, of course, there’s a big difference between a strike that canceled &lt;a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/nationals/mlb-work-stoppages-history-lockouts-strikes-baseball" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;948 games&lt;/a&gt; and a lockout that ultimately canceled none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>17</sup></a> You see, polling questions like this are a honeytrap for political analysts, too. Pollsters routinely ask people whether certain <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/poll-trump-supporters-immigration-2016-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy stances</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/14/poll-biden-black-vp-185043" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political decisions</a> or <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/data-points/poll-more-voters-say-trump-doesn-t-respect-women-after-n663296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandals</a> will make them more or less likely to vote for a politician, but these questions should <a href="https://twitter.com/aedwardslevy/status/1034859763815907335?s=20&amp;t=jZQcrWxF8RwLp2xHQ-UYqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rarely be taken literally</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because respondents themselves rarely take the question literally, instead using it as an opportunity to register their feelings about the stance, decision, scandal or politician in question. For example, according to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/327007811/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-10-3-10-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey/NBC News poll</a> from back in 2016, 39 percent of likely voters said that the “Access Hollywood” tape would make them less likely to support Donald Trump for president. But that included 65 percent of Democrats — few of whom ever had any likelihood of supporting Trump anyway. Among Republicans — i.e., a group that <em>was</em> inclined to support Trump before the tape’s release — only 12 percent said the tape made them less likely to support him, while 81 percent said it made no difference. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2019-12/topline-538-ipsos-impeachment_-wave-2-120419.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos/FiveThirtyEight poll</a> from 2019 illustrates how this can apply to nonelectoral questions, too. In it, 38 percent of Americans said that Trump’s impeachment hearings had made them more likely to believe he committed an impeachable offense; only 20 percent said it made them less likely to believe it. But 95 percent of those who said the hearings made them more likely to believe Trump committed an impeachable offense <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-impeachment-hearings-just-confirmed-voters-preexisting-opinions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>already believed that he had</em></a>. And an identical 95 percent of those who said the hearings made them less likely to believe it <em>already believed that he was innocent</em>.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These types of questions are really relevant only among the subset of respondents whose minds are genuinely not made up — and even then, you’re putting a lot of trust in them to accurately predict their future behavior. (For instance, Trump did <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dip in the polls</a> after the “Access Hollywood” tape was released — but he recovered a few weeks later, suggesting that voters put aside their misgivings with the tape because they found another reason to vote for Trump.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And sure, maybe MLB fans’ game-watching habits are more malleable than partisans’ political beliefs, but sports fandom can inspire people to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2022/03/12/sports-fans-more-violent-abusive-since-returning-after-worst-covid/6986397001/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do extreme things</a> and <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/sport/fans-judge-cheats-when-it-suits-them-1.544451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twist themselves up in logical knots</a>, just like partisanship. There’s a reason that sports fandom and political fanaticism are <a href="https://www.newswise.com/politics/study-draws-connections-between-sports-fandom-and-political-tribalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often</a> <a href="https://theconversation.com/voters-are-starting-to-act-like-hard-core-sports-fans-with-dangerous-repercussions-for-democracy-153175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Will Smith’s net favorability rating among Americans has fallen by 30 percentage points after he slapped Chris Rock at the 94th Academy Awards last weekend, according to <a href="https://civicscience.com/majority-of-u-s-adults-side-with-chris-rock/">a March 27 poll from CivicScience</a>. (If you’ve been living under a rock: Smith attacked Rock after Rock <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/oscars-2022-smith-apologizes-acceptance-speech-chris-rock-83712905">made a joke about Smith’s wife</a>, Jada Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia.) CivicScience, which has been tracking Smith’s favorability ratings weekly since 2011, found Smith’s net favorability — the share who have a favorable view of Smith minus the share who have an unfavorable view — dropping from +50 points to +20 points post-slap. Seventy-eight percent of Americans sided with Rock, according to this poll, while 61 percent said in <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/entertainment/articles-reports/2022/03/28/will-smith-was-wrong-hit-chris-rock">a March 28 YouGov poll</a> that what Smith did was wrong.</li><li>The share of Americans supporting Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme Court seems relatively unchanged by her confirmation hearings, though some Americans may have gone from being undecided to opposing her confirmation. A March 25-27 <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/28/ketanji-brown-jackson-confirmation-support-polling/">poll from Morning Consult/Politico</a> found that 47 percent of registered voters thought that the Senate should vote to confirm Jackson, while a March 26-29 <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/3ixnq9227y/econTabReport.pdf">poll from The Economist/YouGov</a> showed 43 percent support among Americans. Those numbers are similar to Jackson’s support in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-broadly-want-the-senate-to-confirm-ketanji-brown-jackson-to-the-supreme-court/">our analysis of polls conducted prior to the hearings</a>. When compared with their previous polls, the share of respondents who had “no opinion” or were “not sure” dropped by 7 percentage points in both polls. The Morning Consult/Politico poll also found that opposition to Jackson’s confirmation rose by 7 points, but The Economist/YouGov survey found basically no change in opposition.</li><li>Views of American leadership have dramatically improved across almost all NATO countries, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391160/image-improves-across-nato.aspx">a Gallup poll</a> conducted in February but before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Compared to 2020, 26 of the 27 countries polled had a more favorable view of U.S. leadership. The greatest increases came from Portugal (52 percentage points), the Netherlands (45 points) and Norway (42 points). The only country with lower approval of U.S. leadership was Lithuania, where favorability decreased by 6 points.</li><li>A strong majority of Americans (77 percent) supported the CDC’s decision to relax social distancing and face mask guidelines in areas with low rates of COVID-19, according to a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_032822.pdf/">March 10-14 poll</a> from <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_032822/">Monmouth University</a>. Additionally, 62 percent thought that face mask and social distancing guidelines should not be instituted in their state currently, while 55 percent opposed requirements to show proof of vaccination to do in-person work. But a majority of Americans seemed fine with changing these guidelines as the situation changes — 50 percent said they preferred for the government to continue adjusting guidelines and mandates, while 34 percent said they wanted no guidelines and 14 percent said they wanted the government to settle on something consistent.</li><li>Americans are growing increasingly concerned about Russia’s nuclear weapons and global influence, according to <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/concerns-about-nuclear-weapons/">a March 17-21 poll from the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>. Seventy-one percent of Americans said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had increased the likelihood of nuclear weapons being used anywhere in the world, with the majority saying that this made them extremely or very concerned about Ukraine (61 percent) or other European countries (50 percent) being potential targets. Compared with a February poll taken just prior to the invasion, the share of Americans in the more recent poll who were extremely or very concerned that Russia’s influence around the world posed a direct threat to the United States rose 11 percentage points, to 64 percent.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past year, many Republicans have repeatedly claimed that education has run amok under Democratic control and that parents need more say in the classroom. There have been debates over school closures, masking, transgender students competing in school sports, and how teachers talk about race, gender and sexuality.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional redistricting</a> — the process of redrawing the nation’s 435 congressional districts to reflect the results of the 2020 census — is not quite finished, but it’s getting darn close. Only four states (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/missouri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missouri</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire</a>) have yet to approve new maps (though the maps in several states are currently being challenged in court, so some states that <em>have</em> approved new maps could see those maps overturned — as happened in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a> just last week).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So while some of the specific numbers will change, we now have a good sense of what the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-countless-confusing-sometimes-contradictory-takeaways-of-the-2021-22-redistricting-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big-picture takeaway</a> from this redistricting cycle will be. No matter which way you slice it, Democrats have gained blue seats from the mapmaking process, making the House playing field between the two parties more balanced than it has been in decades. But that doesn’t mean the 2022 congressional map should be considered “fair.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the maps stand on March 30 at 5 p.m. Eastern, 175 congressional districts have a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> of D+5 or bluer, 181 have a partisan lean of R+5 or redder and 33 are in the “highly competitive” category between D+5 and R+5. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1070" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/redistricting-2022-maps-hero-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/redistricting-2022-maps-hero-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/redistricting-2022-maps-hero-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/redistricting-2022-maps-hero-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That’s a net increase of 11 Democratic-leaning seats from the old maps. Meanwhile, the number of Republican-leaning seats has decreased by six, as has the number of highly competitive seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, that’s just the partisan lean of the districts. To get a sense for how these changes will affect the race for control of the chamber, you need to factor in which party currently controls each seat (not to mention the national political environment, but put that aside for a moment). Still, Democrats are likely to gain seats from redistricting in 2022 even after you consider that they already hold a lot of those newly blue-leaning seats. By my calculations, redistricting alone should net Democrats about two more seats in the House next year,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I arrived at that number: Between seven and nine Republican-held districts have been redrawn to favor Democrats (two in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, three in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and potentially one each in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;), while between six and eight Democratic-held districts have been redrawn to favor Republicans (two in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Georgia,&lt;/a&gt; one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and potentially one each in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a net gain of one seat for Democrats, give or take. But Democrats also gained one seat on net from &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reapportionment&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; each added one new blue seat, while &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; each lost one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a> while Republicans are in position to lose around three or four seats on net from the process.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got this number by taking the roughly one seat Republicans are losing to Democrats on net from redistricting (see previous footnote), and combining it with the two or three net seats Republicans have lost in reapportionment: Population trends added one red seat in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/montana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and potentially one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, but they also subtracted one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>21</sup></a> Of course, the national political environment (which is currently <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning</a>) will have a much bigger impact on the 2022 midterms than redistricting, so this doesn’t mean Democrats are favored to hold onto the House — but it does mean that redistricting made that task slightly more possible.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also have a good sense for what the new maps will look like in the four states that have yet to enact them;<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; will have two seats that are either very or somewhat competitive; &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/missouri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; will either have two safely Democratic seats, five safely Republican seats and one competitive Republican seat, or two safely Democratic seats and six safely Republican seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> is the only state that might deviate significantly from the old map. If we add their projected partisan breakdowns on top of the numbers we already have, I estimate that we’ll end up with 220-223 districts that are to the right of the nation as a whole and 212-215 districts that are to the left of the nation as a whole. Pretty evenly split!</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Accordingly, the tipping-point congressional district — the one that theoretically would be the majority-clinching 218th seat for either party — should be historically close. Since 1996, the tipping-point House seat has always had a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+2.7 or redder. In recent years, it’s been closer to R+5 — meaning, in theory, Democrats have to win the national aggregate House vote by roughly 5 or more percentage points to win a majority in the House. Depending on how things shake out in the remaining four states, the tipping-point seat could be anywhere from R+1.0 to R+1.9 in 2022.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="The House's Republican bias will drop dramatically in 2022" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZMa4D/19/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="670" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Note on the chart how the tipping-point seat’s partisan lean lurched rightward in both 2002 and 2012, reflecting Republicans’ gains in redistricting after the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Not only did Democrats break this mini-streak of good redistricting cycles for Republicans, but they also reversed the effects of two pro-GOP redistricting cycles in one fell swoop.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even in Democrats’ worst-case scenario at this point, the House’s long-standing (we’re talking over 50 years) <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bias toward Republicans</a> would drastically diminish. That would certainly be historic — but it wouldn’t mean everything is finally hunky-dory with our congressional maps. Some of this increase in balance is thanks to courts striking down Republican gerrymanders in states such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>, but Democrats achieved this near-parity mostly through gerrymanders of their own in states such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois</a>. The result is an overall national map that <em>looks</em> fair but individual state maps that are anything but.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We have metrics to show this. <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Efficiency gap</a> is a statistic that attempts to quantify how efficient a map is at converting votes into seats for a given party. For example, a map with an R+10 efficiency gap would be expected to produce 10 percent more Republican-leaning seats than a fair map would. The <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1946&amp;context=public_law_and_legal_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inventors of efficiency gap</a> proposed a test whereby any map that produces two or more extra House seats for a party should be considered an unconstitutional gerrymander. Under the maps in place for the 2022 elections, seven states flunk that test, and several others come close.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A total of 21 states’ maps are worth at least 0.7 extra House seats to the advantaged party, according to efficiency gap. Of course, in real life, parties can’t win fractions of a seat, but in almost all of those 21 states, it’s possible to draw a map that gives another seat to the disadvantaged party. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennessee</a> dismantled the blue district surrounding Nashville and turned it ruby-red. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/utah/orange_3_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utah</a> declined to draw a Salt Lake City-centered district that would have been safely Democratic. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Mexico</a> shifted its only red district 18 points to the left. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey</a> likely cut off Republicans’ chances to unseat three Democratic representatives (Josh Gottheimer, Andy Kim and Mikie Sherrill). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Put bluntly, the national House map still isn't fair; its gerrymanders are just more fairly balanced. And the unfairness of the individual maps has other important consequences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, the new national map is also shaping up to be historically uncompetitive. The number of swing districts has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-swing-districts-dwindle-can-a-divided-house-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the decline for decades</a> thanks to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ending-gerrymandering-wont-fix-what-ails-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factors like ideological self-sorting and increased polarization</a>. But gerrymandering has played a role too: As mentioned above, six highly competitive districts have been drawn out of existence so far this redistricting cycle. And if you take a more generous definition of “competitive,” the decline is even sharper: The number of districts with partisan leans between D+15 and R+15 has dropped by 10 so far.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When the dust settles, the 2022 congressional map could have the fewest swing seats in a generation. Based on our educated guesses of what the eventual maps will look like in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/missouri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missouri</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire</a>, between 36 and 42 congressional districts will have partisan leans between D+5 and R+5. In addition, 121-123 districts will have partisan leans between D+15 and R+15 — the fewest since at least 1996.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="The disappearance of competitive districts will continue in 2022" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GHOmx/13/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="708" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Finally, partisanship isn’t the only way to measure the fairness of congressional maps. As I wrote earlier this month, the new maps <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-this-redistricting-cycle-failed-to-increase-representation-for-people-of-color-and-could-even-set-it-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall short of providing full representation to racial minorities</a>. For example, the population growth that gave Texas two new congressional seats this year was fueled largely by people of color (mostly Latinos), but the two new districts the state drew were both majority-white. And <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several Southern states</a>, such as Alabama, declined to draw additional districts where Black people are the dominant voting bloc, despite it being easily possible to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As mentioned above, lawsuits may remedy some of these problems, but time is rapidly running out for any changes to be made in time for the 2022 election. So while the book isn’t yet closed on the 2021-22 redistricting cycle, the nation’s new congressional map still has serious flaws that are unlikely to be fixed before voters go to the polls. That said, we’ll keep our redistricting coverage going until the last map is absolutely, positively, 100 percent final, just in case we get a surprise in one of the last four states or an unexpected court ruling.

<p data-paragraph="main">Imagine the federal government could lift millions of American children out of poverty with a single program. That program would help parents put nutritious meals on the table, pay for school expenses and even save for kids’ college — all with no negative impact on the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You don’t have to imagine. We had it just last year … and now we don’t.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/61f946b1cb0bb75fd2ca03ad/1643726515657/Child-Tax-Credit-Research-Roundup-CPSP-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">By nearly every empirical measure</a>, the expanded child tax credit (CTC) — the policy passed in 2021 that gave parents a few hundred dollars per month for each child in their family — was a wild success, dramatically reducing child poverty and making it easier for families to buy food and pay for housing and utilities. In combination with other COVID-19 relief measures, particularly the stimulus payments that went out to Americans in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/first-coronavirus-stimulus-checks-deposited.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 2020</a>, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-and-irs-begin-delivering-second-round-of-economic-impact-payments-to-millions-of-americans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/third-economic-impact-payment#:~:text=The%20IRS%20started%20sending%20the,and%20related%20plus-up%20payments." target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2021</a>, the CTC helped buffer families against the economic upheaval of the pandemic.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Child poverty fell when the child tax credit was expanded" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sozeP/15/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s rare that researchers can say with certainty that a program like the CTC actually worked. Politicians usually consider policies in an abstract, hypothetical way, knowing that a piece of legislation might not accomplish their aims. But by the time Congress was thinking about extending the CTC, there was a mountain of cold, hard data showing that this program did a lot to help children and families. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet that wasn’t enough to save it. The expanded tax credit ended in December 2021, and chances are low it will be renewed. That tells you all you need to know about which is more powerful in Washington — politicians’ biases or actual evidence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By the time the pandemic hit, reformers had been pushing for years for the U.S. to establish a universal allowance for families with children. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/23/11440638/child-benefit-child-allowance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many other rich countries</a> give some kind of blanket financial support to parents and, not coincidentally, those countries also have <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/these-rich-countries-have-high-levels-of-child-poverty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower rates of child poverty</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it took the ultimate upheaval — a global pandemic — to nudge American lawmakers into action. In the spring of 2021, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/us/politics/child-tax-credit-payments.html?searchResultPosition=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats in Congress transformed</a> the CTC, an anti-poverty measure that’s been <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/child-tax-credit-overview.aspx#:~:text=It%20was%20established%20as%20a,per%20child%20under%20age%2017." target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the tax code since 1997</a>, into a kind of emergency child allowance. Unlike the original version, which parents received as a single lump sum when they filed their taxes, the expanded CTC was distributed in monthly payments. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/economy/child-tax-credit.html?searchResultPosition=6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From July through December of last year</a>, most parents of children under age 6 received $300 per month per child, and most parents of children between the ages of 6 and 17 received $250 per month per child. The new payment was more generous: Families received up to $3,600 per child per year under the expanded CTC, compared to only $2,000 under the original version. And while the original CTC was mostly available to middle-class families, many more parents were eligible under the expanded program.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original CTC was not fully refundable, which meant that families who had little or no income were not eligible for the whole payment. The expanded CTC was refundable and &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/2021-child-tax-credit-and-advance-child-tax-credit-payments-topic-c-calculation-of-the-2021-child-tax-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;started to phase out&lt;/a&gt; once adjusted gross income reached $75,000 for individual filers, $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married couples who filed jointly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Government programs are often glitchy when they start, but the fact that most families were eligible for the payments meant that they were fairly easy to administer. The IRS already had all the information it needed for anyone who had claimed children on their previous year’s taxes — no additional applications or forms to fill out. The payments <a href="https://www.vox.com/22588701/child-tax-credit-accessibility-irs-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went straight into recipients’ bank accounts</a> or they got a check in the mail, with minimal fuss.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the money helped — a lot. Beginning July 15, the vast majority (88 percent) of families with children <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/child-tax-credit-overview.aspx#:~:text=Beginning%20July%2015%2C%202021%2C%2088,31%2C%202021." target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a payment</a> of either $300 or $250 per child. Researchers at the Columbia University Center on Poverty and Social Policy found that the July payment <a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/monthly-poverty-july-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept around 3 million children out of poverty.</a> At the end of 2021, <a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/montly-poverty-december-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the researchers estimated</a> that the program was keeping 3.7 million children out of poverty. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Families were living in very precarious economic circumstances,” said <a href="https://columbia.academia.edu/MeganCurran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Megan Curran</a>, one of the researchers on the Columbia team. “That $300 or $600 per month — it might not sound like much, but when you’re making very little, it can be enough to give you a financial cushion.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reduction in child poverty was the big, headline-making finding. But the payments helped in other ways, too. <a href="https://rapidsurveyproject.com/our-research/child-tax-credit-is-buffering-families-from-hardship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple</a> <a href="https://socialpolicyinstitute.wustl.edu/how-families-use-ctc-payments-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> found that most parents spent the money on essential things like food, rent and bills.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="How families spent their child allowance payments" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/63l47/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="550" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Low-income parents were especially likely to spend the money on basic needs. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788110#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20the%20first,than%20ultimately%20will%20receive%20it." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/economic-hardship-declined-in-households-with-children-as-child-tax-credit-payments-arrived.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that once the money started arriving, fewer families reported that they didn’t have enough to eat. “The most commonly reported expenditure was food,” Curran said. “After that, it was essential bills — these very basic things that households need.” But the money came in handy for other things, too. When the beginning of the school year rolled around, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/10/nearly-a-third-of-parents-spent-child-tax-credit-on-school-expenses.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%2010%20households,on%20rent%2C%20mortgage%20or%20utilities." target="_blank" rel="noopener">about one-third of parents</a> who received a CTC payment spent at least some of it on school supplies. Another study found that most parents planned to <a href="https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&amp;context=spi_research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save some of the money</a> for a rainy day. Some said they would spend the money on tutors for their children — perhaps helping to offset some of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-has-left-millions-of-students-behind-now-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the learning loss</a> caused by over a year of school disruptions. The payments helped some families <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/child-tax-credit-payment-pay-off-debt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig themselves out of debt</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/14/22826684/build-back-better-child-tax-credit-expires-poverty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escape eviction</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The findings were especially striking because there were no strings attached to the money. Parents could spend the payments however they liked. And despite politicians’ <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2011/03/15/ebt-welfare-restrictions-spendings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longstanding suspicion</a> that if we simply gave people money, they’d <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2012/7/9/20504264/new-state-laws-ban-drinking-smoking-gambling-on-government-s-dime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run out to buy drugs or cigarettes</a>, families were overwhelmingly likely to spend it in ways that directly benefited their children.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it was possible that the expanded payments had drawbacks, too. For years, some economists had been concerned that a child allowance for all families — whether the parents had a job or not — would give some people a reason not to work. <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2021-115/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study published</a> a few months after the CTC expansion estimated that the move would prompt 1.5 million workers to quit their jobs and leave the labor force, canceling out some of the payments’ benefits. In an October opinion column, two co-authors of the study argued that based on their findings, extending the expanded CTC <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/14/press-pause-rush-extend-child-tax-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would do more harm than good</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t seem to be what happened. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When other economists looked</a> at real life data from when the monthly payments were going out, they found that only a small share of parents said they left their jobs. And those people were balanced out by another group of parents who started working after the expanded CTC went into effect — perhaps because they suddenly had enough money to pay for child care. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Researchers sliced and diced the data, looking for any negative effect on the economy. It wasn’t there. “​​Any way that we cut it, we just don’t see an impact on whether parents work,” said <a href="https://economics.barnard.edu/profiles/elizabeth-ananat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Ananat</a>, an economics professor at Barnard College and a co-author of one of the studies. “And that’s in contrast with all the work on poverty and material hardship where we see huge, huge effects.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the evidence didn’t seem compelling to the one person who controlled the expanded CTC’s fate: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. By the fall of 2021, when Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/11/child-tax-credit-climate-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were pondering a renewal of the payments</a> as part of a sprawling social policy bill, it was clear that it wasn’t going to get bipartisan support. That meant if one moderate Democrat defected, the expanded payments would expire at the end of the year. Manchin thought the payments were too broad. He didn’t think parents should be eligible <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/manchin-wont-support-enhanced-child-tax-credit-without-work-requirement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unless they had a job</a>, and he wanted a much lower income cap for parents to qualify. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a certain logic to his reasoning — the payments shouldn’t discourage people from working, and it should only go to the neediest families. But experts told me that these changes wouldn’t actually translate into money better spent. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pam.22324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A complicated formula</a> for determining eligibility can keep the people who most need the money from getting it. And aside from the fact that parents weren’t leaving their jobs because of the payments, work requirements may be counterproductive. “It’s the equivalent of kicking someone when they’re down,” Ananat said. “You might have a sick kid and have to stay home for a day and lose your job. Then you can’t pay for child care to go out and interview for a bunch of new jobs.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Manchin didn’t agree. By the end of 2021, he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-privately-raised-concerns-parents-would-use-child-tax-credit-n1286321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly told other senators</a> that without strict limitations, parents would spend the money on drugs — despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary. The Democrats’ social policy bill <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/19/1065636709/joe-manchin-says-he-cannot-support-bidens-build-back-better-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died in the Senate in December</a>, and the last round of the expanded payments went out to families that same month, with no sign of a renewal in sight.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The impact of losing the money was as dramatic as gaining it. In January and February, families with children <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/02/harder-to-pay-bills-now-that-child-tax-credit-payments-have-ended.html?utm_campaign=20220228msacos1ccstors&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were more likely to say</a> they were struggling to cover household expenses. Child poverty rose. Parents <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/politics/child-tax-credit-child-poverty/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported struggling</a> to pay for diapers and child care. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/09/expanded-child-tax-credit-expiration-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Politico/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted in February found that 75 percent of people who had benefited from the expanded CTC said that losing the money would affect their financial security.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, researchers like Ananat were left standing in frustration on the sidelines, wondering how such a successful program had gone up in smoke. “The thing that’s so heartbreaking to me is that we were able to actually find out what the policy did,” Ananat said. “And now we have an answer. It just helps kids. That’s all it does. And then they just let it go.”</p>]]></description>
