<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank">midterms forecast</a> continues to show Democrats and Republicans in a dead heat Senate race, with Republicans taking a very slight advantage. Recent polls have sent some contradictory messages, but the long and short of it is that seven races are now separated by three points or less polling average. Nate Silver and Galen Druke discuss what to make of it in this installment of “Model Talk” for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>. They also answer listener questions and ponder whether analysts actually believe the polls anymore.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans reached a milestone on Tuesday, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassing a 50 percent chance of a Senate takeover</a> in our Deluxe forecast for the first time since July 25. Still, the race for the Senate is about as close as it gets. So I thought it might be worth engaging in a dialog with my alter egos.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, you’ll meet Nathan Redd. He’ll try to convince me that the Republican outlook is even better than our model shows. Then later this week, we’ll introduce you to Nathaniel Bleu.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, he spells his last name the &lt;a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/bleu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;French way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> While fairly partisan, Redd and Bleu are canny observers of politics who are reasonably numerate. Last night, I met with Redd at a bar near Grand Central Station before his commute back to Connecticut. An abridged transcript follows:</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> You’ve gotta be the luckiest guy I know, Silver.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Wait, what? What are you talking about? How are the kids, by the way? It’s been a while.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> Luckiest guy I know. This is the easiest election call I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Well, we’re not really making “calls” at FiveThirtyEight, exactly. You know how the model works. It’s probabilistic. And the model says the Senate is about as close to 50-50 as it gets.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> You think it’s 50-50? OK, let’s bet then. Steak. Sushi. Rangers tickets. You name it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> You haven’t even told me which side you want to bet on! Though I think I can guess.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> To me there are two scenarios: Republicans win big or Republicans win small.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Shocker.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> I’m telling you, this one is easy. Just look around you. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> It looks like … an Irish bar in Midtown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>It’s half-empty. And yet, the waitress hasn’t been to our table in 15 minutes. Welcome to Joe Biden’s America!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>So, you’re voting Republican because you can’t get your drink refilled?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> I mean, <em>just look</em>. It’s not back to normal. This place used to be packed from 5 p.m. ’til close. Now, they don’t even stay open past 10. Then there’s all the crime, the homelessness. There’s the inflation and the supply chain.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I’ll take you out to Brooklyn next time. It might as well be 2019 there. And when was the last time you closed out a bar? You moved to Connecticut when you were 23 and single.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>You’re getting off-track. The equation is pretty simple. The Democrat Party promised normal. They’re in charge of everything. We haven’t even gotten close to normal. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Are we really saying “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_(epithet)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrat Party”</a> now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> You’re dodging, Silver. I know the numbers. People are <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with how things are going</a>. They’re <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with Biden</a>. Democrats barely even have a majority to begin with and there’s a backlash every midterm election.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republican-polls-affect-model-fivethirtyeight-92562557</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I get that, but it’s not so straightforward. Voters may be unhappy, but they’re <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agnostic about which party they prefer</a>. They remember former President Donald Trump, who <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t leave office as a popular guy</a>. They care about the Supreme Court, which exercises a lot of power even when Republicans are out of office. Have you talked to any of your female friends about abortion?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I don’t trust the polls anyway. C’mon. I read your stuff, believe it or not. I know your <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argument</a> about how it’s hard to predict polling bias. I sort of get it. But let’s do a little thought experiment. Let’s say it’s France, where they ban you from doing polling —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> You can do polls in France! Except for the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20170506-france-media-rules-prohibit-election-coverage-over-weekend-presidential-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekend before the election</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> Silver, this is a thought experiment! Let’s say you’ve got no polls. What does your model say?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Well, it’s not exactly set up to run like that. But if what you’re getting at is Republicans are pretty heavily favored on the basis of the fundamentals, then I agree. At the start of the year, I was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expecting this to be an anticlimax</a> — Republicans would win both chambers of Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>That’s exactly what I’m getting at. I’m not even saying polls will always have a Democratic bias. I’m just saying in <em>this</em> election they will, because if you look at everything <em>apart</em> from the polls, it points toward a big Republican year. And the less you trust the polls, the more you need to look at everything else.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I’m not even sure that’s true. Democrats are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/democratic-fundraising-skyrockets-key-senate-races-rcna51059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising as much or more money than Republicans</a>. They did <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awfully well in those special elections</a> this summer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> Summer? Who cares about summer? The Trump guys I know, they don’t vote in the summer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> So now you’re back to making assertions based on imaginary friends of yours?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> And by the way, I do talk to my female friends about abortion. Abortion is a problem for Republicans. That’s why I’m not sure if we’re going to win small or win big. But pretty much everything else lines up on our side.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I don’t see how you can be so confident about all of this.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I’m not confident! I just told you, I don’t know if we’re going to win small or big. But lately I’ve been thinking big. You want to know why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I’m sure you’re going to tell me.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>You know my favorite saying? Follow the outfielders, not the ball. When Aaron Judge hits a fly ball, look at what the left fielder is doing. Don’t listen to the crowd, they’re a bunch of idiots. Look at the professionals. The professionals are backing way up, like it’s going to be a big year for Republicans. Look where the campaigns are spending. For Democrats, it’s in blue districts. They have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/31/democrats-rush-aid-to-deep-blue-seat-in-upstate-new-york-00064258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems in New York</a>. I’m going to ask you about my boy and future New York governor Lee Zeldin in a minute, by the way. They have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/more-house-races-shift-in-gop-favor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trouble in California</a>. They’re even <a href="https://www.local10.com/vote-2022/2022/11/01/biden-headed-to-south-florida-to-campaign-1-week-before-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sending Biden to Miami-Dade County</a>!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>For a guy who’s as cynical about the media as you are, you’re awfully willing to buy into cherry-picked narratives. I don’t see how there’s any information given away by Biden visiting South Florida, for instance — it’s a swingy part of the country! And midterm elections can be regional. For every Lee Zeldin, you’ve got an Oklahoma, where the race is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/oklahoma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprisingly tight in the other direction</a>. And by the way, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-had-a-superior-electoral-college-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professionals aren’t always so smart</a>. They’re just as much in the fog of war as anyone else.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I’m just saying, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Occam’s razor</a>, Republicans win this thing. Keep it simple.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Occam’s razor? Where <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=occams+razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have I heard that before</a>? But here’s the thing: I’m not actually sure that keeping it simple is better. There’s a reason we go through the trouble of building a model and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the extra work that entails</a>. I’m not sure that people’s intuitions are very good when it comes to election forecasting. In 2012, the media <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-campaign-idUKBRE8A30HP20121104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insisted that the race was a toss-up</a> because they were looking at national polls, not realizing that former President Barack Obama had a pretty big edge in the Electoral College. In 2016, they didn’t realize how fragile Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s lead was because of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correlated errors between the states</a>. They kept it simple and they were wrong! Sometimes the devil is in the details!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I’ll tell you a detail. Your <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> still has Democratic John Fetterman up in Pennsylvania’s Senate race. He’s not going to win after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/us/politics/fetterman-debate-pennsylvania-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that debate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Ahead? I mean, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just barely</a>. And it’s still not <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-voters-are-reacting-to-fettermans-debate-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entirely clear how much the debate changed things</a>. But I agree with you in principle: if there’s news that hasn’t yet been fully reflected in the polls, that’s going to make our model a lagging indicator.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>And I tell you who <em>else </em>is going to win: my boy Lee Zeldin. People are sick of Kathy Hochul. Maybe you need to step out of your media bubble.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Your boy? Do you actually know him? You live in Greenwich, Connecticut, not New York. Who’s living in the bubble? And he’s probably not going to win. Hochul’s still <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ahead in the polls</a>. And by the way, this cuts against everything you were saying earlier about the fundamentals. Even if Republicans are having a pretty good night, we’re living in very partisan times — it’s hard to win as a Republican in New York these days.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>So, we got a bet?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>You on Zeldin, me on Hochul? Sure. Winner picks the restaurant and the wine, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>No, on the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I’m going to pass. Our model has it at 50-50, it’s been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-is-a-toss-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trending Republican</a>, and you make a couple of semi-persuasive points, like about Pennsylvania. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>Semi-persuasive! That’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me, Silver! And good luck on Tuesday, but you won’t need it. It’s going to be an early night.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Two years after helping <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deliver President Biden the presidency</a>, and four years after decisively handing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control of the House of Representatives</a> to the Democratic Party, Americans living in the suburbs are poised to once again play a major role in an election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after Democrats got the upper hand in suburban areas in 2018 and 2020, the pendulum looks set to swing back in the GOP’s direction in 2022 — at least to some extent. Most of the House races that will decide the election will take place in suburban and exurban districts: About 7 in 10 House races viewed as at least somewhat competitive — those not rated as solidly Democratic or Republican — are in predominantly suburban districts, according to in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the Deluxe forecast, as of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern. Forecast ratings are based on win probabilities: Solid Democratic/Republican means a party’s chance of winning is 95 percent or better; likely Democratic/Republican means a party’s chances are between 75 and 95 percent; lean Democratic/Republican means a party’s chances are between 60 and 75 percent; and toss-up means each party has less than a 60 percent chance of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> And Republicans, with better than a 4-in-5 shot of winning control of the House, according to the forecast, appear well-positioned to win a sufficient number of those seats to capture a majority.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">About half the districts in the House are categorized as Dense Suburban or Suburban-Exurban, which we would expect given that more of the nation’s population <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-14/u-s-is-majority-suburban-but-doesn-t-define-suburb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lives in suburban areas</a> compared with urban or rural ones. And in line with the higher level of electoral competitiveness in suburban and exurban areas, the average seat in these categories is notably less blue or red than its more urban or rural counterparts.</p>

Dense Urban seats have an urbanization index of 13 or higher; Urban-Suburban from 12.5 to 13; Dense Suburban from 11.5 to 12.5; Suburban-Exurban from 10.5 to 11.5; Rural-Exurban from 9.5 to 10.5; and Mostly Rural below 9.5. Population data is taken from the 2020 census.</p>
 <p>The average-per-category columns reflect the average share of each district’s population that lives in census tracts defined as rural, exurban or small town, suburban or small city, or urban core or large city, which are categorized as follows: Rural has fewer than 25,000 people living within a five-mile radius of a census tract; exurban or small town as having between 25,000 and 99,999; suburban or small city as having between 100,000 and 249,999 people; and urban core or large city as having 250,000 or more.</p>
 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight’s forecast rates 75 districts as at least marginally competitive; of those, 53 are either Dense Suburban or Suburban-Exurban. (All data in this article is as of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.) As things stand, the suburban seats that are rated as lean or likely GOP would get Republicans to 211 seats when combining that with races that are rated Solid Republican, and winning most of the toss-up districts in those groupings would then put them over the top. Tellingly, of the 15 seats that have at least a 2 percent chance in our forecast of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-tipping-point-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being the “tipping-point” district</a> — that is, the decisive 218th seat for a party’s House majority — 12 are either Dense Suburban or Suburban-Exurban districts. Republicans are favored to some extent in nine of them, although not a lock to win any.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But that seat-by-seat count likely underestimates the GOP’s potential to capture suburban seats because the results in each district on Nov. 8 will not be <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/probability-independent-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent of each other</a>. That is, the swing to the right (or, less likely, the left) in a few districts <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will probably signal</a> at least some shift in the same direction elsewhere. In our forecast’s simulations, the average outcome is 230 Republican seats, seven more seats than we get when we simply assign each seat to the party with the highest win probability. That’s because if Republicans win some of the swingiest seats where Democrats currently hold a slim edge, other highly competitive seats may also swing to the right. This is a reasonably likely outcome, too, considering the GOP now has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slight lead in the generic ballot</a> that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could grow by Election Day</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s take a brief look at some of the key districts in each category. </p>



<h2><strong>Suburban-Exurban districts</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thirty-three of the 53 competitive suburban races are in districts classified as Suburban-Exurban. Overall, 11 of these seats are either toss-ups or favor the GOP to some extent. At the forefront of that group is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/iowa/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa’s 3rd District</a>, a slightly right-leaning seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/iowa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that includes Des Moines</a>, which is the most likely tipping-point district in our forecast. Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne is defending this seat, but she appears to be a slight underdog. On the East Coast, three other light-red seats held by Democrats are also under threat. Reps. Elaine Luria and Susan Wild each have about a 50-50 chance of retaining <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/virginia/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia’s 2nd District</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 7th District</a>, respectively, while Rep. Tom Malinowski is trailing in his reelection race in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-jersey/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey’s 7th District</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This group also includes a couple of toss-up races along the U.S.-Mexico border in South Texas, where Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-republican-gains-in-south-texas-win-them-more-house-seats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hope to build</a> on the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gains they made in the region</a> in 2020. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/texas/34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas’s 34th District</a>, the incumbent-versus-incumbent contest between Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez and Republican Rep. Mayra Flores appears up in the air despite the district’s fairly strong (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on paper</a> at least) Democratic lean. There’s also a toss-up contest next door in the purple <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/texas/15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15th District</a>, although the Republican trend there might make this seat <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/08/24/tx15-vallejo-de-la-cruz-2022-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the GOP’s better pickup opportunities</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats do hold at least a small edge in 22 of these Suburban-Exurban seats, yet while almost all of these are being defended by Democratic incumbents, there are some juicy targets for Republicans. This group includes some light-blue seats in the northeast, like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York’s 17th District</a>, where Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/27/maloney-dems-new-york-midterms-00063645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is at risk</a> of being the first chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to lose reelection <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1584524155809996800?s=20&amp;t=79UbkR1fKrxQJVbJF2kxGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1980</a>. But it also includes a couple red-leaning Rust Belt seats, such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 8th District</a>, where Rep. Matt Cartwright is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to defy gravity</a> as northeast Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/us/politics/blue-collar-voters-pennsylvania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shifted more Republican</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Dense Suburban</strong> districts</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also 20 competitive races happening in the Dense Suburban category, including three toss-ups. Among that trio, Republicans are looking to flip two notable open seats: the bluest seat on their radar, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/rhode-island/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhode Island’s 2nd District</a>, and swingy suburban Pittsburgh turf in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 17th District</a>. But in the other toss-up race, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan’s 3rd District</a>, Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-spent-loads-boosting-republicans-they-thought-were-less-electable-will-it-pay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have made it harder</a> on themselves <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by ousting</a> GOP Rep. Peter Meijer in the primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ten of those competitive seats currently advantage the GOP, including California’s blue-leaning but Republican-held <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27th District</a>, which major outside Democratic groups <a href="https://twitter.com/allymutnick/status/1583489245708423168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently decided to abandon by cutting their ad spending</a>. And as the GOP’s chances have improved in the House, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two purple seats</a> in Ohio where Republicans are favored are now the second- and seventh-most likely tipping-point seats in our forecast: In the Cincinnati-based <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/ohio/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1st District</a>, Republican Rep. Steve Chabot is likely to win, while Republicans look to have a similar edge in the open, Akron-based <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/ohio/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13th District</a> south of Cleveland.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, Democrats are favored in seven competitive seats in the Dense Suburban category, although some could still get picked off if the GOP has a good night. The open seat in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York’s 3rd District</a> may be most in danger, as the Long Island-based seat is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a light-blue seat</a>. But Democrats also need to defend <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/kansas/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas’s 3rd District</a>, a red-tinged seat in Kansas City’s suburbs, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/27/upshot/times-siena-toplines-house-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite some recent strong polling</a> for Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, neither party views the race as a done deal based on <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article267423067.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside spending</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The suburbs make up a big chunk of the districts in the House of Representatives — and the lion’s share of the districts that will be most contested on Election Day. Republicans are favored to win the House, and should they capture a majority, there’s a high likelihood that their gains in seats in the Dense Suburban and Suburban-Exurban groupings will have played a starring role in that outcome.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Sergio Piedra, 51, remembers when “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105323610/flight-tickets-inflation-pandemic-revenge-travel-vacation-europe-recession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revenge travel</a>” — or traveling to make up for lost time during the COVID-19 pandemic — was at an all-time high. But after an initial influx of out-of-towners to his home state of Florida, Piedra, who works for a local tourism marketing organization, began to notice a slight dip in visitors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This is how I make a living,” he told me. “So it’s important to me that people are willing to travel.” And right now, ahead of the winter holiday season, he’s especially on edge. “It’s important to me that people are willing to travel, spend money and have a good time.” As concerns about the economy mount, however, it’s unclear whether that’ll be the case. While bookings and vacations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/travel/trends-spring-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared to increase</a> throughout the United States this past spring, <a href="https://business.fau.edu/newsroom/press-releases/2022/florida-travel-slowdown.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ve since declined</a>. It <em>does </em>look like people will be traveling for the holidays — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-save-on-holiday-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but it won’t be cheap</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra, who identifies as a Democrat, understands that other Americans may be worse off — both he and his wife are still employed — but the U.S. economy is still a top concern for him. And he’s far from being alone: The latest wave of our <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos</a> poll using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a> found that “inflation or increasing costs” was top of mind for most Americans. (According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ipsos-preelection-survey-likely-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our latest survey data</a>, 65 percent of Americans said that issue was among the most important facing the country.) </p>

In some cases, like Piedra’s, those fears haven’t stopped them from supporting Democrats. But other voters of color I spoke with said that, despite their political affiliation, they currently trust the GOP more on issues related to the economy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was the case with James Harris, 23, who lives in California and identifies as an independent voter. In fact, Harris told me that he hopes the next Congress is gridlocked so that there’s more compromise in D.C. — something he’s optimistic will lead to more bipartisan solutions when it comes to addressing the country’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/10/06/7-top-economic-minds-think-global-recession-coming-some-say-its-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current economic problems</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you have Republicans in the House, Democrats in the Senate and then [President] Biden in White House, there’s going to <em>have </em>to be compromise,” he said. “While Democrats might want to pass more ambitious bills that carry a steep price tag, Republicans aren’t going to want to increase spending. And, in the end, I think that might be a healthy balance.” (The Deluxe version of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a> currently favors Republicans to win the House, while the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate is a dead heat</a>.) </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As Harris and Piedra’s differing stances show, voters of color have competing views when it comes to what they’re most worried about regarding the economy <em>and </em>what they want the federal government to do about it. Despite my interviewees’ fears about the economy, though, not everyone viewed increased federal spending — such as Biden’s <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/debt-relief-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">student loan forgiveness initiative</a> or the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/biden-1point9-trillion-covid-relief-package-thursday-afternoon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 stimulus checks</a> — as a bad<em> </em>thing. “I’m for them,” said 45-year-old Beth Napper, “not because I necessarily think they help the economy as a whole, but because I think they help <em>individuals</em> who are impacted by the economy that we’re in.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><hr><span></span></div>
 



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: How much is the economy factoring into your voting decision in this election cycle? Is it more of a factor than it usually is or about the same? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beth Napper (45, Virginia, Black, Democrat): Economic concerns comprise at least 60 percent of my decision for voting in this year’s midterm election, which is more than usual. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sergio Piedra (51, Florida, Hispanic, Democrat): I work in the tourism industry, so I can always feel the ebb and flow of the economy. I’ve been lucky enough to maintain a job [throughout the pandemic], but I understand that many others are struggling and I sympathize with that. When I go to the voting booth, concerns about the economy will be top of mind — but they always are for me. It won’t be any greater or less this year. Statistically, how the economy is doing comprises about 50 percent in how I decide who I vote for; the other 50 percent is a bunch of other things. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">James Harris (23, California, Hispanic and white, independent): I’ve never voted before, but the economy, in my opinion, is the most important issue for my family and me this year. I know that the unemployment rate is low right now, but, because of inflation, I think that confidence in the economy is very low, too. Right now, I’m worried about gas prices and the uncertainty of how things will go. I currently work two jobs — a night job and a day job — not because I’m living paycheck to paycheck, but because expenses are going up and I want to prepare for a possible recession next year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Zachary Bimslager (43, Texas, Black and white, Libertarian): It’s hard to quantify exactly how much the economy factors into my vote this year. It’s definitely the most important factor, but I wouldn’t say that it’s more or less important than it has been in any other election. The economy is always my No. 1 issue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maya Kannan (19, Texas, Asian, Republican): This is the first election that I’ll be voting in, actually, but if I were to give a percentage, I’d say that the economy comprises about 40 percent of my voting decisions this year. It’s definitely my top issue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What are you most worried about regarding the economy? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I’m worried about people worrying about the economy. It almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, you know: Things are bad, but it gets made worse if everyone is thinking about the worst possible outcome. I don’t mean to say that everyone needs to be as optimistic as I am, but we’ve been through so much as a country in the last few years and we’re still standing. We just need to keep moving forward. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: The impact of inflation and how long it will continue to ramp up. And while this doesn’t impact me directly, the trend toward a gig economy is something I’ve seen and heard more about from my friends, and I don’t think that’s sustainable for the average person to take them through their working life and into retirement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: A lot of news outlets are predicting that we’re going to be in a recession next year, and I’m really nervous to see how things will turn out. My fear is that the people who will be most affected by a potential recession are retail workers or people who are just entering the workforce. I’m also worried about how high the unemployment rate will rise <em>if </em>we go into a recession.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: Obviously, the elephant in the room is inflation. While I’m also concerned about things like employment numbers, too, inflation is the top economic issue that I’m concerned about.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Have you swung back and forth in terms of the economic issues you’ve cared about most in 2022?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: The whole gas price shock threw me for a loop. At one point I was thinking, ‘Man, how high can these prices go?’ But I think I’ve reeled back from that as things have stabilized — relatively speaking — into the summer and fall. I don’t want to sound self-serving, but as we enter the holiday season, I’ve been thinking more about the impact the economy has on the tourism industry and whether people are going to get back to leisure traveling. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: No, I don’t think so. I feel like the same issues have been prevalent throughout all of 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: Yes, certainly. At the beginning of the year, unemployment was my top concern. I saw a number of people lose jobs and that started to scare me. Later on, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rising gas prices became my biggest worry. Then, once inflation got out of hand, that became a bigger deal to me over energy prices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Have your own personal finances — or your general financial situation — changed in the last few years?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: Not really, no. It has been steady. I’ve been through worse situations. For example, during the Great Recession, I didn’t get a pay raise for five years. But my wife and I have continued to work, receive pay increases and pay our bills — so that has been good.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: Before I moved to San Francisco, I was living in Indianapolis, where I went to school and graduated May 2022. While I was there, though, I didn’t own a car and would borrow my friend’s. Whenever I had to fill up the gas tank, it would be about $30, but, month by month, that increased and eventually it got closer to $50. I started noticing how much more I was paying in gas starting in summer 2021 compared to years prior. And throughout the year until now, it has gotten worse. Those small expenses that you have to do on a daily or weekly basis — like buying groceries or getting gas — add up, and it puts me in a hard position because I’ve had to sacrifice some of my wants to pay for these things.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: No. I’ve been employed by the same company for a very long time, so our salaries haven’t really been affected by issues with the economy. As a consumer, my buying power is down with the current inflation rates, but it hasn’t been <em>too</em> drastic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Who do you think is responsible for your current financial situation?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: Myself. There’s a lot of factors that I can’t control — whether it’s the government or how many people are traveling at any given time — but, at the end of the day, you still have to work and make the right decisions economically. So, in a sense, I feel like I’m the one most responsible for what happens to me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: In all honesty, part of it is on me. I know that I need to budget better and probably not do things like buy coffee in the morning or order Ubers. But I think the primary reason why the economy is in the position that it’s in is due to supply shortages all around the world. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: Ultimately, I am, but in a political context, I’d say that both parties are responsible. At any given point in time, I’d blame the political party in power, but I do think that both Democrats and Republicans make the same mistakes regarding the economy — particularly when it comes to federal spending. This is a systemic issue, though, so I wouldn’t necessarily blame neither Biden nor [former President Donald] Trump for where we are today. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: I think that a lot rests on the previous president. While there was a lot of economic growth under the Trump administration, the beginning of certain spending expenditures that ultimately led to the economic issues we have now started with him. I also think you could argue that Trump wasn’t tough enough on Russia, and, if he were, that may have prevented some of the issues we’re facing now. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are you more concerned about your own financial situation or the country’s?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: The country’s. But what I’m really worried about is the middle class. What I’ve observed and heard in conversations with friends, families and the various communities I’m a part of is a concern for whether our country’s current economic situation is sustainable; and if it’s not, I’m worried about what the ripple effects of that will be. Will that mean higher taxes? More inflation? Those are all major concerns of mine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: The country’s. I have a budget and try to follow it as closely as I can, but I am really worried about the country’s economy because if it isn’t in good shape, then unemployment will eventually go up. I’m also worried about job security — not just for my own sake, but for other Americans and my family members, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: Definitely the country’s. Thankfully, my father is very established in his career and I’m pursuing a degree that has promising job prospects, so I’m not overly concerned about my own finances. That said, there’s definitely reason to suspect that many people in the U.S. are going to suffer from this period we’re in now. Inflation affects things like tuition, but a lot of jobs still require a college degree. And if more people forego a college education as a result, that could impact their future income. Certainly, the situation we’re in now is going to have long-term, negative effects for a very large swath of people in the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Do you think recent federal spending initiatives have contributed to rising inflation? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I think so, but I also believe these things needed to be done for the good of the country. For every action, there’s going to be a reaction. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: Yes, but I support most of those initiatives. And while they’ve contributed to inflation, they’re by no means, at least in my mind, the root cause of what we’re seeing today. I think that the economic situation we’re in now has been in the works for some time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: Absolutely. While I supported initiatives like the American Rescue Plan, I think the federal government also overspent during that time. And I’ve seen a lot of articles about PPP money getting stolen, so I wish that we would’ve spent less during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: To a certain degree, but I wouldn’t blame them for everything we’re seeing now. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the country’s economic downturn, too. Of course, a certain amount of inflation is inevitable, and I think some federal spending initiatives — from both the Biden and Trump administrations — were wasteful, but I wouldn’t necessarily blame only the most <em>recent</em> ones for everything we’re seeing now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are you for or against recent Biden administration proposals and policies that have or will affect the economy — such as the COVID-19 stimulus checks or forgiving some student loan debt?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I’m mostly for the things that [Biden] is doing. I may not agree with everything, but you have to give the man a shot at trying. The idea is to come up with something different from the previous administrations, and I want to see how that plays out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: I didn’t receive any stimulus money because, at the time, I was still dependent on my parents. While I think a lot of people needed the money, and I supported giving COVID-19 stimulus checks to individuals, I believe that the way it was rolled out was ineffective because there was a lot of fraud. And, to be honest, I don’t support Biden’s student loan debt initiative because the cost of universities is still going to go up, and, 10 years from now, we’re still going to have people in debt. Even though a lot of people will be helped by loan forgiveness, [the initiative] still doesn’t address the underlying issue of why college tuition is increasing and how we can bring a stop to that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: I’m not necessarily in favor of them primarily because I don’t think that a lot of these spending initiatives will lead to [Biden’s] desired outcome. For example, I don’t think that the Inflation Reduction Act will do much to curb inflation. That said, I’m not up in arms about these policies, either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: Conceptually, I agreed with the stimulus checks. My family received them, but I don’t think we necessarily needed them — so some of the spending there might have been excessive. I also question whether the stimulus checks discouraged people from seeking employment during the labor shortage. And while I understand the sentiment behind the student loan initiative, I wonder if now was the best time to deploy that. It also doesn’t really solve the problem of unaffordable higher education. It’s a policy to win votes, but it doesn’t solve the underlying issues at hand. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What, if anything, do you hope the federal government will do to alleviate your concerns regarding the economy?  </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: I would like to see more bipartisan support for measures that really deal with what I think are the root causes of our current economic situation. In an ideal world, I would like to see our representatives fight for what’s right for individuals versus corporations. I think that a lot of people equate the strength of our economy to the strength of corporations and, as far as I can tell, our corporations are as strong — or stronger — than they’ve ever been. That’s happening, though, at the detriment of the individual. So I want more policies that focus on helping people. I can’t name anything specific that I’d like to see, but I want more of a shift in the mindset of our politicians. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: They just need to stop spending so much money in general. But I’d have that critique of any administration, regardless of party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: There needs to be more accountability and transparency about how federal money is being spent. It is important to get an explanation of how specific spending initiatives in the budget accomplish the government’s goals — say, improved welfare, greater security, economic growth, et cetera. I’m not saying that we need to spend less necessarily, but we need to know what’s supposed to happen with that money. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Which party do you trust more on economic issues? Why? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I’ll be loyal and say that I trust my party, the Democrats. I think with Democrats, there’s a degree of realism, but with Republicans, they just want to repeat the same tactic over and over again: Cut taxes here and allegedly cut spending there — and they never really do either well. Their economic messaging has become really tiresome to me.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: At the moment, I don’t trust either party because I feel that everyone is more concerned with being reelected than the work that we elect them to do while they’re there. I hope that there are individuals who are not that way, but, on the whole, that’s how I view both parties.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: Honestly, neither of them. But if I had to choose right now, I’d say that I trust the Republicans more. Republicans want to bring taxes down, which I support. We also need to focus on bringing federal spending down, and I think that the Republicans are more cognizant about that. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: If you asked me this a few years ago, I would have said the Republican Party easily. But at the moment, the Democrats have a slight edge. That’s not to say that I fully trust them, but I think Republicans, unfortunately, given the current leadership, are not very good at determining which battles are worth fighting. When I was younger and first started identifying as Republican, politicians like Mitt Romney were quite content with globalization as a way of improving the standard of living. Trump, meanwhile, was ready to sacrifice standard of living just to counter globalization, which, to me, is not sound economic policy. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Sunday, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/overturning-roe-has-meant-at-least-10000-fewer-legal-abortions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight published data</a> showing that there were at least 10,000 fewer legal abortions in July and August than before the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Those numbers — from #WeCount, a research project funded by the nonprofit Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights — provided a detailed, if incomplete, picture of how abortion has changed in the United States since the Dobbs decision in June. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One key question was left unanswered, though: How many of the people unable to get a legal abortion got one another way? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2797883" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new research paper released today</a> begins to answer that question. It shows that Aid Access, <a href="https://www.vox.com/23056530/aid-access-abortion-roe-wade-pills-mifepristone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an international abortion pill service</a> that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/health/fda-aid-access-abortion-pill-warning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distributes medication abortion</a> in places where it’s illegal, received a combined total of 6,533 more requests for pills from the United States in July and August 2022, with each month compared to an April 2022 baseline.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data compiled in the paper is limited to the 30 states in which Aid Access does not currently provide telemedecine abortion within a formal health care setting. It also excludes requests made to Aid Access for abortion pills that patients who said they were not yet pregnant requested in order to keep pills on hand, just in case. We calculated the difference between the number of requests made in July vs. April and in August vs. April to match the calculations we had made in our previous reporting on the #WeCount data. We did not use data from May or June, as the Supreme Court’s leaked opinion in May and final opinion in June could have caused noise we could not control for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667321522000373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous analysis of Aid Access data suggests</a> that about 50 to 60 percent of requests result in completed abortions, which would mean at least an additional 3,267 abortions in July and August combined, compared to that April baseline. While this estimate is inexact, the increase demonstrates the role that self-managed abortion now plays in shaping abortion access in America.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every time we’ve seen policy restricting abortion, we’ve seen increases in demand to Aid Access,” said Dr. Abigail Aiken, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the co-authors on the study. “The evidence that we’ve seen shows us that when you ban or severely restrict abortion, you don’t do anything to change the need for abortion. But what you seem to do is change how and where people access care.” </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voters-decide-future-abortion-rights-michigan-fivethirtyeight-92494272</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Aid Access, the abortion provider at the heart of the study, was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctor-rebecca-gomperts-helps-americans-abortions-reports-4000-inquiries-since-roe-overturned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded in 2018 by Dutch activist Dr. Rebecca Gomperts</a>, who is also a co-author on the paper. Aid Access occupies a kind of legal gray area — in 2019, the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/aidaccessorg-575658-03082019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to stop the organization</a> from shipping pills into the U.S., saying that Aid Access was violating federal law by distributing misbranded and unapproved drugs, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/758871490/european-doctor-who-prescribes-abortion-pills-to-u-s-women-online-sues-fda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but it was unsuccessful</a>, and Gomperts has repeatedly said her organization follows the law. It’s a crime to self-manage an abortion in <a href="https://www.ifwhenhow.org/abortion-criminalization-new-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three states</a> — Oklahoma, South Carolina and Nevada — and it’s against the law to prescribe abortion pills remotely <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 19 states</a>. It’s also <a href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/import-basics/personal-importation#refusals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal in many cases</a> for Americans to import drugs from overseas for personal use. But these laws are difficult to enforce and individuals are <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/pharma-and-life-sciences/as-abortion-access-shrinks-people-turn-to-imported-pills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rarely prosecuted</a>, essentially creating a legal loophole for groups like Aid Access and the people who use their services. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because it has been offering its services to clients in the United States for several years, Aid Access has data that covers multiple phases in American abortion policy. The organization requires clients to fill out a form detailing their medical history and reason for requesting abortion pills, which is reviewed by a medical provider. If there are no medical red flags in that self-reported data, the organization sends the requester pills. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the constitutional right to abortion was overturned in June, Aid Access’s online request form blew up. According to the new paper, the number of weekly requests for abortion pills from Aid Access rose in a number of states, with the highest increases coming from people in states with full bans on abortion. For example, requests rose the most in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Oklahoma — all of which had implemented near-total bans on abortion by early July.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/article_f0398ef4-045f-11ed-896d-db553e7f3549.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Louisiana banned abortion&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the Dobbs ruling, but a series of court rulings meant that abortion was intermittently available through the month of July. Abortion has been fully and consistently illegal in Louisiana &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/10/1116802767/louisianas-abortion-ban-has-doctors-worried-about-patients-and-their-own-careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;since early August&lt;/a&gt;. Requests were measured per 100,000 female residents of reproductive age (15 to 44).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In these states, some people may see an organization like Aid Access as their only option. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2798215?guestAccessKey=70c1bc40-5cc0-4bcf-a73d-a5b9b26ccf01&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=110122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another paper published today</a> by Ushma Upadhyay, a professor and public health social scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, found that in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling, an estimated one-third of reproductive-age women in the U.S. live in a census tract more than an hour from an abortion facility.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding Hawaii and Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> For people living in Texas, estimated travel time to an abortion clinic rose by almost eight hours.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The availability of abortion pills — which, if taken during early pregnancy, result in <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-availability-and-use-of-medication-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a process very similar to an early miscarriage</a> — has transformed the way abortion happens in the U.S.. Medication abortion was already growing in popularity, even before abortion rights appeared to be seriously threatened. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study</a> published by the Guttmacher Institute earlier this year estimated that medication abortion accounted for more than half (54 percent) of abortions in 2020, up from 39 percent in 2017. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The vast majority</a> of U.S. abortions happen in the first trimester, which means abortion pills — which the FDA has approved for use <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the 10th week</a> of pregnancy — are an option for many patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a change in the way abortion pills are regulated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/health/abortion-pills-fda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed them to be prescribed legally</a> through telehealth in some states. Since then, several online-only abortion services have popped up. These companies operate legally in the U.S. and can only mail pills to states where abortion is legal. They also offer virtual medical supervision in case of complications.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Medication abortion isn’t just used for legal abortions, though — it’s also a safe, hard-to-detect way to terminate a pregnancy outside the medical and legal system. In the era before Roe v. Wade, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-history-of-back-alley-abortions-can-teach-us-about-a-future-without-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various methods of self-induced abortion</a> often resulted in infection or other serious health problems. Now, though, it’s relatively easy for people to order abortion pills over the internet from services like Aid Access. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Medication abortion is effective and low-risk — even when it’s used outside the clinical setting. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2790319#:~:text=Conclusions%20and%20Relevance%20In%20this,involving%20ultrasonography%20or%20pelvic%20examination." target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study published earlier this year</a> of nearly 4,000 women who received abortion pills without an in-person visit found that 95 percent of the abortions were completed without the need for further medical intervention, and less than 1 percent resulted in serious complications. But <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-can-expect-if-abortion-pills-become-their-only-safe-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it can also be intensely painful for some</a>, and there’s no real way to know in advance what kind of experience any one person will have. Aiken said that <a href="https://www.mahotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotline services</a> for self-managed miscarriage and abortion can help people deal with that variability at home, but also said it was significant that the use of medication abortion and extralegal providers like Aid Access is increasing even in states where abortion remains legal. “There were a substantial portion of folks saying, ‘I’m making this request because I prefer the comfort and privacy of my own home,’” she said. “They have a choice, they could go to a clinic, they could do something else, but they’re actually choosing to self manage.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, pill providers like Aid Access represent a safe way of self-managing abortion — something that did not exist in the pre-Roe era. “So as long as the bans remain in place, I think we’re going to see those numbers remain stable, if not increase,” Aiken said.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">After then-President Donald Trump’s speech on Jan. 6, 2021, some of his supporters left his rally and smashed their way into the U.S. Capitol building, and now <a href="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly a thousand of them are facing charges</a>. But some in the crowd that day have gone on to try to enter the Capitol the old-fashioned way: by running for Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are at least nine GOP candidates running for Senate, House and governor seats this fall who were in attendance at the Jan. 6 rally, according to FiveThirtyEight’s database. Their attendance indicates an extreme acceptance of Trump’s inaccurate claims of a stolen election. Of those nine, just one is running in a race that is either likely or solidly Republican, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Deluxe forecast</a>. Here’s a closer look at each of those nine candidates, including what we know about their activities that day and how likely they are to win their election, as of Monday at 12 p.m. Eastern. (All data in this article is as of this date and time.)</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<h2><strong>Tina Forte: New York’s 14th District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this district that covers much of the Bronx and Queens in New York City, Forte is challenging Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You probably don’t need to check the forecast to figure out what kind of odds Forte has. She is a right-wing influencer and Newsmax contributor who gained a following from selling Trump merchandise and spreading QAnon conspiracy theories. She has repeated Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and livestreamed her participation in the Jan. 6 rally, telling followers to get their “<a href="https://twitter.com/snopes/status/1430954398998351875" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asses to the Capitol</a>.” Forte later said she didn’t regret attending Jan. 6 even after the violence that broke out, <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/2022-elections/2022/09/29/tina-forte--aoc-s-opponent--is-a-jan--6-attendee-with-ties-to-extremists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telling NY1</a>, “I went there to shine light on the election. I did nothing. I didn’t participate in anything that went on that day, from what I see on videos or anything that they want to call it.” Forte has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a less than 1-in-100</a> chance of winning, according to our forecast.</p>

<h2><strong>Elizabeth Joy: New York’s 20th District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Joy attended the Jan. 6 rally outside of the Capitol and posted photos on social media on the day, but she said she was “football fields” away from the violent attack. <a href="https://dailygazette.com/2021/01/08/joy-extremists-detracted-from-concerns-about-election-integrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She condemned the violence</a> and said those who broke into the Capitol were “extremists.” The race for this district based around Albany is a rerun: Joy challenged incumbent Democratic Rep. Paul Tonko in 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-new-york-house-district-20.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and lost by 22 points</a>, a result she may face yet again: Our forecast gives her <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2-in-100 chance</a> of winning.</p>



<h2><strong>J.R. Majewski: Ohio’s 9th District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Majewski is an Air Force veteran <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/10/ohio-man-paints-entire-yard-as-trump-banner/42085319/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who once made headlines</a> for painting almost his entire front lawn into a Trump sign. Majewski attended the Jan. 6 march in D.C. and <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/media/3936186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed to have funded</a> travel for other attendees, though he says he “<a href="https://twitter.com/JRMajewski/status/1535129741241597952?s=20&amp;t=4gBxHKdjTZ7fFdTzp1Fe0w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed no crimes</a>” and “broke no police barriers.” He’s hoping to unseat Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/WIC/Historical-Data/Women-Who-Have-Served-More-Than-25-Years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House’s longest-serving woman</a>. And there’s a chance he might. During redistricting, the Republican-controlled Ohio Redistricting Commission <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redrew Kaptur’s district</a>, transforming it from a Democratic stronghold into a slightly Republican-leaning district. That said, Majewski has lost some momentum after the Associated Press reported <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-afghanistan-ohio-campaigns-e75d2566635f11f49332bd1c46711999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he had misrepresented</a> parts of his military service record, prompting the National Republican Congressional Committee <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/22/house-gop-cuts-loose-candidate-who-misled-about-military-service-00058406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to kill a nearly $1 million ad buy</a> it had planned for the race. FiveThirtyEight’s forecast gives Majewski <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/ohio/9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 23-in-100 chance</a> of winning the race.</p>



<h2><strong>Doug Mastriano: Pennsylvania governor</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mastriano, the Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania, <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/doug-mastriano-election-lies-disinformation-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was actively involved in the “Stop the Steal” movement</a> — protests pushing the false belief that the 2020 election was stolen. He hosted a policy meeting with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in November 2020 to discuss voter-fraud conspiracy theories, and he helped fund travel for participants to attend the Jan. 6 protest in D.C. So it’s not surprising that he joined fellow election deniers in the rally that day, though he says he did not cross any police barriers or enter the building. The House Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack subpoenaed Mastriano, who then refused to testify and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/01/mastriano-lawsuit-jan6-committee-00054554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued the committee</a>. In the race for Pennsylvania governor, Mastriano has been struggling to keep up with the Democratic nominee, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Mastriano has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 5-in-100 chance</a> of becoming the new governor of the Keystone State, according to our forecast. </p>



<h2><strong>Jo Rae Perkins: U.S. Senate, Oregon</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that Perkins attended the Jan. 6 rally is probably not shocking if you’re familiar with the perennial candidate. Perkins, who was <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/ex-senate-candidate-jo-rae-perkins-among-trump-supporters-in-dc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the Capitol on Jan. 6 but says she did not enter</a> the building, unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020. After winning the Republican Senate primary in 2020, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jo-rae-perkins-oregon-republican-senate-primary-winner-thanks-qanon-for-victory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she thanked followers of QAnon</a> — the false conspiracy theory that there is a secret cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles made up of Democratic elites and Hollywood celebrities. Less than a week after losing that race to incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, she announced <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/oregon/election-results-spur-conspiracies-and-unrest-in-oregons-capitol/article_7d4c06c0-2175-11eb-aecc-d3a4d9902641.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a “Stop the Steal” rally</a> her intent to run for U.S. Senate again, this time challenging longtime Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden. Perkins is likely in for yet another disappointment: Our forecast gives her <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a less than 1-in-100 shot</a> of winning. </p>



<h2><strong>George Santos: New York’s 3rd District </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Santos, a Wall Street investor, is the Republican nominee for an open seat representing this district, which spans a northwest part of Long Island. Santos <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/watch-the-right-view-with-lara-trump-bernie-kerik/id1545052064?i=1000509886205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said he was “at the Ellipse on Jan. 6”</a> and called the crowd (some of whom went on to break into the Capitol building) “amazing,” but he has more recently called the riot “<a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/zimmerman-santos-congress-new-york-ly28so9a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dark day in America</a>” and refused to provide details about where he was during the attack. Our forecast gives Santos <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 26-in-100 chance</a> of winning against his Democratic opponent, former congressional aide Robert Zimmerman.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243464144-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243464144-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243464144-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243464144-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Sandy Smith, who tweeted out a video of herself at the Jan. 6 rally, is running for election in North Carolina’s blue-leaning 1st District. <p>ALLISON JOYCE / GETTY IMAGES</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Sandy Smith: North Carolina’s 1st District </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">A business executive and entrepreneur, Smith previously ran to represent this district in 2020, challenging longtime Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield. She lost by 9 percentage points then, but she is back this year hoping to replace the retiring Butterfield. Smith attended the Jan. 6 rally, <a href="https://twitter.com/SandySmithNC/status/1347016673115709440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeting a video amidst the crowd</a> and saying she believed Trump won the election (he did not). But even without facing an incumbent, Smith has an uphill battle in this blue-leaning district. Our forecast gives her just <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/north-carolina/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 4-in-100 chance</a> of winning against the Democratic candidate, state Sen. Don Davis. </p>



<h2><strong>Derrick Van Orden: Wisconsin’s 3rd District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Van Orden is a retired Navy SEAL who ran for Congress in this expansive district in 2020, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-wisconsin-house-district-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing by just 3 points</a> to incumbent Democratic Rep. Ron Kind. On Jan. 6, Van Orden was in D.C. “for meetings and to stand for the integrity of our electoral system as a citizen and at the behest of my neighbors here in Western Wisconsin,” <a href="https://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/derrick-van-orden-we-need-abraham-lincoln-now-more-than-ever/article_f29c4153-a584-54df-9d07-b6092ab38d57.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to an op-ed he wrote after</a> the riot. Van Orden said he stood at the perimeter and watched the attack begin. He wrote that he left when “it became clear that a protest had become a mob,” and said he was “disturbed” by the ensuing attack. Now, with Kind retiring, Van Orden is taking another run at the seat and is leading the Democratic candidate, state Sen. Brad Pfaff. Our forecast gives Van Orden <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/wisconsin/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 85-in-100 chance</a> of winning. </p>



<h2><strong>Jeff Zink: Arizona’s 3rd District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Jan. 6, Zink and his son participated in the protest outside of the Capitol, though the elder Zink says <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona-republic/2021/01/08/stories-arizonans-who-were-u-s-capitol-day-breached/6604727002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he only stood on the steps outside of the Capitol</a> and did not go inside. His son <a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2021/02/05/ttu-student-son-az-congressional-candidate-accused-participation-capitol-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was later arrested and charged</a> with trespassing, assault and damaging property (he has <a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/local-news/new-developments-in-case-against-lubbock-man-charged-for-january-6-capital-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded not guilty</a>). Zink condemned the violence of the riot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feQEG08O0H4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but also spoke out in defense of individuals arrested</a> for alleged involvement in the attack. Zink is challenging incumbent Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego and has an uphill battle in this deep-blue district, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+44</a>. Our forecast gives Zink <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/arizona/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a less than 1-in-100</a> chance of unseating Gallego.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this is only a sample — there are even more candidates running <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/29/metro/right-wing-agitator-who-attended-jan-6-riot-is-running-mass-house-testing-state-gops-appetite-extremism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for state</a> and <a href="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article248787235.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local offices</a> who also attended the Jan. 6 rally, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/28/january-6-candidate-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some who have faced charges</a> for their alleged participation in the riots that followed. There’s also Max Miller, the Republican candidate for Ohio’s 7th District, who helped plan the rally as a member of Trump’s White House, though it’s unclear if he was physically there that day. (Our forecast gives Miller a 98-in-100 chance of winning.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Stay tuned for our coverage of the races featuring Jan. 6 attendees — in addition to all candidates who have denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election — in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Four years ago, Stacey Abrams had the world at her feet. Yes, she had just lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race to Gov. Brian Kemp by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/us/politics/abrams-kemp-2018-debate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer than 60,000 votes</a> — but after such an unexpectedly tight contest, she was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/5/18211154/stacey-abrams-state-of-union-2019-response-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heralded by the Democratic Party</a> as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/us/politics/on-politics-stacey-abrams-sotu-response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a promising new leader</a>. There was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/14/biden-running-mate-stacey-abrams-underdog-push-for-vp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation about whether she’d be chosen</a> as Joe Biden’s running mate during his 2020 bid for the presidency (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/us/politics/stacey-abrams-vice-president.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a prospect Abrams welcomed</a>), and she was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-democrats-may-have-found-their-own-southern-strategy-a-black-centric-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely credited</a> for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pioneering a new playbook</a> focused on turning out Black voters in Georgia, especially after Biden flipped the state in 2020. Though Biden eventually tapped then-Sen. Kamala Harris of California to share the ticket, Abrams kept her eyes on the governor’s mansion. But she enters this year’s race as even more of an underdog <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-democrat-aims-to-be-nations-first-female-african-american-governor/2017/06/03/7c5a7c2a-4833-11e7-a196-a1bb629f64cb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than she was in 2018</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most recent surveys of the race consistently show Abrams, a former minority leader in Georgia’s state House, trailing Kemp by single digits, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a> as of this past Friday at 12 p.m. Eastern. (All data in this article is as of this date and time.) An October poll from <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/10/dfp_ga_midterm_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data for Progress</a>, though, found that the Republican held a lead of 10 percentage points over Abrams — 3 points more than when <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/9/dfp_ga_midterm_toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the firm last polled the race</a>, in September. And while Abrams had stronger support among Democrats than Kemp did with Republicans, according to a September <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_ga_092222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University</a> survey, the pollsters also concluded that Abrams’s path to victory this year was “much narrower.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abrams’s campaign is also <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2022/09/29/two-dem-stars-struggle-to-recapture-the-magic-00059662" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracting a lot less buzz</a> this year compared with the frenetic excitement of her candidacy in 2018. That stands out because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s a significant gap</a> between Abrams’s polling against Kemp versus that of Sen. Raphael Warnock, another Democrat on the ballot, who is running for reelection against Republican Herschel Walker. According to our database, no recent nonpartisan polls give Walker a lead. Most nonpartisan surveys, especially those fielded following <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walker’s abortion controversy</a>, have given Warnock a single-digit edge. In fact, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average</a> is almost 2 points in Warnock’s favor. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a> of the election, meanwhile, has assessed the race as a toss-up.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the governor’s race, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Deluxe forecast gives</a> Kemp about a 9-in-10 chance of being reelected, as of this past Friday at 12 p.m. Eastern. Because Abrams is a Black woman seeking statewide office in the South, <a href="https://www.insider.com/georgia-midterm-elections-black-women-politics-diversity-sexism-racism-bias-2022-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexism and racism</a> are likely to blame for some of her underperformance — but not all of it. Abrams’s lackluster polling can also be attributed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/black-men-are-showing-tepid-enthusiasm-for-stacey-abrams-in-georgia-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the tepid enthusiasm</a> for her candidacy among Black men. Plus, unlike in 2018, when she was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/georgia-gubernatorial-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running for an open seat</a>, she’s now up against <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-2022-midterm-elections-stacey-abrams-biden-georgia-a46b3c9fc7192682fea51078dc4a490c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an incumbent</a> who <a href="https://time.com/6220287/brian-kemp-georgia-governor-race-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has proven himself</a> to be a <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/gov-kemp-economic-development-georgia/85-cb733793-d4ce-432e-a0b9-a7eb7c8be556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deft politician while in office</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/fivethirtyeight-midterm-model-weeks-left-92348137</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">“Incumbency still matters,” said <a href="https://spia.uga.edu/faculty-member/gbemende-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gbemende Johnson</a>, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. “On top of that, Kemp now has a record that he can run on, so the conditions are quite different for Abrams than they were in 2018.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, a loss for Abrams this year could be less about her shortcomings as a candidate and more about a number of baked-in advantages playing to Kemp’s favor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one, Kemp’s <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relative popularity as governor</a> is a boon to his candidacy. Plus, in his race against Abrams, he’s <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2022-08-10/gov-kemp-georgia-shatters-investment-and-job-records-fy22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">played into issues important to Georgians</a> — like the economy and inflation — as a political point to keep him in office. Abrams, meanwhile, has been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-stacey-abrams-voting-georgia-atlanta-f3051f5da33a65d6a0b34883be918ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking a lot about abortion</a> — and even though a six-week ban on abortion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/us/georgia-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went into effect in July</a>, that issue appears to be less salient for Georgia voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s also working in Kemp’s favor is that the political environment in 2022 is <em>much</em> different than it was four years ago, when Republicans controlled the White House. Back then, Democrats could largely run on <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction</a> with Donald Trump and work to tie their challengers <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/brian-kemp-enlists-donald-trump-in-the-effort-to-build-a-big-red-beautiful-wall-around-georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the former president</a>. But Trump isn’t in the White House this year. And in the time since 2018, Kemp has lost favor with the former president after he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/12/brian-kemp-trump-election-georgia-00061347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resisted pressure to overturn the results</a> of the 2020 election. He also had to beat back <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/24/1100739768/georgia-trump-kemp-perdue-abrams-primary-election-lies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Trump-backed primary challenger</a>, former Sen. David Perdue, in May. In doing so, Kemp may have broken slightly with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-majority-of-republican-voters-actively-want-trump-to-run-for-president-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the mainstream of the GOP</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not hard for someone to position themselves to the left of Trump, particularly when ‘to the left’ simply means that you won’t overturn an election,” said <a href="https://cas.gsu.edu/profile/periloux-peay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Periloux Peay</a>, a professor of political science at Georgia State University. “That does not mean that [Kemp] is, by any means, a moderate or even someone who leans conservative. He’s a staunch Republican.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if his policies are very conservative, Johnson said, Kemp’s show of independence from Trump could still help him. “You could imagine, for example, that there are voters on the more moderate side who may have slight preferences for Democratic policies but still want to give Kemp credit for his performance or the performance of the economy in Georgia,” she said. “You might say, ‘He’s not necessarily my cup of tea, but at least he was not willing to interfere in an election in the way the previous president wanted him to.’” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we’ve reported previously</a>, Georgia’s electorate is ideologically calcified by race and geography. In short, that means it’s likely that Abrams will win an overwhelming majority of Black voters, while Kemp will likely perform better with rural, white voters. That dynamic exists primarily because the demographics of the Peach State have changed drastically in the past two decades, thanks to an inflow of new Black residents. So whether this contest is close may come down to how many Black voting-age Georgians cast their ballots. What’s working against Abrams, however, is that she’s reportedly struggling to make inroads with Black men, who might be <a href="https://www.wabe.org/stacey-abrams-looks-to-win-black-men-in-bid-for-georgia-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving slightly toward Republicans</a>. Abrams, for her part, has tried to account for that by hosting conversations called “Stacey and the Fellas” to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfowler/2022/09/12/stacy-abrams-talks-georgia--gubernatorial-race-and-expanding-the-electorate-days-before-the-midterms/?sh=52bd6f964076" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engage Black men</a> in the state. But it’s not clear whether her efforts are paying off: <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/10/dfp_ga_midterm_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">At least one survey</a> showed Kemp netting 15 percent of the Black vote.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/candidates-sitting-debates-voters-care-fivethirtyeight-92297212</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">It could also be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/us/politics/stacey-abrams-georgia-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder for Abrams</a> — compared with Warnock — to appeal to independent or moderate Republican voters who are disillusioned with the GOP but don’t want to support a progressive candidate. That’s because not only does she not have a statewide record to run on, but also there are longstanding stereotypes about female <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2015/10/19/black-candidates-are-perceived-as-more-liberal-than-similar-white-candidates-and-this-may-be-hurting-them-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black politicians</a> being <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912908322416?journalCode=prqb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived as progressive</a>, even if that’s not necessarily the case. Plus, conservatives have spent the last four years painting Abrams <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/trump-calls-georgia-gop-gov-candidate-kemp-extraordinary-amid-vote-n931076" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a far-left bogey(wo)man</a>. At times, too, Abrams has seemingly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/abrams-warnock-pursue-different-strategies-key-georgia-races-rcna52544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled to find her place</a> within the Democratic Party. While she’s taken more progressive stances as of late <a href="https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1581622067891343360" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on issues like reparations</a> to Black Americans as a restitution for slavery, her record as a state legislator was<em> </em>marked by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/us/politics/stacey-abrams-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan negotiation</a>.<strong> </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other issues facing Abrams this year are largely out of her control. The state’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-georgias-new-voting-law-is-such-a-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictive new voting law</a> could dampen turnout among voters of color, and Biden <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/13/bidens-net-approval-rating-is-underwater-in-45-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could also be a drag</a> on both Abrams’s and Warnock’s candidacies since his approval ratings in the state are well below both Democrats’ numbers, according to an October <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a> survey. Per the poll, just 44 percent of likely voters in the state approved of Biden’s job performance, while 51 percent approved of Warnock’s performance and 48 percent had a favorable opinion of Abrams.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Kemp … may have some success linking his rival to Biden’s policies, especially among voters who are unhappy with what’s happening at the national level,” Johnson said. “That’s what I’ve seen in terms of the opposition’s narrative around Stacey Abrams — a sentiment that a vote for her would send the state in the wrong direction.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the race for governor might be closer than we think. So far, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/25/georgia-early-vote-election-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turnout in Georgia</a> is higher than it was four years ago, and the early vote <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/10/24/georgias-early-voting-turnout-so-far-blacker-older-recent-general-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently shows</a> a higher share of Black people voting this year than at this time in previous elections. “If Stacey Abrams is going to win or come close to winning, it’ll likely be because of early in-person voting or absentee ballots,” Peay said. “I wouldn’t be surprised to find that Stacey Abrams has a lead going into election night, and then it tightens as the night goes on.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the end, the outcome of Georgia’s gubernatorial race may come down to the fact that the environment is simply better for Kemp. Abrams can’t be counted out completely, but a win for her this year <em>does </em>seem far-fetched — especially compared with 2018.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The same day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, Alabama’s law banning abortion took effect. The next morning, phones began ringing in Georgia. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We got nearly 100 calls the day after the Dobbs decision from patients in Alabama,” said Kwajelyn Jackson, executive director of the Feminist Women’s Health Center in Atlanta. In states where abortion remains at least partially legal the phones haven’t stopped ringing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since June, thousands of Americans have crossed state lines seeking abortion, like a pressure wave spreading out from a blast zone. A data set shared exclusively with FiveThirtyEight shows that in the two months after the Supreme Court decision, there were 10,670 fewer abortions as compared to pre-Dobbs estimates. That figure is a net, counting both declines in some states and increases in others, and it shows how a few states are absorbing some — but not all — of the demand for abortions in states where it’s now banned. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Abortions rose just before Dobbs, then fell" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YFWgo/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The results suggest that in July and August, there were more than 10,000 people who “felt they had no options,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor and public health social scientist at the University of California, San Francisco. Along with Dr. Alison Norris, a professor of epidemiology at the Ohio State University, she co-chairs #WeCount, a <a href="https://societyfp.org/wecount/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national research project</a> led by the Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit that supports research on abortion and contraception. “They couldn't travel, and they had to figure out what else to do,” Upadhyay said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Data compiled by #WeCount is designed to capture state-level information on abortion access in the wake of the Dobbs decision. This <a href="https://www.societyfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SFPWeCountReport_AprtoAug2022_ReleaseOct2022-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first data release</a> compares the number of legal abortions — including surgical and medication abortions — in each month from April to August 2022, showing how the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June has reshaped the abortion landscape. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That topline number conceals an enormous amount of fluctuation between states. In all states that saw declines in their abortion numbers — which include the 15 states in which abortion was banned or severely limited over the summer — the number of abortions fell by about 22,000.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This figure is based off #WeCount’s rounded estimates of the total number of abortions in each state and Washington, D.C. #WeCount provided monthly numbers of abortions provided by clinicians nationwide from April to August 2022. They received data from 100 percent of abortion providers in 29 states. In states where data from clinics was incomplete, the researchers used the data from available clinics and imputed the missing number of abortions each month from missing clinics by using estimates from several information sources, including state-level Guttmacher Institute data in 2020, state health departments, news articles, contacts known to missing clinics and knowledge of abortion volume by state. Self-managed abortions done without clinical support were not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> Some of those women appear to have traveled out of state, because in other states, the number of abortions rose by an aggregate of about 12,000. </p>

Between April and August, the number of abortions declined by 6 percent, and it’s likely that the decline in abortions represents thousands of women who sought abortions illegally or didn’t get one at all. If these trends persist, there could be at least 60,000 fewer abortions in the next year as a result of the Dobbs decision.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even before the Dobbs ruling, getting an abortion <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/abortion-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was often an arduous, time-consuming and expensive process</a> — particularly in Southern and Midwestern states that passed hundreds of restrictions on abortion in the past decade. In 2018, researchers at UCSF <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5972217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified 27 “abortion deserts”</a> — cities with populations of more than 50,000 where the nearest abortion clinic was more than 100 miles away. Those preexisting reductions in access mean, Norris said, that their data shows a “decline from a very diminished place already.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court’s decision, though, turned entire regions of the country into abortion deserts. By the end of August, 11 states had banned abortion completely and four more had restricted it early in the first trimester.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion was banned in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas for all or most of July and August. Nineteenth-century bans on abortion were still on the books in Arizona and Wisconsin when Roe was overturned, and there were disputes in both states about whether the laws were still valid, but most or all abortion providers in both states stopped services during July and August because of the legal uncertainty. Abortion was banned until about six weeks of pregnancy in Georgia, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee for all or most of July and August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2022/10/100-days-post-roe-least-66-clinics-across-15-us-states-have-stopped-offering-abortion-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the Guttmacher Institute</a>, at least 66 clinics closed between the Dobbs decision and the end of October. </p>

Even before the ban, West Virginia’s lone abortion clinic was performing fewer abortions since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, in part because the state briefly banned abortion in July, as well. <p>Leah Willingham / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The #WeCount data suggests that thousands of Americans traveled long distances to obtain abortions in July and August. In just those 15 states where abortion was either banned or became illegal after six weeks in the wake of Dobbs, there was a reduction of approximately 21,000 abortions relative to April and May. In some states with total bans, like Alabama and Mississippi, the number of abortions fell to zero in July; in others, the numbers were drastically reduced but clinics were able to serve reduced numbers of patients due to court orders or slightly less stringent restrictions. Clustered together across the South and Upper Midwest, these states formed blocs where obtaining an abortion required leaving the region, rather than crossing a single border.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monthly change in abortion numbers is being measured relative to April because there is no national data tracking abortions by month for previous years. Broadly, annual data tracked by the Guttmacher Institute has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/24/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-u-s-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the annual number of abortions has been on the rise&lt;/a&gt; since 2017, after falling for more than two decades. Guttmacher’s most recent figures, from 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/06/long-term-decline-us-abortions-reverses-showing-rising-need-abortion-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;counted 930,160 abortions&lt;/a&gt;, or a monthly average of 77,513. In contrast, #WeCount estimated a monthly total of about 85,000 abortions in April 2022 and 79,600 abortions in August. But the researchers were confident this still represented a real loss of access, both because past trends predict that the number of abortions would have grown between 2020 and 2022; and because the sample set #WeCount uses is different than Guttmacher’s, including, for example, telehealth providers that are not captured in previous Guttmacher data.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/txpep/files/2022/03/TxPEP-out-of-state-SB8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That trend began nearly a year earlier</a>, after the Supreme Court allowed Texas to enforce a ban on abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy in September 2021. Patients from Texas are now regularly seen in clinics as far away as Minnesota, and clinics in the lower Plains states began to see a domino effect in appointment scheduling. “Texas was going to Oklahoma and then Oklahoma started coming to us,” said Ashley Brink, director of the Trust Women clinic in Wichita, Kansas. After Oklahoma <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/26/1101428347/oklahoma-governor-signs-the-nations-strictest-abortion-ban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned abortion in May</a>, a full month before the Dobbs ruling, Brink said that her clinic ended up with more than 50 percent of the patients coming from out of state. </p>

Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who studies abortion, has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/it-can-already-take-weeks-to-get-an-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since March</a> been monitoring wait times at clinics in states where abortion remained legal. She found that by early August, only two of Kansas’s five abortion clinics were scheduling appointments, and the first available times were eight and 13 weekdays away.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since March, Myers and a team of student researchers have been calling every abortion clinic in Myers’s database of abortion providers who advertise their services publicly. In their calls, the researchers pose as pregnant women, saying they’re about six weeks pregnant and want the nearest possible abortion appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> That month, the median wait time in Colorado and New Mexico was over two weeks. Waits for appointments at abortion clinics in southern Illinois were also higher than they were earlier in the summer. In August, 74 percent of patients at Planned Parenthood’s clinic in Asheville, North Carolina, came from outside the state, and the average wait time for a medication abortion was three weeks, <a href="https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/ppsat_v._moore_20cvs500147_pls_memo_of_law_iso_mot._for_partial_preliminary_injunction.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a recent legal filing</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Someone who lives three minutes, three miles from our clinic, is struggling to get an appointment and is now getting displaced to Colorado or Illinois,” Brink said. Travel comes with a different set of difficulties: <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/txpep/files/2022/03/TxPEP-out-of-state-SB8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Texas study</a> conducted in the aftermath of the state’s six-week ban found that some women who left the state delayed rent or bills to cover the cost, or were even fired because of their extended time away from work. And some states, like Kansas and Pennsylvania, still require prospective abortion patients to comply with waiting periods and other logistical hurdles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A likely consequence of longer wait times and travel distances is more abortions later in pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that only <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.7 percent of all abortions happen between the 14th and 20th week</a> of pregnancy. But between 20 and 30 percent of current patients are in the second trimester at Whole Woman's Health of Minnesota, a clinic located in a state where abortion is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.minnpost.com/health/2022/07/does-minnesota-law-have-a-viability-threshold-limiting-abortion-well-that-depends/" target="_blank">legal until the point of fetal viability</a> around 25 weeks, according to Sean Mehl, Whole Woman's assistant director of clinical services.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the traffic jams backing up service in clinics, the #WeCount data shows that the number of abortions nationwide did briefly increase in the weeks before the Dobbs ruling, as clinics across the country crammed patients into their schedules, accomodating as many as possible while abortion remained legal nationwide. Although abortion rates <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010782416303997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually dip a bit during the summer</a>, the number of abortions this year rose 4 percent from May to June. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Georgia, where there was no trigger law but where restrictions were almost certainly imminent, clinics kept up that pace after Dobbs for as long as they could. According to the #WeCount data, abortions in Georgia declined only 6 percent from June to July, despite the fact that a federal court allowed the state’s six-week abortion ban to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/us/georgia-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go into effect on July 20</a>. The number of abortions dropped by more than 50 percent from July to August. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1241616426-711.jpg" alt='A pin reading "Welcome to Illinois" hangs on a basket at the Hope Clinic for Women' data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1241616426-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1241616426-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1241616426-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption><p>ANGELA WEISS / AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Where abortion remains legal, some abortion providers have been able to increase capacity. Staffing wasn’t an issue for Whole Woman’s Health in Minnesota or Trust Women in Kansas — by the summer, they were flying in doctors from across the country to fill in their schedules, with more people reaching out to see if they could volunteer. “Since Dobbs, our Minnesota clinic has seen about a 50 percent increase in overall patients,” Mehl said. Virtual abortion providers, which can prescribe abortion pills online in the states where it’s legal to do so, also ramped up their medication abortion services. The #WeCount researchers found that the number of abortions offered through online-only clinics — not counting telehealth abortions offered through brick-and-mortar facilities — increased by 33 percent between April and August.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some women may also be getting abortions without any clinic or doctor being involved — although those numbers are hard to track. The #WeCount data counts only <em>legal</em> abortions, which means it’s almost certainly underestimating the total number. Even before Dobbs, activist groups and online pharmacies <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/european-doctor-prescribes-abortion-pills-u-s-women-over-internet-n1012676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were providing abortion pills</a> directly to consumers through the mail. By July, Mexican activists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/world/americas/abortion-pills-mexico-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were already reporting</a> that they were inundated with requests for abortion pills from women all over the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also likely that some people who might have gotten an abortion in the pre-Dobbs era are simply carrying their pregnancies to term. And while that is a victory for anti-abortion advocates, the #WeCount researchers noted that there is substantial evidence that being denied a wanted abortion puts people at <a href="https://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/the_harms_of_denying_a_woman_a_wanted_abortion_4-16-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an increased risk of poverty, physical abuse and certain health problems</a>. They’re also keeping an eye on whether maternal and infant mortality will increase in states with abortion bans — particularly since <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/overturning-roe-v-wade-could-make-maternal-mortality-even-worse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those states tend to have higher-than-average rates</a> of deaths from pregnancy complications.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Norris said it’s possible that out-of-state travel might get more difficult as time goes by. Abortion funds <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/us/abortion-funds-donations-roe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised millions of dollars</a> in the aftermath of Dobbs, which may have made it more possible for women to travel than it was in the past. But over time, volunteers’ enthusiasm or financial support to organizations like abortion funds might start to ebb. “We don’t know if it’s sustainable,” Norris said. And with more states poised to implement abortion bans in the next few months, the numbers from this report are just an early signal of a future where abortions could be even more scarce.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Nov. 1, 12:23 p.m.):</strong> After publication, #WeCount updated its topline estimate for the change in how many people were able to obtain abortion care in the two months following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The number is now 10,670, not 10,570, after the organization accounted for rounding in state-level estimates.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">With less than two weeks until Election Day, Republicans now have a 48 percent chance of taking the Senate, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, their highest figure since late July and putting the battle for Senate control <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-is-a-toss-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially in toss-up territory</a>. But whether that shift will continue or has peaked is in the eye of the beholder.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most recently, the GOP hasn’t seen the rapid gains in the forecast that they did a week or two ago, and if you scroll through our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest polls page</a>, you can find <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_ga_102622/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a</a> <a href="https://www.bw.edu/news/2022/fall/us-senate-race-remains-close-in-final-bw-ohio-pulse-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decent</a> <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/10/dfp_nh_midterm_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number</a> of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/politics/cnn-poll-senate-races-wisconsin-pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> that have good news for Democrats along with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite a few others</a> that look strong for Republicans. Still, the current picture leaves Democrats without much margin to spare. Unless they can pull off an upset in North Carolina, Ohio, or Wisconsin, Democrats will need to win two of the three closest Senate races — Georgia, Pennsylvania and Nevada — in order to maintain their majority, while also holding Arizona and New Hampshire.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the House, meanwhile, Republicans have an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81 percent chance of taking over the chamber</a>, putting Democrats in a tough — although hardly impossible — position. (<a href="http://twodimes.net/poker/?g=h&amp;b=&amp;d=&amp;h=Ac+Ad%0D%0A5c+5d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In poker terms</a>, it’s as though they have pocket 5’s against pocket aces.) Unlike in the Senate, Democrats will have to do more than just win the majority of toss-up races to control the House. In fact, there are now 219 seats that our model rates as lean Republican, likely Republican or solid Republican, one more than the 218 needed for a majority. So even if Democrats won <em>all</em> the toss-ups, it wouldn’t quite be enough.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, in practice, in an election where things are going well enough for Democrats to win all the toss-ups, they’d probably pick up their fair share of lean Republican seats too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> To keep the House, Democrats will need for our model to be systematically underestimating them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That can happen — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast and polling errors are correlated</a>. That said, what the <em>polls</em> say and what the FiveThirtyEight <em>forecast</em> says are not quite the same. Most importantly, our Deluxe forecast already assumes the Republicans probably <em>will</em> beat what polls currently show.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Below, you can find a comparison between the FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> for each Senate race where we calculate a polling average, and the projected margin of victory or defeat in the same races according to the Deluxe forecast:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In Ohio, for instance, Democrat Tim Ryan trails by only 1.4 percentage points in our polling average, but is projected to lose by 4.5 points, which implies a 3-point polling bias against Republican J.D. Vance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s on the high side for the competitive Senate races, but the Deluxe forecast does expect Republicans to somewhat overperform their polls in most of the other competitive races: by 1 to 2 points in Georgia and North Carolina, and by about 1 point in Wisconsin, Nevada and Pennsylvania. It doesn’t expect much polling bias in Arizona and New Hampshire, by contrast.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some of the less competitive races, the Deluxe forecasts thinks the bias could be more severe. Check out Iowa, Missouri and Oklahoma, for instance, where Republicans are projected to do much better than their polling — although there are relatively few recent polls of Missouri and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, Democrats are expected to outperform their polls in blue-state races such as Washington, Connecticut, Illinois and New York.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To some degree, this <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matches the pattern from previous years</a>, although not perfectly so.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aren’t expecting an especially large polling error in Wisconsin, for instance, where polls were poor in 2016 and 2020 — although the polls have Republican Ron Johnson ahead there anyway, so he doesn’t need a polling error to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> But one fairly good heuristic is simply that Republicans tend to outperform their polls in red states, while Democrats do so in blue states — see the map below for an example of this from 2016.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why do Republicans do better in the forecast than the polling average? There isn’t any built-in <a href="https://gelliottmorris.substack.com/p/the-polling-website-where-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unskewing</a> or assumption of polling bias in the model. Rather, it’s a bunch of little things that tend to add up:</p>



<ul><li>Our forecast makes additional adjustments to the polls beyond what is shown in our polling averages. In particular, this includes a likely voter adjustment and a timeline adjustment, both of which help Republicans at the margin. The likely voter adjustment helps Republicans because they tend to do better in polls of likely voters than registered ones.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we’re at the point now where there are relatively few registered-voter polls of Senate races, so this doesn’t make much difference in most races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> The timeline adjustment accounts for how the generic ballot has shifted since polls were conducted, and since it’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/">shifted in a somewhat Republican direction recently</a>, that tends to help the GOP too.</li><li>In some states — Rust Belt swing states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and redder ones like Iowa and Missouri — the “fundamentals” our model considers are more favorable for Republicans than the polls. The most important of these is simply <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/">overall state partisanship</a>. Republicans have done fairly well in these states in recent years, so you might expect them to do well again in what is likely to be a fairly good year nationally for the party.</li><li>In addition, the model considers macro-level fundamentals, such as the poor historic performance of the president’s party at the midterms, and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">President Biden’s mediocre approval ratings</a>. So the model endorses the idea that Democrats <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/democrats-agonize-2022-election-facing-political-gravity-final-stretch-rcna54148">have been coming back to gravity</a>. These factors zero out in the model by Election Day, though, so they don’t have too much effect now given how close we are to the election.</li><li>Finally, the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">expert ratings</a> that the Deluxe model uses are more bullish for Republicans in several key Senate races than polls and other objective indicators.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">While none of this is good news for Democrats, it should guard against one potential misinterpretation of our forecast. You might be tempted to take the FiveThirtyEight Deluxe forecast, and then mentally shade it further to Republicans because you worry that the polls could underestimate Republicans again. Heck, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’ve even been tempted to do this myself</a>. But the Deluxe forecast <em>already assumes</em> that Republicans will do better than what current polls show, by around 2 percentage points in the average Congressional race. You may be double-counting, in other words, if you take the Deluxe forecast and then assume additional polling bias on top of it. Some of it is already baked into the model.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court is poised to upend <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/when-the-supreme-court-first-ruled-on-affirmative-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades of precedent</a> on affirmative action. This Monday, the justices <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/01/court-will-hear-challenges-to-affirmative-action-at-harvard-and-university-of-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will hear two cases</a> challenging race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. The universities use race as one of many factors when deciding which applicants to accept — a practice that has been <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/76-811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affirmed multiple times</a> by the Supreme Court, including in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2002/02-241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2003 case</a> where the justices ruled that ensuring racial diversity in higher education is important enough to justify the limited use of race in college admissions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, just months after the Supreme Court upended a decades-old precedent on abortion rights, the precedent on affirmative action is <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-supreme-court-appears-ready-finally-to-defeat-affirmative-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in peril</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Although public opinion on abortion is complex</a>, Americans mostly did not want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and end the constitutional right to abortion. But a ruling limiting or ending affirmative action in higher education — though it would have a huge impact on college admissions — is less likely to draw public outrage. That’s because affirmative action is unpopular, even though Americans do want there to be diversity in higher education.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, a <a href="https://docs-cdn-prod.news-engineering.aws.wapo.pub/publish_document/590f3120-fdce-40b3-80b1-8b2ddbc5147d/published/590f3120-fdce-40b3-80b1-8b2ddbc5147d.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post/Schar School poll</a> conducted Oct. 7-10 found that near-identical shares of Americans supported a Supreme Court ruling “banning colleges and universities from considering a student’s race and ethnicity when making decisions about student admissions” (63 percent), <em>and</em> thought programs that promote racial diversity in higher education are a good thing (64 percent). This is a great example of one of the central tensions in how Americans think about race-conscious admissions: Many people are uncomfortable with the concept of singling out racial minorities for special treatment if it means other students will have to meet a higher standard, even though they also want universities to have racially diverse student bodies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ ambivalence about affirmative action is strong enough that a small tweak in question wording can result in a very different result. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/05/4-race-immigration-and-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pew Research Center poll conducted in 2017</a> found that a sizable majority (71 percent) of Americans said that “affirmative action programs designed to increase the number of black and minority students on college campuses” are a good thing. Of course, this number might have changed over the past few years, but it suggests that reminding respondents about the aims of affirmative action programs — rather than simply telling them how race-conscious admissions works, as the Washington Post/Schar School poll did — may change the way people think about the concept.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/04/21/american-attitudes-college-affirmative-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A YouGov poll conducted in April</a> tested this theory and found that framing does matter. When respondents were asked whether they supported or opposed “an affirmative action program for higher education that increases the share of Black and Hispanic students at selective institutions in the United States,” there wasn’t a clear consensus: Thirty-seven percent supported the programs, 34 percent opposed them and 29 percent said they weren’t sure. But a much larger majority (68 percent) said that race should not “be considered when evaluating [a student’s] admission to college,” and a plurality (46 percent) agreed that “[q]ualified minorities” should <em>not</em> be given “special preferences in higher education.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Question wording matters greatly in polls on affirmative action" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NMywM/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="402" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Washington Post/Schar School poll also found that larger shares of Americans thought that white students (62 percent) and Asian students (66 percent) have “a fair chance” of getting into a good college, compared with the shares who thought the same about Black students (43 percent) and Hispanic and Latino students (44 percent). Despite this consensus that discrimination exists in college admissions, Americans are much less likely to favor affirmative action when it’s framed as a zero-sum game. (This feeling that the playing field should be level extends beyond affirmative action: The Washington Post/Schar School poll found Americans were overwhelmingly likely to oppose preferential treatment for applicants whose parents went to the same school.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">YouGov also conducted an experiment as part of their April poll, asking half the sample what they thought about an affirmative action program that would “increase the share of Black and Hispanic students,” while asking the other half what they thought about an affirmative action program that would “decrease the share of Asian and white students.” Respondents who said they supported “affirmative action in college admissions” (an earlier question in the poll) were much more likely to say they supported a program increasing the share of Black and Hispanic students (70 percent) than a program decreasing the share of Asian and white students (37 percent), indicating that even those in favor of race-conscious admissions in theory don’t like the idea of giving some students a boost at other racial and ethnic groups’ expense.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what does all of this mean for the Supreme Court? The two cases facing the justices raise slightly different issues: <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/222325/20220502145522418_20-1199%2021-707%20SFFA%20Brief%20to%20file%20final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard is accused</a> of unconstitutionally discriminating against Asian American applicants through its race-conscious process, while <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-707/234417/20220824170858314_21-707%20Reply%20Brief%20Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the challenge against UNC-Chapel Hill argues</a> that considering race in admissions violates civil rights law and the Constitution. As the cases have unfolded, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universities across the country</a> have weighed in, many saying that race-conscious admissions actually are the best way to ensure a racially diverse student body — and that without it, there will be fewer minority students at selective schools. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even though the justices <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-981_4g15.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled only six years ago</a> that the University of Texas could consider race in its admissions process, the court is much more conservative now, and it seems likely that the justices will limit how universities can use race as a factor for admissions, or ban it entirely. And if that happens, many Americans may think that’s the right outcome — particularly if the justices say they’re acting to protect Asian American students from discrimination.</p>



<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>Early voting for the midterm elections is underway <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/25/georgia-early-vote-election-2022/">in some states</a>. According to a recently released <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403052/eight-americans-favor-early-voting-photo-laws.aspx">Gallup poll</a>, which was conducted in July, a heavy majority of Americans (78 percent) favored early-voting options, although there is a partisan split, with early voting supported by 95 percent of Democrats but only 60 percent of Republicans. Americans of color (84 percent) were also more likely than white Americans (76 percent) to agree. Furthermore, the poll found a wide gap along racial lines related to absentee ballots: While three-quarters (75 percent) of Americans of color supported sending absentee ballots to all eligible voters, just over half of white Americans (53 percent) endorsed the same. </li><li>An <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/half-of-america-expecting-fraud-in-midterm-elections-poll-finds/3186528/">LX News/YouGov poll</a> conducted Oct. 12-14 found that roughly half of Americans (49 percent) believed there will be at least some voter fraud in the midterms. That number jumped to 71 percent among Republicans and 78 percent among those who said they voted for Trump in 2020. An equal share of both groups (34 percent) believed fraud could be rampant enough to impact control of Congress. Specifically, a large share of 2020 Trump voters were at least somewhat concerned that illegal ballots will be cast by people lying about citizenship status (84 percent), trying to vote more than once (81 percent) or using a fake name (80 percent).</li><li>A plurality of Americans (44 percent) said that supporting Iranians demonstrating for women’s rights was more important than reentering a nuclear deal with the nation, <a href="https://tippinsights.com/shock-poll-americans-prioritize-womens-rights-in-iran-over-nuclear-deal-after-mahsa-aminis-murder/">per an Oct. 5-7 TIPP poll</a>. Just 24 percent expressed the opposite, with an additional 31 percent of Americans not sure. The prioritization of civil liberties over nuclear treaties held true regardless of political affiliation, with 50 percent of Democrats, 43 percent of independents and 40 percent of Republicans saying supporting women’s rights protestors was more important. This suggests that Americans are paying attention to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/iranians-are-ready-for-a-different-approach-to-religion-and-government/">ongoing protests in Iran</a> after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in the custody of the country’s “morality police.” Prior to that event, TIPP polling from July shows that a majority of Americans (55 percent) wanted the Biden administration to make a nuclear deal with Iran. </li><li>Americans are divided over which country poses the greatest national security threat to the United States, according to a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2022/10/25/17e1e/1">YouGov poll</a> conducted on Oct. 25. Two-thirds were roughly split between choosing China (34 percent) and Russia (30 percent), while the rest were either not sure (16 percent) or divvied up among less popular choices, like North Korea (8 percent), Iran (4 percent) and Afghanistan (3 percent). But there is also a partisan division at play: Half of Republicans said China was the greatest national security threat, while 43 percent of Democrats named Russia. </li></ul><h2>Biden approval</h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Election Day is almost here, and millions around the country have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/politics/pre-election-early-absentee-voting-midterms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already cast their vote</a>. With this in mind, we wanted to use the last wave of our <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a> before the midterm elections to dive deeper into which issues are driving Americans’ decision-making in the final weeks of the campaign. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we’ve been asking the same 2,000 Americans about their biggest concerns and what they think about both major parties in the lead-up to the elections. This time around, we devoted much of our time analyzing the views of likely voters. We examined how different issues could affect their vote choices, their attitudes toward Democrats or Republicans and their perceptions of the parties’ values.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In each of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/american-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our surveys this year</a>, “inflation or increasing costs” has ranked as the most important concern for the country, and it was no different this time around, as 65 percent of Americans selected that issue.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted Oct. 13-23, 2022, among 1,540 respondents. As was the case in the previous waves of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple-choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. The sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> This marked a new high in any of our six waves of issue polling, an indication that concerns about inflation have risen ahead of the election — a potentially beneficial political development for Republicans, who as the out-party can capitalize on the public’s economic concerns. Rounding out the top three issues were “political extremism or polarization” (32 percent) and “crime or gun violence” (28 percent). Meanwhile, “immigration” and “climate change” ranked fourth and fifth at 21 percent and 16 percent.</p>

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> Overall, our poll found likely voters split evenly at 41 percent over whether they planned to vote for a Democrat or a Republican in the upcoming congressional election, about the same as in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our September wave</a>. But because most likely voters will vote Democratic or Republican, we asked the other respondents — those who were undecided, planned to vote for an independent or third-party candidate, would not vote or skipped the question — which major party they would support if they <em>had</em> to choose, as voters who lean toward one party <a href="https://agadjanianpolitics.wordpress.com/2017/01/02/charting-the-behavior-of-leaners-vs-partisans-from-self-described-partisanship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to vote for that party</a>. Even with those responses incorporated, however, likely voters remained almost evenly divided: Forty-nine percent said they would back a Democratic candidate, and 48 percent a Republican one. Nearly all self-identified Democrats and Republicans planned to vote for their respective parties, while independents preferred Democrats over Republicans, 49 percent to 42 percent.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked to choose between the major parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, in a development that could redound to the GOP’s advantage, 63 percent of likely voters named inflation as a top concern for the country. Republican likely voters have consistently been more likely to name inflation as a leading issue, and 77 percent did so in the sixth wave. But 44 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents also indicated rising costs were a top issue, high-water marks for both groups across our polling. And the latter figure might be especially important because independents who named inflation as a top issue broke 54 percent to 36 percent for Republicans when we asked them to choose a party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while likely voters were split on which party they planned to vote for, they largely felt that neither party had earned the right to govern after November. Overall, 51 percent of likely voters said Democrats hadn’t earned another two years controlling the federal government, while 39 percent said they had.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likely voters could select “yes,” “no,” “don’t know” or skip the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> Among independents, 50 percent said Democrats didn’t deserve another two years and 34 percent said they did, while Democrats and Republicans mostly answered in accordance with their party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet things were no better for the GOP, as 55 percent of likely voters also said Republicans had not made a good case for why they should be given control of Congress for the next two years, compared with 35 percent who said they had. Notably, 61 percent of independents said the GOP had not, while just 27 percent said they had (once again, Democrats and Republicans largely answered in line with their partisan views). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also asked respondents <em>why</em> they felt each party had or hadn’t earned the right to govern. Sixty-eight percent of likely voters who didn’t think the Democratic Party should have continued control said its policies and plans were moving the country in the wrong direction. A 41-year-old Republican multiracial woman from Oklahoma said that Democrats “create tension between groups who feel marginalized at the expense of the country to create an emotional frenzy that will drive people to the polls. I am a former Democrat and feel disgust at the lack of morals or ethics shown by the party.” Among those who thought Democrats should continue to govern, 44 percent cited their belief that Democrats were moving the country in the right direction, while 17 percent cited their work to pass major and important legislation. Another 19 percent also said Democrats should have control simply because they were “better than the Republicans.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Democrats' supporters and critics both point to their policies" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5qTrJ/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="672" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for those who wanted Republicans to control Congress, 51 percent cited GOP policies and plans, while 28 percent answered because “Democrats are ruining the country.” Just 13 percent answered that they thought the GOP would do a better job dealing with the economy, although some voters thinking about inflation or rising costs may have indicated that they broadly preferred Republican policies. Meanwhile, there wasn’t one obvious reason why some likely voters felt the GOP shouldn’t have power: Thirty-six percent said GOP policies and plans would move the country in the wrong direction, 30 percent said Republicans had not presented a clear plan for what they would do in Congress, and 16 percent felt Republican “values and beliefs were bad or wrong.” When asked to describe the values and beliefs of the GOP, a 72-year-old woman from California who identified as a Democrat wrote, “The current group calling themselves the Republican Party are a corrupt group who are no longer disguising their true intentions, which are solely to create immense personal wealth and power for themselves.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Many critics of Republicans want a clearer plan from the GOP" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DW6Vh/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="600" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also wanted to know what voters thought were the values and beliefs of the two major parties. Overall, almost 79 percent of likely voters said they understood the values and beliefs of each party “very” or “somewhat” well, but there were some notable, if unsurprising, differences.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options included “not very well,” “not at all” or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> About 9 in 10 Democrats and Republicans said they knew their party, whereas around two-thirds said the same of the opposition. Meanwhile, about 80 percent of independents said they understood each party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked to describe the values and beliefs of the opposing party, likely voters didn’t hold back. A 28-year-old man from California who identified as a person of color and a Democrat said the GOP aims to “protect the rich and corrupt, lie and gaslight to fool citizens, utilize religion and the media to control the narrative, and reinstate racism and division.” Meanwhile, a 37-year-old white woman from New Hampshire who identified as a Republican argued Democrats “want people dependent on the government” and “are in favor of murdering babies and keeping people poor.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not all negative attitudes toward the opposing party. Some Republicans have drawn a line against their own party on issues such as abortion: “The party has also lost itself in the abortion debate and does not seem to want to understand a balance between fetal rights and women’s reproductive rights and health,” said a 60-year-old white man from Georgia. On the other side of the aisle, a 38-year-old white man from Florida complained about his party, the Democrats, paying “lip service to progressivism while maintaining the status quo.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In less than two weeks, how voters weigh the interplay of these issues, policy preferences and partisan loyalties will help determine the results of the 2022 midterm elections. Republicans have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capturing the House</a>, while control of the Senate looks <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very much up for grabs</a>. After the election, we plan to examine what voters have to say about those results and what they think about our political system moving forward. But until then, we’ll have to wait and see how the midterms play out. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Welcome to </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/invisible-divides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Invisible Divides</em></a><em>, a series exploring the profound differences in worldview between Democrats and Republicans. These beliefs about education, religion, gender, race, and political extremism align with partisanship — but run much deeper. Differences like these don’t just influence the ways Democrats and Republicans vote, but also how they think about their place in America. And they help explain why opposing views on important issues today seem increasingly irreconcilable.</em></p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">After Crystal Vasquez became a Christian, she noticed that people were getting mad at her a lot more. She’d get scolded for responding to a piece of good news with “Praise God!” A friend with a transgender child stopped speaking to her out of the blue, saying that their children couldn’t play together because Vasquez, 34, is Christian. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, in the few short years since converting, Vasquez has come to view Christians’ place in American society very differently than she did before. She said the people around her were acting like she was trying to shove Christianity down their throats when all she wanted to do was express her beliefs and add a little more love to the world. “I think Christians are discriminated against,” Vasquez said. “We act like they have all this power, but really we’re just raising our voices and getting ignored.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the idea that Christians are an increasingly persecuted minority is far from a consensus view — even among Christians themselves. Kathy Watson, 67, is an evangelical Christian but told me she didn’t understand why so many Christians say they’re discriminated against. If anything, she said, Christians have too much power, and use it to inflict a rigid set of values on people who don’t share them. “A lot of evangelical Christians — I think they’ve confused being Christian with being Republican,” she said. “They want to have strict rules and regulations and they want everyone to be like them, and they’re using the political system — the judges they’ve appointed, the politicians they’ve elected — to impose that worldview on other people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a sense, in conversations with voters like Watson and Vasquez, that the country is in the midst of a reckoning over what it means to be Christian in America.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystal Vasquez, Kathy Watson, Becky Carrizales and Scott Barum participated in FiveThirtyEight’s survey with PerryUndem and YouGov. Carolyn Novak participated in an online focus group conducted separately by FiveThirtyEight and PerryUndem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> On one side, there are the people who see Christians <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/the-christians-who-believe-theyre-being-persecuted-in-america/488468/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the victims</a> of a successful campaign to infuse the country with secular values, forcing Christians — particularly conservative ones — to accept values they violently disagree with. But many Americans think Christians occupy a very different role. In their version of the country’s current drama, Christians are the villains, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/us/christian-nationalism-politicians.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ensconcing their own beliefs in law and politics</a> even as their numbers dwindle. There’s a thread of unease on both sides — as if the one thing everyone agrees on is that these two ways of thinking about Christianity in America simply can’t coexist.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/538-PerryUndem-YouGov-Survey_Topline-Results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/PerryUndem/YouGov survey</a> of likely voters shows just how deep this fissure runs.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted Aug. 10-21, 2022, among 1,796 likely voters, including oversamples of Black, Latino and Asian American/Pacific Islander respondents. Likely voters included registered voters who said that they are “almost certain to” or will “probably” vote in the November midterm elections. The sample is weighted to match the general population. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> In this second installment of our exploration of invisible divides — the differences in worldview that shape how people vote and think about their place in America — <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/538-regression-placeholder.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we found profound disagreements</a> about how much power Christians really have, and the role they should play in the country’s politics and culture. Like the other divides we’re exploring, these divisions track fairly neatly along partisan lines and help explain why the gap between Republicans and Democrats sometimes feels unbridgeable: It’s because their ways of thinking about the world are increasingly irreconcilable.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Are Christians victims? It depends on who you ask. Nearly half (46 percent) of survey respondents told us that discrimination against Christians is a problem in American society today, while a majority (54 percent) think it’s not.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked how big of a problem they viewed each topic from a list of 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> They were also divided along similar lines about whether far-right Christians are trying to impose their beliefs on other people: A majority (56 percent) agreed they are, while another 33 percent disagreed, and 10 percent weren’t sure. The political fissures on this question are as wide as religious divides, like church attendance, and sometimes wider — signaling that anxiety about what it means to be Christian may be shaped as much by people’s political allegiances as their religious ties.</p>

Identifying as a Christian was no longer just about theology, community or family history — to many Americans, the label became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/opinion/evangelical-republican.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncomfortably tangled</a> with the Christian Right’s political agenda, which was itself becoming <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/01/1109141110/the-christian-right-is-winning-cultural-battles-while-public-opinion-disagrees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly hard to separate</a> from the GOP’s political agenda. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo28246146.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social scientists have argued compellingly</a> that left-leaning Americans started to reject religious labels altogether around this time <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088891?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of the perception</a> that Christianity was becoming tainted by politics. The rise in the share of Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/modeling-the-future-of-religion-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who have no religion</a> wasn’t just about loss of belief — it was about the rejection of a political identity, too. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-christian-right-is-helping-drive-liberals-away-from-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to this theory</a>, people who had relatively weak ties to religion — the ones who attended church once a month, or twice a year — started slipping away, discomfited by the idea of calling themselves Christians because of the term’s new political baggage. <a href="https://nathanael.id/download/2018-Putting%20Politics%20First.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study found</a> that simply showing participants a newspaper clipping where a Republican politician spoke at a church prompted some Democrats to say they had no religion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Carolyn Novak, 54, didn’t stop calling herself a Christian because she no longer followed Jesus. Instead, she stopped going to the Southern Baptist church she’d attended for years because she felt like it made people assume things about her that weren’t true. She found herself increasingly at odds with her fellow churchgoers. “Being labeled a Christian, [people think] you’re some kind of right-wing nut,” Novak said. Recently, she’s even stopped socializing with the people from her old church and is avoiding making new Christian friends. “People I’ve known for years, I can’t even talk to them,” she said. “I keep thinking, ‘Were you always this angry and hateful?’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These trends, meanwhile, have reinforced a long-held feeling of embattlement among some Christians, particularly conservative ones. From the beginning of the Christian Right’s alliance with the Republican Party, the movement’s predominantly white leaders have presented themselves as the standard-bearers of a beleaguered cause. The country <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3flSfjLfYNEC&amp;dq=Evangelicals+and+Democracy+in+America%3A+Religion+and+Politics%2C+Volume+2&amp;q=secular+liberalism#v=snippet&amp;q=moral%20relativism&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was secularizing</a>; the feminist movement was <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pat-robertson-feminist-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaining ground</a>; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion was legal</a>; divorce rates <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/51/2/587/169435/Breaking-Up-Is-Hard-to-Count-The-Rise-of-Divorce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were high</a>; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/25660/chapter-abstract/193101621?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school prayer was outlawed</a>; <a href="https://religionandpolitics.org/2021/06/29/how-white-southern-christians-fought-to-preserve-segregation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial integration was mandated</a> for schools. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the years went on, this defensiveness was further entrenched by the election of the first Black president — who was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/09/14/a-startling-number-of-americans-still-believe-president-obama-is-a-muslim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falsely portrayed</a> as a Muslim by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-muslims/republicans-attack-obama-over-muslim-center-comments-idUSTRE67E0XC20100815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing media and politicians</a> — the legalization of same-sex marriage, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise/#:~:text=The%20growth%20in%20the%20number,older%20generations%20by%20newer%20ones." target="_blank" rel="noopener">dwindling church attendance</a>. The Christian Right’s battles increasingly revolved around <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-christian-right-has-a-new-strategy-on-gay-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the preservation of rights for Christians</a>, tacitly conceding their status as a cultural minority. Former president Donald Trump <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/trumps-age-old-christian-persecution-complex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capitalized on these feelings</a> of persecution politically and actually appears to have brought some of his nonreligious followers into the fold. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/15/more-white-americans-adopted-than-shed-evangelical-label-during-trump-presidency-especially-his-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pew Research Center study</a> released in 2021 found that some white respondents who had warm feelings about Trump but hadn’t previously identified as evangelical Christians began to embrace the label after Trump was elected. It was yet more evidence that Americans’ political perspectives are doing more and more work to <a href="https://www.rienner.com/uploads/5cbf8b764f751.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape their religious identities</a> — even if it’s not happening consciously.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, the beliefs and actions of a relatively small group of people may be calcifying this divide. A minority of Americans support views that could be described as Christian nationalist, an ideology <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/33661" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defined by social scientists</a> as the belief that the U.S. is a Christian nation, and should be returned to its Christian foundations — by force, if necessary. According to our survey, only 27 percent of respondents agreed that the “government should favor Christianity over other religions,” and even fewer (22 percent) said that “God has called on conservative Christians to take control of our politics and culture.” Only 13 percent said that “the federal government should advocate for Christian religious values,”<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options included “the federal government should advocate for moral values that are shared by people of many faiths,” “the federal government should not advocate for any specific set of moral values,” “neither/no opinion” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> and 19 percent said that “the federal government should stop enforcing separation of church and state.”<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options included “the federal government should enforce separation of church and state,” “neither/no opinion” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;

Doug Mastriano</a>, the Republican candidate for governor, who has presented his own extreme political views <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/a-pennsylvania-lawmaker-and-the-resurgence-of-christian-nationalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a battle against the forces of evil</a>. The fact that candidates like Mastriano aren’t relegated to the fringes makes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/opinion/jan-6-christian-nationalism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some Americans worry</a> that this small group is shaping the course of American politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Watson, who identifies as a political independent, told me that the Supreme Court’s decision to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn Roe v. Wade</a> this summer was a sign of how far conservative Christians were willing to go to enforce their ideology. “[Republicans] have appointed all these judges who are very strict about what a Christian worldview means,” she said. “There have always been people who were extremely pious who wanted the world to be their way, and I think those people have a lot of power right now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Talking to Democrats like Novak, there’s often a palpable feeling of bitterness toward conservative Christians and their role in shaping politics — and hostility toward religion itself. That can leave even some Democrats feeling nettled. I spoke with Becky Carrizales, 49, a Catholic Democrat who believes that other Democrats may be afraid to identify as Christian because the label is so associated with the Republican Party. “I have lots of friends on Twitter and if I post anything religious, you know, I’ll get attacked by fellow Democrats,” she said. “They’ll say, ‘Why are you a Catholic? [Catholics] are going against everything we believe in.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But on the right, that hostility mostly reinforces the idea that liberals really are trying to stifle traditional Christian values — making Christians the real victims. One survey respondent, Scott Barum, 54, identifies as a Christian but doesn’t attend church or belong to a denomination. He said from his perspective, it’s secular values — like gay rights — that are being forced on the country. “The whole LGBTQ agenda, transgenderism — don’t force-feed it to Americans who aren’t going to change their minds,” Barum said. “I believe the country wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in if we had conservative Christians in power.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a cyclical feeling to these conversations — a sense of one view reinforcing another, which reinforces another, which reinforces another — that has created an almost impenetrable barrier between the two sides. There are people, like Carrizales, who are managing to balance religious and political identities that feel increasingly at odds. But competing perceptions of Christianity’s power seem unlikely to change — if anything, they may deepen further. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Novak told me that she wants moderate Americans to have more of a voice. She wishes that everyone was less angry. But when I asked her whether she thinks about reconnecting with Christians she’s estranged from, she sighed and said no. “I think sometimes about the time when Americans could agree, when there was a middle ground,” she said. “But it’s so hard to even imagine. Now I mostly sit and go, ‘Did we ever really do that?’”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Can we trust election polls?” is a question that has reached a fever pitch in political junkie circles dating back to the 2016 election. One popular theory about why election polls missed in 2016 and 2020 is that Trump-friendly voters <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-supporters-arent-shy-but-polls-could-still-be-missing-some-of-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to respond to surveys</a>, making Trump’s support among the population appear lower than it actually was. People give many anecdotal reasons for why this happened, but the big takeaway from this theory is that election surveys are undercounting Republicans and Trump voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, many proponents of this theory lack data when making this assertion. The <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a>, conducted using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, can shed some light on whether this is happening in 2022. Back in April, we launched a panel study with a group of about 2,000 Americans whose demographic makeup was representative of the U.S. The goal of the project was to see how their fears and beliefs changed in the six months leading up to the midterm elections. However, we’ve found this project has additional, unintended value. Following that initial survey, there was a large drop-off in participation in the second wave and a smaller drop-off between the second and third wave, after which participation largely plateaued. In total, there was a 23 percent decline in the number of participants between the first wave and the sixth and most recent wave (the results of this wave are forthcoming).<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also saw &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2018/10/09/the-rbs-poll-comports-well-with-data-from-the-full-voter-file-about-the-partisanship-of-registered-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;typical declines in the shares of responses&lt;/a&gt; by age and race, among other demographic groupings, such that younger, Black and Hispanic respondents participated at lower rates relative to other age groups and races and ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>23</sup></a> This allows us, in a limited way, to examine something called “nonresponse bias” — that is, who is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/24/opinion/frustrated-with-polling-pollsters-are-too.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>not</em> answering surveys</a> — and how it impacts polling data.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our data indicates that some respondents who lean toward the Republican Party are less likely to take part in follow-up surveys. But we didn’t find ourselves in a situation where <em>all</em> Republicans were not answering, and we were able to find a few clues as to who exactly these Republican non-respondents could be.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The charts below show the share of various types of respondents from our initial survey who then took part in subsequent waves.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares calculated for this analysis are not weighted. We’re focusing on unweighted data here to examine the raw number of people participating in surveys, their demographic breakdown and how that changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> By looking at each individual wave, we can get a sense of response rates for the different demographic groups we’ve surveyed: </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Republicans were more likely to stop responding to our survey" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iU68a/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="600" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">People who said they voted for Trump in 2020 and that they plan to vote for Republicans in the midterms this year have very high response rates relative to the overall sample. (It’s worth noting, however, that recalled vote choice is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2110693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a perfect measure</a>. We’re using it here as a proxy for partisanship and political engagement.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Likely nonvoters were most likely to ghost us" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1ECKd/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="600" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, for most of the time series, we see a dramatic drop-off in response rates among 2020 Trump voters who say they are <em>not</em> likely to vote for Republicans this year or people who say they view Trump “very” favorably (as opposed to “somewhat” favorably). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Trump's biggest supporters didn't stick around with our polling" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7sgzq/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="600" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, people who said they get most of their news from Fox News were also more likely than the average respondent to continue in the survey. And Americans who primarily get their news from social media or who do not consume political news at all were also among the most likely to drop out.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked what their main source of news is. “Mainstream” sources include the answer choices “ABC / CBS / NBC News,” “The New York Times, Washington Post or Wall Street Journal,” “Telemundo,” “Univision,” “public television or radio” or “your local newspaper.” “Social” includes “YouTube” or “social media.” “Online” refers to “digital or online news.” Other options included “FOX News,” “MSNBC,” “CNN,” “Other” or “None of these” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Fox News viewers were likely to stick around in our survey" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eSCMn/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="650" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taken together, we have a picture of a specific slice of the Republican electorate that might not be responding to surveys: the Trump-supporting, social media news consumer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite these differences in response rates, there is another factor we must take into account about how election surveys are conducted: “weighting” to match the demographics of the electorate. Since the 2020 election, weighting to vote choice or other political characteristics has become much more widespread. Our FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey weights for participation and vote preference in the 2020 election. These political weights can go a long way in repairing any gaps in the sample. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One way to visualize the partisan impact of the sample is with the generic congressional ballot, which asks respondents if they plan to support an unnamed Democrat or Republican in an upcoming election. When we look at how respondents answered to the generic ballot in the first wave with our <em>unweighted</em> data, we can see clearly how the people who participated in our first wave and our most recent wave skewed Republican (33 percent) and independent (36 percent). The remaining sample in our most recent wave continues to show a slight skew towards Republicans, with 32 percent choosing the Democrat compared to 34 percent the Republican, suggesting the share of the sample planning to vote Democratic has increased. Meanwhile, independents were the largest group that failed to respond to the latest wave. If we left the data unweighted, we could possibly be overreporting the potential performance of Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, when we adjust the data with weighting that incorporates 2020 vote preferences, we see there is no such skew. If anything, our latest wave leans slightly more Republican than it was before we weighted it. This suggests that weighting for vote preference can slightly <em>overcorrect</em> for missing Republican or Trump-leaning voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Weighting results helps correct imbalances in response rates" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZJ5q4/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, this analysis is based on a single series of surveys that revisits the same people. And while we try to account for some margin of error in our polling, there is likely still some level of nonresponse bias in our initial pool of respondents that goes beyond what we can measure in this analytic exercise. However, these nonresponse patterns are indicative of the groups that are challenging for most survey research to reach and, as a result, may help reveal the types of people missing in contemporary public polling. At the same time, it’s also clear that much of that skew can be accounted for by using appropriate weighting techniques to bring estimates back in line with benchmark information about the population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Returning to whether nonresponse bias causes pollsters to underestimate Republican support, we are left with a definite “it depends.” On one hand, our research provides some evidence that particular Trump-leaning voters are less likely to participate in surveys over time. If this is true more widely, the polls could be understating GOP support. However, we also show that there are certainly Republicans in these election polls and survey weighting can correct for this handful of missing respondents. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In September, <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/west-virginia-gov-justice-signs-abortion-ban-into-law/article_5bade5ae-35de-11ed-afc5-ebffc22475a7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Virginia</a> passed a law effectively banning abortion. In July, <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/07/22/newsom-signs-first-in-nation-bill-allowing-residents-to-sue-makers-sellers-of-illegal-assault-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> enacted a law allowing citizens to sue gun merchants for making or selling illegal firearms. In 2021, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-georgias-new-voting-law-is-such-a-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-have-made-it-harder-to-vote-in-11-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas</a> were among the states to tighten their voting laws in response to false claims of voter fraud. The same year, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/2/22/22295393/illinois-governor-jb-pritzker-criminal-justice-reform-bill-cash-bail-police-bodycams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois</a> became the first state to eliminate cash bail.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These momentous policy changes were only possible because the same party controlled the state Senate, state House and governorship. When one party enjoys a state-government “trifecta” or has enough of a legislative majority to override vetoes by a governor of the opposite party, it can enact virtually any legislation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Currently, 44 percent of the population<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> resides in one of the 25 states where Republicans control state government, and 38 percent live in one of the 16 states controlled by Democrats. But that could change after the midterms when <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_legislative_elections,_2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">88 state-legislative chambers</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36 governorships</a> are on the ballot.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">While <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-redistricting-affects-the-battle-for-state-legislatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of competitive state legislatures</a> shrank to a handful as a result of redistricting, there are still 10 states where one party could seize full control of state government this year. And there are eight states where one party may lose complete control. So here are the races on the ballot this November that will decide the future of policymaking in those states.</p>



<h2><strong>Where either party could take full control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Six states could end 2022 under total Democratic control, Republican control <em>or</em> divided government. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with three states where Democrats currently control the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature, but could potentially lose all three. In <strong>Nevada</strong>, the governor’s race is a toss-up, according to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All forecast odds are as of 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, Oct. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> And although Democratic mapmakers tried to make the chamber more solidly Democratic in redistricting, the state Assembly is rated “Lean Democratic” by <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/nevada#lower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNalysis</a>, a state-legislative forecasting website. Republicans could also flip the state Senate, though that will likely be a taller order. There are only <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/nevada#upper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three competitive seats</a> this cycle, and Republicans need to win all three to take control, including one with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a> of D+7.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maine</strong> is another Democratic-controlled state that could become completely red. Despite being slightly more Democratic-leaning than the country as a whole, Maine has a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maine/articles/2021-09-29/maine-lawmakers-to-have-final-say-on-redistricting-proposal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan redistricting process</a> that yielded a state House map with a median seat that leans <em>Republican</em> (R+2). The new state Senate map, with a median seat of D+2, is also competitive and has attracted <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2022/10/16/top-battlegrounds-in-battle-for-maine-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more campaign spending</a> than the House. That said, Democrats have reason to be optimistic. Through the first week of October, they had spent <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2022/10/16/democrats-allies-are-spending-big-in-bid-to-keep-control-of-maines-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four times more</a> on state-legislative races than Republicans, and Republicans have only an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/maine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside shot</a> at picking up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blaine_House" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s mansion</a>. Still, if even one chamber flips, Republicans will have deprived Democrats of total control.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Oregon</strong> has emerged as a problem spot for Democrats, partly because of outgoing Democratic Gov. Kate Brown’s <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/05/new-poll-finds-kate-brown-is-nations-least-popular-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopularity</a>. The race to replace her is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tight</a>, and Democratic control of the legislature is also threatened. The Republican State Leadership Committee named Oregon <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/briefs/national-republicans-list-oregon-as-top-target-for-flipping-legislative-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of its top targets</a>, and local billionaire Phil Knight has invested <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/09/29/nike-co-founder-phil-knight-spends-big-oregon-legislature-republican-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least $2 million</a> in electing Republican legislators. Local experts consider the state Senate more flippable than the state House and have <a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/19/oregon-2022-midterm-election-republican-democrat-house-senate-seats-races/66120125007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified around six competitive seats</a>. However, the House’s median seat is less blue than the Senate’s, and <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/oregon#lower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNalysis</a> thinks the House could change hands too. A tie is a real possibility too, since each chamber in Oregon has an even number of seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three other currently divided states could conceivably fall under total Democratic or Republican control. After years of <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/maps-show-how-gerrymandering-benefitted-michigan-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gerrymandering-fueled</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTxxrLQlnrEl9ocgwUM7EL4PasH-5lmyf7sttn2GSMg/edit#gid=235559234" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican dominance</a>, <strong>Michigan</strong> finally has fair state-legislative maps this year thanks to the state’s new <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/new-districts-give-democrats-chance-flip-michigan-legislature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent redistricting commission</a>. As a result, Democrats have a real chance to win the state House for the first time since 2011 and the state Senate for the first time since 1984. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/AdImpact_Pol/status/1575167120425783297?s=20&amp;t=bXCwnS0YIxH6_xvXbQZ8dA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdImpact</a>, $23 million had been spent on Michigan state-legislative races as of late September — more than any other state — and $18 million was from Democrats. With Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely to win reelection</a>, a Democratic trifecta seems within reach. However, Republicans remain <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/michigan#upper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive</a> in the <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/michigan#lower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislature</a>, and the GOP could gain complete control if the party can upset Whitmer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting made the <strong>Pennsylvania</strong> state House more competitive, too; the new median seat has a partisan lean of R+4, just 1 point redder than the state as a whole. Democrats are <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-democrats-control-of-state-house-20220825.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting 14 districts</a>, mainly in the suburbs, that President Biden would have carried in 2020. They need to flip 12 to end the majority Republicans have enjoyed since 2011. However, it would probably take a Democratic or Republican landslide to make Pennsylvania a one-party-rule state. That’s because Republicans are <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/pennsylvania#upper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly favored</a> to maintain their 28-year majority in the state Senate. Democrats would need to win every seat on the ballot with an R+6 partisan lean or bluer to tie the chamber (in which case the lieutenant governor would break ties). Conversely, it will be hard for Republicans to fully control the state because Democrats have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid lead</a> in the governor’s race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, in <strong>Minnesota</strong>, the local Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party currently controls the governorship and the state House, while Republicans hold the state Senate. All three could change hands this November, though the DFL is likelier than Republicans to take full control. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comfortably favored</a> to win reelection. But the legislature is a <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/minnesota/its-a-toss-up-whether-gop-or-dfl-will-control-in-minnesota-legislature-but-handful-of-districts-will-be-key" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toss-up</a>. There are as many as <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/09/14/minnesota-house-senate-election-outlook-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 competitive districts in the Senate</a> (the DFL needs to flip only three to take control) and 27 in the House (Republicans need only four).</p>



<h2><strong>Where Republicans could take full control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then there are three states currently under a divided government that Republicans could win all for themselves, but Democrats realistically can’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alaska</strong> would already be under total GOP control if moderate Republican and independent representatives didn’t form a coalition with Democrats to govern the state House. But with redistricting and retirements likely to result in <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2022/05/26/departing-incumbents-and-new-districts-set-stage-for-high-turnover-in-alaska-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of turnover in Juneau</a>, mainline Republicans are hoping to take back control. According to the <a href="https://alaskalandmine.com/landmines/three-key-anchorage-races-will-determine-if-republicans-take-control-of-state-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska Landmine</a>, non-coalition Republicans are safe bets to win 19 out of the House’s 40 seats. Three more seats are competitive, and two more will likely elect Republicans who may or may not join the coalition. But some observers think the new maps and ranked-choice voting system could result in <em>more </em>legislators joining the coalition in the House — and maybe even forming one in the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>North Carolina</strong>, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s term runs through 2024. But Democrats don’t have a <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/uphill-battle-for-gop-supermajority-in-the-n-c-general-assembly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">realistic path to a legislative majority</a>. So Republicans could still have free rein to legislate if they pick up two seats in the state Senate and three in the state House. That would give the GOP a three-fifths majority in each chamber — enough to override Cooper’s vetoes. Cooper has issued a <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/verify/yes-gov-cooper-has-vetoed-more-bills-than-any-other-governor-in-north-carolina/275-15ef835a-452a-4f20-bc2c-69fa4d9ddffa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic number</a> of vetoes to kill bills related to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/roy-cooper-north-carolina-2022-midterm-election-abortion/671770/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting, COVID-19, guns</a>, <a href="https://www.wral.com/cooper-vetoes-critical-race-theory-rioting-bills/19868716/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests and critical race theory</a>. If Republicans win a supermajority, their leaders have said they would like to <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/article265886936.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revisit some of those bills</a> and pass <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/abortion-access-in-north-carolina-might-hinge-on-5-seats-in-the-state-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more restrictions on abortion</a>. <a href="https://www.johnlocke.org/will-republicans-win-supermajorities-in-the-north-carolina-general-assembly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In-state experts</a> have <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/2022-elections/2022/10/19/can-the-gop-get-a-supermajority-in-the-n-c--legislature--it-comes-down-to-a-handful-of-seats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified</a> eight to nine competitive districts in the state Senate and 19 to 20 in the state House. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Wisconsin</strong>’s new state-legislative maps are also safely Republican, so control of Wisconsin state government will likely come down to the governor’s race. According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is ever so slightly favored over Republican businessman Tim Michels. But Republicans could also take control by securing veto-proof majorities in the legislature (in this case, two-thirds of each chamber). That looks <a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/panelists-say-gop-has-good-shot-at-supermajority-in-senate-tougher-path-in-assembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doable</a> in the state Senate, where Republicans need only one more seat, but it’s <a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/republicans-look-for-veto-proof-wisconsin-legislature-majorities-in-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more uncertain</a> in the state Assembly, where they’ll need to flip five. Like Cooper, Evers has vetoed a <a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/wisconsin-republicans-veto-proof-supermajority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic number of bills</a> — 126 during the last legislative session — on topics like <a href="https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2022/10/could-republicans-win-a-legislative-supermajority-in-wisconsin?ct=content_open&amp;cv=cbox_latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election administration, education funding and guns</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Where Democrats could take full control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is one state where Democrats can take complete control but Republicans can’t: <strong>Vermont</strong>. Republican Gov. Phil Scott is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but certain</a> to get reelected, and Democrats’ state-legislative majorities are more than secure. However, there is a chance that Democrats could achieve the two-thirds majorities needed to <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/10/12/stowes-house-seat-has-long-been-a-democratic-white-whale-can-they-finally-flip-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">override Scott’s vetoes</a> without any third-party support. (There are currently a handful of state representatives not aligned with either major party.) Democrats already have <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/people/all/2022/Senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 out of 30 seats</a> in the state Senate and need to pick up <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/people/all/2022/House" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just two seats</a> in the state House to hit two-thirds. However, Republicans also hope they can gain <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/06/05/the-paperwork-is-in-here-are-most-of-the-legislative-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five House seats</a> to sustain Scott’s vetoes without third-party support. (They have a chance to whittle the Democratic supermajority <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/10/12/sen-mark-macdonald-hospitalized-after-experiencing-mild-stroke-family-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the state Senate</a> as well.)</p>



<h2><strong>Where Republicans could break Democratic control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two states currently controlled by one party could be reduced to a divided government this election cycle. In <strong>New Mexico</strong>, Republicans have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 1-in-8 chance</a> to defeat Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. Still, they can’t take complete control because the Democratic-held state Senate isn’t up for election until 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democrats are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe bets</a> to hold onto the <strong>Colorado</strong> governor’s office. But the state legislature is in play thanks to an independent redistricting commission that appears to have gone out of its way to draw competitive seats. On paper, the state House is a tough but doable flip for Republicans; its median seat has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+6. However, Democrats currently have a <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/legislators?field_chamber_target_id=1&amp;field_political_affiliation_target_id=All&amp;sort_bef_combine=field_last_name_value%20ASC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17-seat majority</a>, so in-state observers <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/09/13/colorado-elections-2022-republicans-state-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consider the state Senate a more realistic target</a>. Out of the <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/10/07/7-colorado-senate-seats-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven Senate districts</a> that are competitive, Republicans will have to win six to take control. Some individual districts have seen as much as <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/10/08/colorado-house-senate-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 million in campaign spending</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Where Democrats could break Republican control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans have enjoyed full control of <strong>Arizona</strong> state government since 2009, but their time may soon end. The governor’s race leans <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly toward the Republicans</a>, and the GOP has just a two-seat majority in both the state Senate and the state House. However, redistricting made the Arizona state-legislative map <a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/arizonas-new-legislative-map-appears-to-give-republicans-an-edge/article_df92dfc8-6375-11ec-a36a-ef00daf8da0c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friendlier to the GOP</a>, so it will be hard for Democrats to win outright majorities. The Senate and House use the same map, with each district electing one senator and two representatives. In the state House, Democrats have <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/07/arizona-legislature-key-races-watch-november-democrats-republicans/10382960002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopted the controversial strategy</a> of running just one candidate each in four key districts, ceding their shot at a majority to increase the odds of a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/incaseofatie.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tied chamber</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>New Hampshire</strong>, Republicans took complete control of state government after the 2020 elections, and Democrats are eager to flip them back. The 400-member state House is prone to wild swings from election to election: It went from a 225-175 Republican majority <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_2017_March_1_9%20am.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after 2016</a> to a 234-166 Democratic majority <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_2019_February%201st.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after 2018</a> to a 213-187 Republican majority <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/elections/Legis_Control_2-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after 2020</a>.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a large legislature in such a small state means that only a few votes are cast for each seat, making it easier for just a handful of swing voters to change an election result. In addition, some New Hampshire state House districts are represented by multiple representatives, so when one district swings, it can affect several seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is also <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/newly-united-democrats-aim-to-flip-these-key-state-seats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting the state Senate</a>, but that will be <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2022-10-24/nh-state-senate-redistricting-gerrymandering-elections-voting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more difficult</a>. Democrats would have to win at least one district that former President Donald Trump carried in 2020 to gain a majority. Even if they manage that, they almost certainly won’t take complete control since Republican Gov. Chris Sununu is a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid bet</a> to win reelection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite <strong>Kansas</strong> having a Democratic governor, Republicans currently have full control of the Sunflower State because they have veto-proof majorities in the state legislature. However, Democrats need to flip only three Republican-held state House seats to break that supermajority. (The state Senate is not up for election this year.) <a href="https://t.co/yB25BVCeD8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are targeting districts</a> Biden carried in 2020 in cities like Manhattan and Emporia and, especially, the Kansas City suburbs. But if they want to sustain Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s vetoes, they will also need Kelly to win reelection; she currently has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-in-5 chance</a> of doing so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, there are three red states with safely Republican legislatures but where Democrats have an outside shot at breaking up a GOP monopoly by winning the governor’s office. The most realistic of these is <strong>Georgia</strong>, where Democratic former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1-in-10 chance of victory</a>. Democrats have only about a 1-in-20 chance of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipping</a> the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governorships</a> of <strong>Florid</strong><strong>a</strong> or <strong>Texas</strong>. And in Florida, Republicans have a <a href="https://mcimaps.com/the-2022-florida-state-senate-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">path to a supermajority</a> in the state legislature, allowing them to override a Democratic governor’s vetoes.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, the most likely outcome of the 2022 election in Washington, D.C., is a split government, with Republicans controlling at least one chamber of Congress but Democrats still holding the White House. That could very well mean that the only policymaking of note for the next two years will take place on the state level. They may not get the same amount of attention, but these races for state legislature and governor are arguably more important ones on the ballot this year.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">For political candidates from underrepresented groups, progress can be uneven — and the 2022 midterms could be a great example of that, at least when it comes to women candidates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, it looks like we’re heading for a record-setting year for women in governors’ races. According to our forecast, there are 12 female gubernatorial candidates who have at least a 50-in-100 chance of winning in FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, as of Tuesday at 12 p.m. Eastern. If each were to win their election, it would be historic. Up until now, <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/levels-office/statewide-elective-executive/history-women-governors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only nine women have simultaneously occupied</a> governors’ mansions. And two of the most competitive governors’ races — in Oregon and Arizona — have only women as major candidates, which increases the odds that the record will be broken this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the outlook isn’t so good for women running for Congress. Several of the most vulnerable congressional candidates are women, including many Democratic House candidates who flipped seats in 2018. And it’s quite possible that the number of women in Congress will decline after the November elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So why do women candidates’ fortunes seem to be on the wane in some cases and not others? <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-women-candidates-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we pointed out earlier this month</a>, fewer women are running for Congress than in previous years — and the success of the previous two cycles may have made leaders in both parties feel like there’s less of a need to focus on getting more women elected. “When you talk about the pink wave or the ‘Year of the Woman,’ it makes people think that things are done, that women have taken over,” said <a href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/kelly-dittmar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly Dittmar</a>, an associate professor of political science at Rutgers University and the director of research at the Center for Women and Politics, “when in reality they’re still less than 30 percent of the U.S. Congress.”</p>



<h2><strong>Women could make history in gubernatorial races</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Women are underrepresented at every level of government, but it’s proven particularly hard for female candidates to win governorships. In the country’s history, only 45 women have served as governors, and there are <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/levels-office/statewide-elective-executive/history-women-governors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 states that have never had a female governor</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those numbers seem very likely to change this year. There are 25 women affiliated with a major party running for governor, and 12 of them have a 50-in-100 or greater chance of winning their race, according to our Deluxe forecast as of Tuesday at 12 p.m. Eastern. (All data in this story is as of that same date and time.) Of course, their odds vary a lot. But as the table below shows, nine women are at least likely to win their races — which means they have a minimum of a 75-in-100 chance of winning. Two of those candidates could set records for their state: Democrats Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Kathy Hochul of New York, both of whom would become the first woman <em>elected</em> as governor of their states.<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, then-Lt.

Jane Swift of Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/11/us/in-a-first-woman-takes-over-governorship-of-massachusetts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;took over&lt;/a&gt; after then-Gov. Paul Cellucci resigned, making her the first woman to serve as governor of the state. In 2021, then-Lt. Gov. Hochul replaced Andrew Cuomo &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/08/nyregion/cuomo-kathy-hochul.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;after he resigned as governor&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first woman to serve as governor of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">The other three races are tighter, but regardless of what happens, they’ll result in at least two new female governors. That’s because women are running against each other in two of those close races. Right now, Republican Christine Drazan has a 51-in-100 chance of winning against Democrat Tina Kotek in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oregon governor’s race</a>, and Republican Kari Lake has a 58-in-100 chance of winning against Democrat Katie Hobbs in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona governor’s race</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These gains are significant because even as the number of women <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/15/a-record-number-of-women-are-serving-in-the-117th-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Congress</a> and <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/the-rise-of-women-in-state-legislatures-a-state-by-state-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state legislatures</a> has steadily increased, the number in governors’ seats has remained low. That’s partially because there simply aren’t a lot of those seats to fill, but it’s also because voters’ prejudice against female candidates are particularly strong when women run for executive-level offices, like governor or president. Several decades of social science research has found that voters are <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Anzia_Bernhard_WomeninLocalElections_3_29_19.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more comfortable</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-13540-003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electing women</a> when they run to be part of a group — like a state legislature or Congress — <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2901548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather than a position</a> of high-level leadership, although some evidence shows that Democratic-leaning voters have become more open to the idea. Voters are especially likely to associate such roles <a href="https://ww3.aauw.org/research/barriers-and-bias/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with stereotypically masculine behaviors</a> like aggression and initiative, which may cloud how they see women who run for those offices. And then there’s the fact that the decision to run for office can <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/440330#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involve more considerations</a> for women than it does for men, such as balancing their priorities at home, and many women may <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/upshot/the-problem-for-women-is-not-winning-its-deciding-to-run.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose not to throw their hat into the ring</a> for prestigious offices like governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few reasons why this might be changing. Dittmar pointed out that <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/05/07/record-women-governor-2018-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high numbers of women ran for governor in 2018</a> as well — so in that sense, the trend is just continuing this year. And as more women get elected to lower-level offices, the bench of potential nominees with electoral experience is growing. For example, Hobbs currently <a href="https://azsos.gov/about-office/about-secretary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serves as the Arizona secretary of state</a> — a role that left her well-positioned to run for governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More women running for governor — and winning — is a noteworthy change in the status quo. But it’s not a full transformation, particularly because the pool of women likely to win gubernatorial races is overwhelmingly white.<a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on candidate race and ethnicity was collected by political scientists Bernard Fraga and Hunter Rendleman. They relied on statements made by candidates, membership in racial and ethnic caucuses or organizations, racial and ethnic advocacy organizations, news articles and candidate websites. This research is, by nature, not comprehensive — for example, Fraga and Rendleman were unable to confirm some candidates’ racial identities — but the data is close enough to identify important trends. It is also worth noting that some candidates belong to multiple races or ethnicities. And the numbers in this story exclude candidates for whom race/ethnicity are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a> Among the 25 women running, only four are candidates of color — and three of them have very low odds of winning. So it’s likely that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michelle Lujan Grisham</a>, the incumbent governor of New Mexico, will be the only woman of color elected governor this year.</p>



<h2><strong>The outlook isn’t as good for women in Congress</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even though research shows that Americans are more comfortable with women serving in legislative roles, this year is not shaping up well for female congressional candidates. That’s particularly striking given how much progress women have made in recent years. In the 2018 midterm election, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/6/18119733/congress-diversity-women-election-good-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a record number of women were elected</a> to Congress, and following the 2020 election, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-record-number-of-republican-women-will-and-wont-change-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a record number of women were seated</a> in Congress, boosted by a record number of Republican women.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, it’s possible the number of women in Congress will hold steady — but it’s more likely that women’s representation will <em>decrease</em>. According to FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, there are 124 women running for House seats and six women running for Senate who have a 50-in-100 or greater chance of winning their race. If a woman won in all those races,<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two races that feature two women candidates who each currently have a 50-in-100 chance of winning: Kansas’s 3rd District, with Republican Amanda Adkins and Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids; and the Alaska Senate race, with Kelly Tshibaka and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, both of whom are Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>32</sup></a> there would still be 147 women in Congress, including the 19 female senators who are not up for reelection — the same number as now. But as the table below shows, a lot of those House candidates are in very close races.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Several vulnerable candidates are Democratic women who flipped seats in the 2018 election and are now facing strong challengers in a year when the environment is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable for Republicans</a>. Some of those women — like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/virginia/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia’s Rep. Elaine Luria</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s Rep. Susan Wild</a> — are running against other women, so even if they lose, another woman will take their place. But others, like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/iowa/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa Rep. Cindy Axne</a>, are running against men. And some Republican women are vulnerable too. For instance, Rep. Yvette Herrell of New Mexico <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-new-mexico-house-district-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipped her House seat in 2020</a> but is only <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-mexico/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly favored to win</a> against Democrat Gabriel Vasquez this fall.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s far from guaranteed that women will increase their numbers in Congress. If we narrow our criteria and look only at the women candidates who are likely to win their races — that is, the candidates with a 75-in-100 or greater chance of winning, according to the Deluxe forecast — the number of women in Congress shrinks to 135.<a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, counting the 19 female senators who are not up for reelection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>33</sup></a> That would mean a substantial <em>reduction</em> in the number of women serving. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the reason for this situation is that a lot of women in both parties are running for seats where they have basically no chance of winning. According to the Deluxe forecast, 48 percent of all female House candidates and 30 percent of all female Senate candidates are running in seats where they have 50-in-100 or greater chance of winning.<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes Kansas’s 3rd District and the Alaska Senate race, which each feature two women candidates with 50-in-100 chance of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> But 8 percent of female House candidates are running in seats where their chance of winning is between 10-in-100 and 49-in-100, and a whopping 44 percent of female House candidates and 60 percent of female Senate candidates are running in races where their chances of winning are 9-in-100 or less.<a data-footnote-id="35" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-35" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting, though, that this includes races such as the Alaska Senate race, where Democrat Patricia Chesbro, whose chance of winning is less than 1-in-100, is running against two other women, Kelly Tshibaka and Sen. Lisa Murkowski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>35</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are some party differences here. Democrats did a better job than Republicans of nominating women to run in competitive House races: Half of Democratic women running for House seats have a 50-in-100 or greater chance of winning, compared with 44 percent of Republican women. And a slightly greater share of Democratic women than Republican women are running in noncompetitive Senate races: More than half (62 percent) of Democratic women candidates for Senate are running in races where they have a 9-in-100 or less chance of winning, compared with 57 percent of Republican women candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The number of women of color in Congress could increase, though, depending on how some toss-up races turn out. Fifty-three female House candidates of color are running in races where they have at least a 50-in-100 chance of winning. An additional senator — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tammy Duckworth of Illinois</a> — falls into that same range of chance. So if all of those candidates win, the number of women of color in Congress would increase <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/women-color-elective-office-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from 49</a> to 54 — although, of course, not all of these candidates are guaranteed to win.<a data-footnote-id="36" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-36" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counting Sen. Mazie Hirono, who is Asian and is not up for reelection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>36</sup></a></p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Whatever happens, we’re clearly not heading for another banner year for women in Congress. Dittmar said that could be for a lot of reasons, including that several now-incumbent <a href="https://www.axios.com/2018/11/29/2018-midterm-elections-house-democrats-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women won competitive races in 2018</a> (and held on in 2020), which leaves more women to defend their seats this year. Democrats may also have been more reluctant to run in what would historically be considered a Republican year, she said, and this may have had a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to run as Democrats. And all of the focus on women’s victories in 2018 and 2020 may have created a false sense of parity, leading party leadership to focus less on elevating female candidates, she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Dittmar also cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from a single year. She pointed out that women’s successes in 2018 are visible in some of this year’s candidates — like Summer Lee, a progressive Democrat who is clearly favored to win the race for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 12th District</a>. Lee was elected to the Pennsylvania state Legislature in 2018 and won the nomination in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressives-democrats-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a competitive Democratic primary</a> earlier this year. Now, she’s poised to become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/us/politics/summer-lee-house-pa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Black congresswoman from Pennsylvania</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There are lots of different kinds of success stories for women — we shouldn’t just look at the topline numbers,” Dittmar said. “You look at young women of color who got out there and ran for office and, four years later, will be in Congress. We have to pay attention to those stories too.”</p>]]></description>

		</div>





<p data-paragraph="main">In May, Anna Paulina Luna <a href="https://twitter.com/realannapaulina/status/1522383949791739905?s=20&amp;t=kVbLNHHOFL9pdC-m1nzRlA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donned a red-carpet-worthy ball gown</a> to a screening of “2000 Mules,” a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/07/texas-ken-paxton-2000-mules-sid-miller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debunked documentary</a> that falsely claims to show evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. In June, she made her stance on the 2020 election clear <a href="https://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20220602_020000_Field_Report_With_Paola_Ramos/start/120/end/180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with MSNBC</a>: “I believe that President Trump won that election, and I do believe that voter fraud occurred.” And in November, she will very likely be elected to Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Luna is the Republican candidate for Florida’s 13th District, on the Gulf Coast around St. Petersburg. During redistricting last year, Republicans redrew <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this previously competitive district to be much redder</a>, and as a result, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/florida/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luna has a 97-in-100 shot</a> at beating her Democrat opponent, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, as of Monday at 12 p.m. Eastern. (All numbers in this story are as of that same time and date.)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1312" height="1103" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.51.37-PM-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.51.37-PM-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.51.37-PM-1.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.51.37-PM-1.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Luna is one of well over a hundred of candidates running this fall who have denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are candidates who either clearly stated that the election was stolen from Trump, or took legal action to overturn the results, such as voting not to certify election results or joining lawsuits that sought to overturn the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> and have a strong chance of winning their race. Of the 185 Republican candidates running for House, Senate and governor’s seats who have denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, 124 — or 67 percent — are in races our forecast currently pins at “Solid R,” meaning they have a 95-in-100 or better chance of winning. Overall, a bigger share of election deniers are running in Solid R races than Republican candidates in general: Of the 496 Republican candidates running for House, Senate and governor, 225 — or 45 percent — are in Solid R races.<a data-footnote-id="35" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-35" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We considered the viable candidates (i.e., those with at least a 10 percent chance of winning) for races in which more than one Republican was running for office in the general election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>35</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Election-denying candidates running to become House representatives are faring better than those running to be governor or Senator. There are 170 election deniers running for House seats, and 70 percent (119) are running in Solid R races. Among the seven running for governor, only two — Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and Idaho Gov. Brad Little — are running in Solid R races. And of the eight election deniers running for Senate, just three — Katie Britt in Alabama, Eric Schmitt in Missouri and Markwayne Mullin in Oklahoma’s special election — have better than 95-in-100 odds.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Most election deniers are likely to win their races" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XeZxM/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="240" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">A sizable portion of election-denying candidates are also running in races where they’re very <em>unlikely</em> to win. Thirty-six election-denying candidates, or 19 percent, are running in races that our forecast currently identifies as Solid D, giving them a 5-in-100 or worse shot at winning. This includes candidates such as Jeff Zink, the GOP candidate for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona’s 3rd Congressional District</a>. Zink has not only claimed the 2020 election was stolen; he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/23/us/jan-6-attendees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also participated in the Jan. 6 rally</a> that preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol, though he says he never entered the building. FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast gives Zink a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/arizona/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 1-in-100 chance</a> of winning.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, very few election deniers are running in toss-up races. Toss-up races are rarer in general — particularly as partisan redistricting <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-competitive-districts-near-extinction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creates fewer competitive districts</a> — but there are disproportionately fewer election deniers facing these kinds of odds than Republican candidates overall. Just four election-denying candidates (2 percent of all deniers) are running in races that are currently deemed toss-ups by our Deluxe forecast: Kari Lake, who’s running for governor in Arizona; Monica De La Cruz and Mike Garcia, who are running for House seats in Texas and California, respectively; and Senate candidate Adam Laxalt in Nevada. Comparatively, there are 17 Republicans running in toss-up races overall, or 3 percent of candidates. This might be due to Republican voters in competitive districts rejecting more extreme candidates in the primary in favor of a stronger general-election candidate, while voters in solid Democratic or Republican areas could afford to select more extreme candidates since it would have less impact in the general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Republican candidates who have accepted the legitimacy of the 2020 election are less likely than election deniers to be in Solid R races. Of the 67 Republican candidates who accept the 2020 election, 30 — or 45 percent — are running in races where they have 95-in-100 or better odds. This includes candidates such as North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, who is running for reelection and is <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1171/vote_117_1_00002.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the Republicans who voted to certify</a> the 2020 election results. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s still two weeks left before the election, and the forecast is updating constantly, so none of these results is set in stone. However, this snapshot shows that claiming the 2020 election was stolen doesn’t seem to preclude GOP candidates from winning elections this fall. </p>]]></description>

Polling is dead.” We heard variations on <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/polling-catastrophe/616986/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this theme</a> after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat larger-than-average polling errors</a> in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. The reality, though, is that polls are still quite important <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-polling-on-the-issues-probably-isnt-as-broken-as-horse-race-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to understanding what the public thinks about different issues</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2330443X.2021.1971126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remain useful for forecasting elections</a>, as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast</a> is doing this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, the death of polling has been greatly exaggerated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t mean, however, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/24/opinion/frustrated-with-polling-pollsters-are-too.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there aren’t reasons to be worried</a> about the state of polling in 2022. One big concern is that we have fewer surveys of individual contests in 2022 than in previous midterms. And a larger share of that smaller pie has been conducted by partisan pollsters and/or sponsored by partisan organizations, based on an analysis of polls conducted from early May to late October in the 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022 midterm election cycles.<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aggregated poll and poll sponsorship data across all races for the U.S. Senate, U.S. House (including the generic ballot) and governor in FiveThirtyEight’s database. We removed polls from the same pollster and sponsor(s) with overlapping dates to prevent overweighting them in the analysis. An individual survey by one pollster that asked questions about multiple races we’re interested in — such as one asking about a state’s Senate and governor race — is counted as separate polls when discussing the number of polls for Senate, House and governor races. Our analysis is based on polls whose final date in the field falls between 180 and 15 days from Election Day, which is the equivalent point in the election cycle for 2022 as of Oct. 24 at 2 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> As a result, we have less information about individual contests and are more reliant on polls that could be notably biased toward one party.</p>



<h2><strong>Fewer polls from a smaller number of pollsters</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Simply put, there have been way fewer polls in 2022 than in past cycles. In 2010, pollsters conducted almost 1,700 polls of individual races for Senate, House and governor between early May and late October. By comparison, we have slightly more than half that number this time around — about 900. But this dropoff isn’t sudden; it’s been a more gradual decline over the past decade and a half, as the chart below shows:</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="The number of midterm horse-race polls has been shrinking" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kgMaF/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the overall number of individual races polled has decreased, the number of polls of Senate, House and governors races has varied over these 12 years. This year, we have around 350 polls for both Senate and gubernatorial contests. Compared with 2018, that’s slightly fewer polls of Senate races and slightly more polls of governors races. Still, this is far less than the 500-plus surveys we had of both of those types of races in 2010 and 2014. Meanwhile, the number of House polls has ebbed and flowed since 2010: We only have about 200 House polls over the past six months, almost identical to 2014’s total, whereas we had more than 400 House polls in 2018 and more than 500 in 2010.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, as the number of surveys of races at the state or district level has fallen, the number of national polls that ask about the generic ballot — which asks respondents which party they plan to support in their local U.S. House election — has more than doubled in 2022. This could be down to a couple of factors: For one thing, <a href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/5004334/mod_resource/content/1/Jacobson%202015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics today</a> are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more nationalized</a> than in the past, so pollsters may be incentivized to conduct national surveys, which will get more clicks and views. And it’s also potentially more economical — and safer — to poll a national audience on different issues and the generic ballot — which, for instance, can produce multiple stories for a media organization — than to poll individual races at the state level. The former involves weighting polls by information about the national population, whereas state-level polls may require more difficult choices to properly interpret results, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/12/upshot/polling-midterms-warning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve consistently seen larger errors</a> in certain states than at the national level.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another factor in the decline of polling of individual contests? A smaller number of pollsters are conducting surveys — or at least, releasing results. Over the past six months or so, 150 different pollsters have surveyed Senate, House and gubernatorial elections, down from roughly 190 in 2018 and the smallest total for any midterm in our sample.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While concerning, this trend isn’t necessarily surprising. Polling <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-pollsters-have-changed-since-2016-and-what-still-worries-them-about-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has become</a> more expensive and more challenging, as the response rate to more traditional polling methods, like live telephone calls, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/upshot/midterms-polling-phone-calls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is sometimes below 1 percent</a>. Moreover, recent polling misses in 2016 and 2020 — note that 2018 polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were comparatively better</a> — may have also made major news organizations more hesitant to put themselves out there by releasing surveys of important statewide races. Meanwhile, up-and-comers <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2022/09/19/whats-going-on-with-trafalgars-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with more experimental</a> — and at times, less transparent — methodologies have increased their polling output.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, we’re getting more polls from potentially less reliable sources.</p>



<h2><strong>Partisan sources are releasing a larger share of polls</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because, compared with past cycles, polls in 2022 are more likely to be sponsored or associated with partisan sources. This is a problem because partisan polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to be more inaccurate</a> than polls conducted by or for nonpartisan groups. Internal polls, which are sponsored by candidates’ campaigns, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often try to spin</a> a certain narrative by showing their preferred candidate in a better position than what polls from nonpartisan sources are indicating. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polls page</a>, we denote whether a poll is sponsored by an organization that is considered partisan or is sponsored by a campaign.<a data-footnote-id="35" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-35" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations are considered partisan if they operate on behalf of a candidate, party, campaign committee, &lt;a href="https://www.fec.gov/press/resources-journalists/political-action-committees-pacs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PAC, super PAC, hybrid PAC&lt;/a&gt;, 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(6) organization that conducts a large majority of its political activity on behalf of one political party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>35</sup></a> When we looked at the share of partisan polls in 2022 and for previous midterms, we found that the percentage of polls in Senate, House and gubernatorial contests coming from partisan sources has reached new heights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="A larger share of polls are coming from partisan sources" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oi9mD/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, it’s not unusual to have a high percentage of partisan polls when looking solely at individual House races. House districts usually have smaller populations than states, so they tend to be harder to poll, which means campaigns often do much of the survey work in them. From 2010 to 2018, nearly half of all House polls came from campaigns or partisan groups. Yet that share has climbed to 54 percent this cycle amid a smaller number of overall House polls. Perhaps more disconcertingly, the share of Senate and gubernatorial surveys from partisan sources has risen to about one-third and one-quarter, respectively, even as the overall number of each is similar to 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conversely, we’re seeing a smaller number of horse-race polls conducted by or sponsored by “legacy media” outlets, which we broadly define as longstanding news sources with a major national reach.<a data-footnote-id="36" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-36" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would include major network and cable news outlets, national papers of record, wire services and prominent national news magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>36</sup></a> For instance, in 2010, legacy media sponsored and/or conducted 85 Senate polls and 64 governors polls between May and late October. But in the same span this year, the corresponding figures are just 25 Senate polls and 33 governors surveys.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This situation is perhaps best-illustrated by the rise of The Trafalgar Group, a Republican pollster <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/Polling-Methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that reaches respondents</a> in different ways by using a <a href="https://www.aapor.org/getattachment/Education-Resources/Reports/AAPOR-Mixed-Mode-Task-Force-Executive-Summary-FINAL.pdf.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mixed-mode approach</a>. This cycle, Trafalgar is tied for the most Senate polls conducted (23) and ranks second in gubernatorial surveys (25),<a data-footnote-id="37" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-37" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes one poll Trafalgar conducted in conjunction with InsiderAdvantage, another pollster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>37</sup></a> after releasing only a handful of polls in the same period in 2018 (the pollster <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1322301003090268162?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became more prominent</a> in 2020). In both cases, Trafalgar is either tied with or just trails Emerson College, another mixed-mode pollster that has become prodigious over the past couple of election cycles — although Emerson is nonpartisan.</p>



<h2><strong>We’re flying blind in many House races</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">With fewer total surveys, fewer races have been polled — especially in the House. So far this cycle, we have polls from 96 districts, which represents only about one-fifth of the chamber and is far less polling than the almost 150 districts surveyed in 2018 and nearly 170 in 2010. However, that 96-district figure is a bit deceiving, because only about half of those districts have more than one poll, including races where the same pollster has released more than one. This is problematic not just for the 339 districts for which we have zero polls, but also for our forecast, which takes polling data from districts that have it and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infers numbers</a> for similar-looking districts that lack polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One silver lining, though, is that we have a decent amount of polling in competitive Senate and gubernatorial races. This year, we have an average of about 26 surveys in the eight Senate races rated somewhere from “lean Republican,” to “lean Democratic” by election handicappers at <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cook Political Report</a>, <a href="https://insideelections.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Elections</a> and <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a>, and an average of about 16 surveys in the eight highly competitive gubernatorial contests. That Senate figure is right in between the average number of polls in 2010 and 2014 (about 24 and 29, respectively), helped out in part by the fact that fewer Senate seats are in play this year. The gubernatorial figure is lower than 2010 or 2014 figures but is actually much better than 2018’s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, we have less polling in seemingly uncompetitive statewide races than in most recent midterm cycles, which could make it more likely that we miss a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/governor-maryland-surprise-brown-hogan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late-developing and potentially surprising result</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The state of polling is disconcerting. We have fewer polls, and a larger share of them come from partisan sources. We also have less information about House races, making race-to-race forecasting more perilous. All of this is a challenge for what we do at FiveThirtyEight, and we hope that pollsters and news organizations figure out how to offer the public greater polling information in the future.</p>
