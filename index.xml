<p data-paragraph="main">The Georgia runoff is upon us! Today, the last U.S. Senate election of 2022 will finally be decided. And according to the polls, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is slightly ahead of Republican Herschel Walker — but the election is still very close.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">During the <a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/115465/web.307039/#/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nov. 8</a> general election, Warnock received 49.4 percent of the vote and Walker 48.5 percent. Although other Georgia Republicans won their races comfortably, Warnock’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/all-you-need-to-know-about-georgias-senate-race-through-tv-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advertising</a> and <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/10/06/warnock-walker-ride-eye-popping-fundraising-totals-into-georgias-senate-election-homestretch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising</a> prowess and Walker’s many <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/herschel-walker-responds-to-attack-ad-that-used-ex-wifes-accusations-of-domestic-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandals</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversies</a> helped send this race to a runoff. (Georgia is one of the few states that requires runoff elections when neither candidate gets a majority of the vote in the general election.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We aren’t issuing a forecast for this runoff as we did for the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general election</a>, but we <em>have</em> calculated a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a>. And as of Monday at 4 p.m. Eastern, Warnock was averaging 50.2 percent support, and Walker was averaging 48.2 percent. Again, this isn’t a prediction of the final results, just a summary of the polls conducted of the runoff.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1632" height="890" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">The polls in Georgia ahead of November’s election were pretty accurate. In our final polling average of the state’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election for governor</a>, Republican incumbent Brian Kemp led by 7.9 percentage points. He then won the election by 7.5. And in our final polling average of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Senate general election</a>, Walker led by 1.0 point, which was 2.0 points off the actual election result. Although the polls had the wrong candidate in the lead, they were mathematically quite close to the actual margin. Polls are meant only to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-read-2020-polls-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximate the final result</a>, not predict winners.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, of course, Warnock’s 1.9-point polling lead is not ironclad. Although most of the nine runoff polls give Warnock the lead, every single one has been within the margin of error. (Because margin of error applies to each candidate’s vote share, a candidate’s lead has to be almost twice as large<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.6 times, to be precise, for &lt;a href="https://www.danvk.org/wp/2008-09-25/how-to-read-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;complicated mathematical reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> as the margin of error to be statistically significant.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, a few of these polls have been from pollsters without established track records. That doesn’t mean they will be inaccurate, but it is a reason to take them with a grain of salt. For example, Phillips Academy just started polling this year, so they don’t have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight pollster rating</a>, our assessment of how accurate and methodologically sound pollsters are.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our pollster ratings look at polls conducted in the final 21 days of presidential primary elections as well as general elections for president, governor, U.S. Senate and House since 1998, including polls of special elections and runoffs for these offices. If a pollster has no polls that meet those criteria, it doesn’t get a pollster rating. Because we last updated our pollster ratings &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, new pollsters since then (like Phillips Academy) don’t have ratings yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> The same is true for Patriot Polling, which only surveys people via landline telephone (not cell phones), a methodological red flag. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, Frederick Polls is a Democratic pollster that rarely releases public surveys. From 1998 to 2020, it released only seven polls that qualified for pollster-rating consideration, earning them only a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/frederick-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provisional grade of B/C</a>. Finally, we’ve analyzed 20 polls from Impact Research (under its former name, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/alg-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ALG Research</a>), but only four from <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/fabrizio-lee-associates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates</a>. Moreover, the two organizations’ partnership is new this cycle, so we haven’t had a chance to judge how accurate their polling is in combination.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">However, five surveys from more established pollsters (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/emerson-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/opinion-savvy-insideradvantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InsiderAdvantage</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/ssrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSRS,</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/surveyusa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyUSA</a><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/emerson-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> and the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/university-of-massachusetts-lowell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Massachusetts Lowell</a>) all consistently put Warnock a few points ahead of Walker. That said, it wouldn’t be shocking to see an unexpectedly strong performance from either of the candidates. Other factors agree with the polling that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-either-candidate-could-win-georgias-senate-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this race is tight</a>, and Warnock’s polling lead is still smaller than the average polling error in U.S. Senate races since 1998.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.4 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> While Warnock may be better positioned than Walker, either candidate could still win.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><br>North Carolina is no stranger to making political waves, and in the weeks ahead, the Tar Heel State’s internal battles could create ripple effects across the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in Moore v. Harper, which stems from the North Carolina Supreme Court’s decision to reject a congressional district map drawn by the state legislature that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/04/north-carolina-supreme-court-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court found to be so extremely gerrymandered</a>, it was unconstitutional. The former’s pending ruling <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/moore-v-harper-explained-scotus-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have major ramifications</a> for the division of power over elections in every state in the country. It’s also the culmination of a decade-long effort by North Carolina Republicans to cling onto power. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Depending on how it rules, the Supreme Court could give partisan state lawmakers even greater power to draw district lines and run elections, while weakening the authority of state courts to keep those powers in check. And in charting the course of this case, it’s clear exactly what the plaintiffs — North Carolina Republicans — hope to gain. The story starts over a decade ago, when the GOP took control of the Tar Heel State’s legislature, and winds up at the steps of the Supreme Court, where some of those same Republican lawmakers are hoping to shore up their power in a <a href="https://www.wral.com/data-shows-nc-population-boom-the-nation-s-third-biggest-jump-over-year-span/20369530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast-growing</a> and <a href="https://abc11.com/nc-census-2020-results-data/10948281/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demographically shifting</a> state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">North Carolina’s most <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/the-bathroom-bill-that-ate-north-carolina-214944/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme political maneuvers</a> have threatened to seep <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/states-see-a-new-wave-of-transgender-bathroom-bills/512453/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out and radicalize</a> other parts of the country before. Moore v. Harper could spring an actual leak.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Moore v. Harper emerged from a quagmire of political warfare that has been swirling in the Tar Heel State for decades. It all began … well, truthfully, it all began a few centuries ago, but for brevity’s sake, let’s start in the slightly more recent history: the 2010 midterms. Republicans rode a red wave to win control of both the North Carolina House and Senate for the <a href="https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-north-carolina-southern-progressivism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first time since Reconstruction</a>. The win was partially aided by REDMAP, a project helmed by former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gillespie-took-partisan-map-making-to-a-new-level-try-turning-that-into-a-bumper-sticker/2017/10/31/03dd5b32-ba93-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funneled funds into statehouse races with the explicit aim</a> of gaining Republican control over the upcoming redistricting cycle following the 2010 census. And since North Carolina is one of a minority of states where <a href="https://governors.rutgers.edu/governors-and-the-redistricting-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the governor has virtually no power</a> over drawing district maps, the newly GOP-controlled state assembly had total control over the redistricting process. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They wasted no time getting to work, hiring a GOP strategist renowned <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/the-league-of/309084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for his skill at crafting</a> expertly gerrymandered maps. He lived up to his reputation, helping the state legislature draw a map that would have likely given Republicans <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/the-league-of/309084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an additional four Congressional seats</a>. It was quickly <a href="https://southerncoalition.org/redistricting-lawsuit-filed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenged in court</a> by a coalition of voter rights groups including the state NAACP and League of Women’s Voters, kicking off a protracted saga of courtroom battles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every single election after that, with the exception of 2020, […] every one of those maps adopted, state and congressional, were eventually tossed and ruled unconstitutional,” said Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a nonpartisan government reform group that has frequently joined on court challenges over the maps. “And I don’t know if there’s any other state in America that can say that.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013853788627.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013853788627.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013853788627.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013853788627.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Political activists in North Carolina have long campaigned against gerrymandered state legislative and congressional maps.</figcaption></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the legal ping-pong continued, it was no secret that state lawmakers were set on drawing maps that would favor the GOP. At the time, Rep. David Lewis, a Republican member of the General Assembly’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/politics/gerrymandering-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting committee said</a>: “I propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats, because I do not believe it’s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.” These maps weren’t just theoretically skewed in the Republicans’ favor: In <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/11/7/7173403/gerrymandering-2014-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election</a> after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/13/least-three-states-republicans-lost-popular-vote-won-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election</a>, Democrats would receive a much lower share of seats compared to their share of the popular vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This legal battle eventually made its way to the Supreme Court in 2019 as <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/18-422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rucho v. Common Cause</a> (Rucho being Bob Rucho, the former chair of the state Senate Redistricting Committee). In a landmark 5-4 ruling, the court seemed to put the whole issue to bed by essentially saying “actually, federal courts don’t have a say when it comes to cases around partisan gerrymandering,” closing down one avenue to legally challenge extremely gerrymandered maps. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while all that cartographical drama was unfolding, there were yet more power struggles happening in the statehouse. In the heady final weeks heading into the 2016 election, Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the southeast portion of the state, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/readiness/stories/nc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing widespread, deadly flooding</a> and otherwise wreaking havoc for weeks. By December, it was perfectly reasonable for the GOP-controlled General Assembly to hold an emergency session to avail disaster relief funds. And if it happened to use that session to also <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/north-carolina-special-session-republicans-roy-cooper/510731/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strip the incoming Democratic governor</a> of various powers and responsibilities — notably the power to appoint members of the state election board — well, that was just the cherry on top. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The election of former Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory as governor four years earlier had given Republicans in the state a rare trifecta, and they weren’t going to relinquish such power without a fight. After his defeat in 2016, McCrory’s campaign set up a legal defense fund and <a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/undecided-gubernatorial-race-presents-problems-for-candidates/468201866/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protested vote counts</a> in 50 counties, citing “irregularities” and making allegations of voter fraud, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pat-mccrory-greensboro-north-carolina-raleigh-gubernatorial-elections-00c5b154efc6c8fc425dd7db22b03733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for which some campaign supporters were later sued</a>, before <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/05/504437210/ending-closest-governors-race-in-n-c-history-pat-mccrory-concedes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conceding a month</a> after the election. Then the state assembly stripped incoming Gov. Roy Cooper of much of the powers the office had enjoyed — most of which Cooper <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/03/north-carolina-legislative-power-grab-blocked-in-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clawed back through lawsuits</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McCrory said this wasn’t a partisan move because that same legislature had actually tried to strip powers from the governor even while he was still in office — he, too, <a href="https://www.wral.com/mccrory-sues-legislature-over-unconstitutional-commissions/14178019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to sue</a> to keep certain powers under the administrative branch. “There are constantly power struggles between the legislature and the executive branch, and not just with the governor,” McCrory said in an interview with FiveThirtyEight. “That’s been a constant battle in North Carolina for years.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, the pandemic ushered in a new drama. Republicans in the state legislature <a href="https://carolinapublicpress.org/38287/cutting-through-the-true-and-false-claims-and-confusing-legal-developments-on-nc-by-mail-balloting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to get the Supreme Court to weigh in</a> on a dispute over changes to election rules around the pandemic, but they were rebuffed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just as disputes over the last district maps, drawn a decade earlier, finally came to a close, it was time to draw new maps once again. Thanks to the continued flow of new residents to the Tar Heel State, North Carolina gained a new district after the 2020 census. The state legislature <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/cst22_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved a map</a> that converted 13 districts — eight Republican-leaning seats, five Democratic-leaning ones — to 14, with three highly competitive districts, four Democratic-leaning seats and seven Republican-leaning ones. It went about as well as the last time the state went through redistricting. Voting rights groups sued, and the Democrat-controlled state Supreme Court <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/04/north-carolina-supreme-court-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw the maps out and ordered the lawmakers</a> to try again. When the state legislature presented new maps to a three-judge panel, the state House and Senate lines were affirmed — <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article258665653.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but not the congressional districts</a>. At this point, with the primary elections looming, the judges enlisted a group of outside experts to draw up <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps to be used in the meantime</a>. The state Supreme Court <a href="https://ncpolicywatch.com/2022/02/24/judges-replace-the-nc-congressional-redistricting-plan-the-state-supreme-court-denies-all-requests-for-a-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled it was within the lower court’s authority</a> to do so. The state legislature disagreed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But to get the Supreme Court to weigh in on these kinds of state-level issues, Republicans in the statehouse needed a constitutional hook. They had toyed with just such a legal hook when trying to get the Supreme Court to arbitrate the pandemic disputes, and while the court declined to take up the case, some of the more conservative justices <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/moore-v-harper-explained-scotus-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaled support for the legal theory Republicans put forward</a>, emboldening the GOP to find another way to get it in front of the court. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The independent state legislature theory is based on a very literal interpretation of a line in the U.S. Constitution (in Article 1, Section 4), <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/clause-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which reads</a>: “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.” Disregarding the gratuitous use of capital letters, that basically means that states get to set up all the rules around election administration — like whether voters can vote by mail, or what time polling locations close — unless Congress has created a superseding rule, like the fact that elections <a href="https://www.history.com/news/why-is-election-day-a-tuesday-in-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must be held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday</a> in November. The key words are “legislature thereof,” which proponents of the ISL theory take at face value: Legislatures alone are charged with determining how elections are run in their respective states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"> </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013854093856.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013854093856.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013854093856.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP20013854093856.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Since 2010, when Republicans in the state legislature swept into power, North Carolina has been an epicenter for political warfare over the fairness of congressional and state legislative maps. </figcaption></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Opponents of this theory <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/11/04/the-independent-state-legislature-theory-will-not-empower-state-legislatures-to-override-presidential-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argue that historical context and centuries of precedence</a> show that “legislature” means all of the state bodies that are generally involved in setting laws, including not only legislatures but also constitutions, courts and election boards. And in fact, in its ruling in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Supreme Court explicitly noted that federal courts shouldn’t be weighing in on partisan gerrymandering … but <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/588/18-422/#tab-opinion-4114539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state courts could</a>, based on state statutes and constitutions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jason Torchinsky, a senior adviser and general counsel for the National Republican Redistricting Trust who has <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/2022.09.06_Amici_RNC%20et%20al..pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written an amicus brief</a> for Moore v. Harper, said he didn’t see the case as aimed at stripping state courts of their role in redistricting. Instead, he said the main issue was whether the court overstepped its bounds by instituting new maps, rather than simply striking down the original maps.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don’t know that there would be a decision that would basically say, ‘No challenges under the state constitution may ever be brought in North Carolina,’ because I don’t think that that’s what this case is about,” Torchinsky said. “This case is about that line drawing that I mentioned. There’s a difference between interpreting a law and making a policy.”</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Once again, political power struggles within North Carolina threaten to leach out into the rest of the country. If the Supreme Court decides to endorse even part of the ISL theory, it could sap the power state courts have to serve as a check on state legislatures when it comes to redistricting or elections more broadly. Already limited in what cases they could bring to federal court, voters unhappy with the laws their elected officials pass could lose yet another avenue to make their case. It could even mean that voter-led changes to election laws — like the efforts that brought <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/09/15/why-alaska-uses-ranked-choice-voting-and-what-we-know-about-how-it-affects-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice ballots to Alaska</a> or established an <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2018/11/07/colorado-amendments-y-z-independent-panels-for-redistricting-have-passed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent redistricting committee</a> in Colorado — could be made illegitimate since they weren’t enacted by the state legislature. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This case goes beyond the borders of North Carolina, but understanding the political climate that spawned it gives a clear picture of what’s at stake for the rest of the country. The ongoing political warfare to gain and hold power could be replicated in other states by politicians of both parties, if ISL theory — even partially — becomes the law of the land.  </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, the U.S. men’s national team defeated Iran 1-0 in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-played-to-win-against-iran-and-it-worked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grueling soccer match</a> to advance to the 2022 World Cup’s round of 16. Next up, the team will face the Netherlands on Saturday in a win-or-go-home game in which the U.S. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-world-cup-predictions/matches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be the underdog</a> — but not a total longshot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet while the U.S. team’s on-field performance has surely pleased Americans, a substantial chunk of the country remains skeptical of the decision to hold the tournament in Qatar. The host country has drawn scrutiny for not only the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/soccer/qatar-and-russia-bribery-world-cup-fifa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegedly corrupt manner</a> in which it won hosting rights, but also for its <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/qatar/report-qatar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human rights practices</a>, including discrimination against women and LGBTQ people, and the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistreatment of migrant workers</a>, who <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/11/14/qatar-rights-abuses-stain-fifa-world-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered from labor abuses</a> such as wage theft, injury or death while building the gleaming infrastructure used for the World Cup. Still, such wariness has not notably dissuaded Americans from tuning in to watch the tournament.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans may have actually become more critical of the decision to have Qatar host the World Cup since it began. In late October, before the event kicked off, <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/sport/articles-reports/2022/11/11/europeans-and-americans-hosting-world-cup-qatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov surveyed attitudes in six Western nations</a>, including the U.S., and found Americans didn’t notably favor or oppose Qatar hosting. Asked if it was acceptable or unacceptable for Qatar to hold international sporting events, 31 percent of Americans (which included a mix of self-identified soccer fans and non-fans) <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/nsr9bko9vy/YouGov%20-%20World%20Cup%202022%20boycotts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said it was acceptable</a> compared with 22 percent who said it was unacceptable. Forty-seven percent said they weren’t sure. By contrast, most other Western nations didn’t think Qatar hosting a major athletic event was acceptable: Majorities of respondents (which again included a mix of fans and non-fans) in France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. said it was unacceptable, though 46 percent of Italians said it was acceptable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But subsequent polling from YouGov/The Economist found a greater share of Americans viewed it as wrong for Qatar to host the World Cup specifically. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/gebmjsbpbw/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In mid-November</a>, just before the event started, 36 percent of Americans said it was wrong for Qatar to host in light of the criticisms over the country’s “human rights record and stance on LGBTQ+ rights,” while 23 percent thought it was right for Qatar to host (41 percent weren’t sure). But <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/3jonl2kylh/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two weeks later</a>, 45 percent said it was wrong for Qatar to host, while 18 percent said it was right (37 percent weren’t sure).<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second iteration of the question excluded the mention of Qatar’s stance on LGBTQ+ rights, which may have influenced the result to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> Many Americans don’t have an opinion, but the increase in net opposition to Qatar’s host status (from +13 to +27) suggests a large section of the public is critical.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans also seem favorably disposed toward addressing human rights concerns in Qatar. Another YouGov poll, conducted in August and September <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/qatar-global-survey-shows-overwhelming-demand-for-fifa-to-compensate-world-cup-migrant-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on behalf of Amnesty International</a>, found 54 percent of Americans agreed that U.S. soccer officials should speak out on human rights issues associated with Qatar, while 56 percent supported FIFA using some of the money generated by the tournament to compensate migrant workers who have suffered while preparing the country for the event. Now, Americans were comparatively less supportive of both prompts than most of the other 14 countries polled, but the U.S. also had a larger share of people who weren’t sure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, controversy surrounding aspects of this World Cup hasn’t necessarily made Americans want the U.S. team to pull out of the tournament. The most recent poll from YouGov/The Economist found that 32 percent said the U.S. team should have boycotted the World Cup while 31 percent opposed the idea (37 percent weren’t sure), which means a notably smaller share favored this more aggressive action than the share that said it was wrong for Qatar to host.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it turns out plenty of Americans have been watching. Headed into the tournament, polls from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/11/21/world-cup-2022-american-fan-viewership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a>, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-11/Ipsos%202022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Global%20Advisor%20Survey%20-%20Global%20Press%20Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos</a> and <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/b75fbhixvm/Amnesty%20International%20World%20Cup%20-%20US%20Results%20-%20148%2025.08.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Amnesty International</a> found that around a quarter of Americans were likely to watch at least some of the event. It’s true that the internationally focused Reuters and YouGov/Amnesty International surveys put the U.S. well toward the bottom of countries polled when it came to the population share who planned to follow the World Cup. Yet this isn’t that surprising, considering <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/12/world-cup-us-soccer-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soccer usually ranks</a> behind other team sports like (American) football, basketball, baseball and (sometimes) hockey in terms of Americans’ level of general interest, whereas <a href="https://statisticsanddata.org/most-popular-sports-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soccer is the most popular sport</a> in most other nations. Despite this, Americans are still tuning in: Nearly 20 million <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/world-cup/2022/11/29/6386436f268e3eae298b4582.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watched the U.S. team’s second group match</a> — against England — which Fox Sports said was the most-watched men’s soccer game in U.S. history.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even as this World Cup moves into the “knockout” stage, we can look ahead a bit to 2026, when the U.S. will co-host <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next World Cup</a> with Canada and Mexico. So we’ll be hearing plenty about international soccer in the coming months and years, no matter what happens against the Dutch.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Led by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-partisan-divide-hasnt-been-this-sharp-in-generations/">a conservative majority</a>, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently released decisions that favor conservative religious values and groups, including <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392">overturning the constitutional right to an abortion</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1088_dbfi.pdf">refusing to allow</a> states to exclude private religious schools from certain public funding programs. As a result, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/11/30/growing-share-of-americans-see-the-supreme-court-as-friendly-toward-religion/">the Pew Research Center recently found</a> that 35 percent of Americans viewed the court as “friendly” toward religion, up from 18 percent in 2019. By comparison, 51 percent considered the court “neutral” toward religion, down from 69 percent in 2019, while an equivalent share (11 percent) said it was “unfriendly” in 2019 and 2022. Americans across most demographic and religious groups increasingly viewed the court as friendly toward religion, with some of the largest shifts coming among Democrats (52 percent said the court was friendly, up from 25 percent in 2019), the religiously unaffiliated (51 percent, up from 26 percent) and those with a four-year college degree (48 percent, up from 23 percent).</li><li>As society enters a potentially volatile period for social media, <a href="https://www.grid.news/story/technology/2022/11/23/twitter-and-tiktok-get-all-the-attention-polling-shows-few-us-adults-use-them/">Harris/Grid conducted a poll to examine</a> social media usage among American adults. Facebook remained dominant as 75 percent of Americans reported using it in the past six months, while YouTube was close behind at 71 percent. About half (51 percent) said they used Instagram, but only 34 percent said the same of Twitter and TikTok. But there were sizable generational differences, as the youngest Americans in the poll (Gen Z) were far more likely to use YouTube, Instagram and TikTok than older Americans.</li><li>In <a href="https://politics.georgetown.edu/2022/11/30/november-2022-battleground-civility-poll/">its post-midterm survey</a>, the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Civility Poll found that 75 percent of Americans agreed that “democracy is under attack,” while only 24 percent disagreed. Americans of all political stripes mostly agreed, including 80 percent of Democrats, 72 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of independents. Most people agreed, regardless of their party affiliation, that biased news coverage, decreasing respect and civility, social media self-reinforcing users’ views and an increasing amount of violent behavior were extremely or very serious threats to democracy. But Democrats and Republicans strongly disagreed about other issues, with Republicans far more likely to say that “voter fraud causing stolen elections” and “woke culture imposing out of touch liberal values” were extremely or very serious threats, while Democrats were much more inclined to say this regarding “voter suppression and intimidation efforts.”</li><li><a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/12/01/covid-19-vaccines-booster-shot-survey-data/">Morning Consult found</a> a slight decline in the share of Americans who plan to get a COVID-19 booster sometime in the next year. In mid-November, 53 percent of U.S. adults said they would “definitely” or “probably” get a booster, down from 58 percent in September. When respondents who were already vaccinated but not boosted were asked for “major” or “minor” reasons why they weren’t getting a booster shot, 45 percent said they didn’t see the point and 40 percent said they weren’t worried about getting COVID-19.</li><li>COVID-19 is still on some Americans’ minds as they start to make holiday plans, though, according to a <a href="https://time.com/6235801/covid-19-holiday-plans/">Harris/Time survey</a>. Overall, there’s evidence that concerns about COVID-19 may be ebbing, since 72 percent of American adults planned to celebrate with at least one person outside their household, down from 81 percent in 2019 but up from 66 percent from 2021. But traveling for the holidays may still be more limited than it was before the pandemic, as 45 percent said they planned to go somewhere for the holidays, up only slightly from 42 percent in 2021 and down from 58 percent in 2019. And 55 percent said concerns about COVID-19 will affect their holiday plans, with around one-third specifically planning to limit the size of their gatherings.</li><li>Now that it’s early December, Americans are ready to be bombarded with holiday advertising. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/11/28/holiday-marketing-timing-november/">Morning Consult survey</a> in mid-November found that about half of Americans said that mid-November or late November were “just right” for brands to begin holiday marketing campaigns. In fact, 53 percent said early December was “somewhat” or “way” too late for brands to start advertising. But an overwhelming 66 percent thought that starting holiday advertising in mid-October was somewhat or way too early. One thing is for sure: Americans like holiday ads. The survey found that 70 percent said they were at least somewhat enjoyable while only 24 percent said they were somewhat or mostly annoying.</li></ul>

<p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 election for the House of Representatives was so close<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like Republicans will wind up with 222 seats and Democrats with 213. One district, the California 13th, still does not have a projected winner, but the Republican is in the lead as of Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> that if any number of things had gone differently, Democrats might have kept their majority. And one of the biggest things that affected the battle for the House was redistricting — the decennial redrawing of congressional districts’ lines to account for the results of the 2020 census.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But was the impact of redistricting significant enough to swing the House to the GOP? <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As I wrote in June</a>, the 2021-22 redistricting cycle didn’t radically change the partisanship of the national House map, so I mostly agree with those who say <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/18/gerrymandering-did-not-cost-democrats-house-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting didn’t cost Democrats the House</a>. But at the same time, those who say <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/11/16/2136410/-Republicans-just-took-control-of-the-House-because-of-partisan-and-racial-gerrymandering-Here-s-how" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans won only because they gerrymandered</a> are also technically correct. How can both things be true? Allow me to explain. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One way to test the claim that “redistricting cost Democrats the House” is to assess whether Democrats would have held onto the chamber if redistricting had never happened. We at FiveThirtyEight have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already calculated</a> how many percentage points each district swung left or right thanks to redistricting. For example, a district that went from a partisan lean<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> of R+2 to D+3 got 5 points bluer. Then I compared this swing to the current 2022 House margin in that district.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Monday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> Suppose a party lost by less than the district swung away from that party in redistricting. In that case, it’s likely that redistricting cost that party the seat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this is a hypothetical — and imperfect — exercise. Some districts changed substantially and wouldn’t have swung uniformly like that had they not been redrawn.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some old districts, it’s not even obvious which new district they should be paired with. I used the &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-redistricting-tracker-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;same methodology&lt;/a&gt; we used in the redistricting tracker: a combination of how much the districts overlap and where the old district’s incumbent ran for reelection, if they ran at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a> In addition, if they had not changed, different districts might have attracted different candidates and different levels of spending from national groups, each of which could have affected the result. But this method can still give us a rough idea of what might have happened in a redistricting-less world.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using this method, we can see that Republicans flipped a net six seats because of redistricting.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans flipped three seats in Florida alone thanks to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extreme-bias-of-floridas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely GOP-friendly map</a> pushed through by Gov. Ron DeSantis. They also used their control over the Georgia and Tennessee redistricting processes to convert the Democratic-held Georgia 6th and Tennessee 5th into safely red seats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Democrats also caught a few bad breaks in states with ostensibly nonpartisan redistricting processes. For example, the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission made the 2nd and 6th districts<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly numbered the 1st and 2nd, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> about 10 points more Republican-leaning. In Michigan, the state’s Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission redrew the 10th District<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly the light-blue 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> to be light red. And court-appointed experts nudged the New York 17th and Virginia 2nd rightward enough that they flipped too. Meanwhile, Democrats on the New Jersey Congressional Redistricting Commission voluntarily sacrificed the 7th District to protect vulnerable Democrats in other districts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, Democrats flipped a few seats thanks to redistricting. They drew some very Democrat-friendly maps in Illinois and New Mexico, enabling them to pick up the Illinois 13th and New Mexico 2nd. A court reconfigured North Carolina’s 13th District from a solidly red seat into a swing district that Democrats narrowly carried. And Republicans made the Ohio 1st District and Texas 34th District bluer, with the unfortunate (for them) side effect of handing those seats to Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we also need to consider seats that <em>didn’t</em> flip but <em>would have </em>if redistricting had not occurred. And this is where Democrats benefited the most, gaining six seats on net — and canceling out Republicans’ gains from the flips that did occur.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats drew maps that likely allowed them to avoid losing the Illinois 14th, Illinois 17th, Nevada 3rd, Nevada 4th and Oregon 4th. They also held onto the New Jersey 3rd thanks partly to their sacrifice of the 7th District. Meanwhile, court-ordered maps probably kept the New York 18th and Virginia 7th in the Democrats’ column. And Democrats may even have DeSantis to thank for them holding Florida’s 9th District: The district got 12 points bluer in redistricting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Republicans redrew Nebraska’s 2nd District to be a tad redder, which may have saved their <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/don_bacon/412713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bacon</a>. The court-ordered map in New York also may have enabled Republicans to hold onto the New York 22nd.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly numbered the 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> And Rep. Lauren Boebert probably would have lost without the Colorado Independent Congressional Redistricting Commission making the Colorado 3rd a bit redder.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats also gained a net three seats from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reapportionment</a>, the process of subtracting congressional districts from states with sluggish population growth and giving them to states whose populations have exploded. Six of the seven districts that were eliminated by reapportionment were held by Republicans — slow-growth areas tended to be in rural and/or postindustrial areas, where Republicans usually dominate. But Republicans won only three of the seven districts that were created in reapportionment, for a net Democratic gain of three seats.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">By my reckoning, Democrats actually <em>gained</em> three seats from redistricting overall. In other words, without redistricting, Republicans’ majority would be closer to 225-210.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“But wait,” I hear you saying. “There was no world in which redistricting wouldn’t have occurred in 2021-22. So isn’t it better to calculate how the 2022 election would have gone down if redistricting had <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-alternate-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone differently</a>, not if it hadn’t happened at all?” You have a point — but the problem is, there is no objective alternative map. The congressional map could have changed in a thousand ways depending on individual, state-level decisions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, let’s engage in a few of the most commonly cited what-ifs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past year and a half, Democrats have filed <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/cases/?cycles%5B%5D=2020&amp;levels%5B%5D=Congress&amp;sortby=-updated&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several lawsuits</a> against Republican-drawn congressional maps, arguing that they are illegal partisan or racial gerrymanders. Some of these were successful, like in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>. But most weren’t resolved in time to prevent the Republican-drawn maps from being used in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what if they had been? Specifically, let’s pose a set of hypotheticals:</p>



<ul><li>The Supreme Court had instead agreed with lower-court rulings that <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/24/alabama-congressional-map-blocked-federal-court/9205925002/">Alabama’s</a> and <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2022/06/06/federal-court-rejects-louisiana-congressional-map/">Louisiana’s</a> maps <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/">violated the Voting Rights Act</a>, and that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_a/">each state</a> adopted a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb6/">new map</a> with a second Black-majority district. </li><li>A <a href="https://jaxtrib.org/2022/05/11/judge-strikes-down-part-of-florida-congressional-redistricting-map/">Florida judge’s decision</a> to reinstate a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/remedial_map_a/">Black-plurality district in North Florida</a> (which DeSantis’s map had eliminated) hadn’t been overturned on appeal.</li><li>The Ohio Supreme Court, which found in July that the state’s congressional map is <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/19/ohio-supreme-court-strikes-down-congressional-map-used-may-primary/9359835002/">unconstitutionally gerrymandered</a> but left the map in place for 2022 because it was too close to the election, had instead imposed <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/house_democratic_caucus/">this map</a> drawn by Democratic state representatives that scores well on various metrics of fairness. </li><li>A court in Utah had rejected the map passed by Republican legislators in favor of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/utah/orange_3_3/">this fairer map</a> drawn by the state’s (toothless) independent redistricting commission.</li></ul>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this world, Democrats probably would have won five more seats than they actually did.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1112" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rakich.REDISTRICTING-HOUSE.1201-3mf2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rakich.REDISTRICTING-HOUSE.1201-3mf2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rakich.REDISTRICTING-HOUSE.1201-3mf2.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rakich.REDISTRICTING-HOUSE.1201-3mf2.png?w=1340 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">This doesn’t even account for other lawsuits that voting-rights advocates filed in states like <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/12/31/lawsuits-claim-georgias-redistricting-maps-ignore-black-population-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-naacp-south-carolina-lawsuits-house-elections-eb3c5825d5c9582b708a3c7ddffd541d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Carolina</a> and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/18/texas-redistricting-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas</a>. There, we don’t have good alternative fair maps to compare with, but it’s safe to say that if the courts had ruled in Democrats’ favor, Democrats would have won a few more extra seats too. Regardless, five additional seats for Democrats would have been enough for them to hold onto a slim 218-217 majority. So yes, if every Republican gerrymander had been undone in court before the 2022 election, Democrats may have kept control of the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s assuming no additional <em>Democratic</em> gerrymanders were thrown out in court. Republicans also filed suit against <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2463334/nm-republican-party-files-lawsuit-over-new-congressional-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2021/10/12/oregon-republicans-sue-over-new-congressional-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/las-vegas-lawsuits-nevada-legislature-voting-rights-d53e0f74ac895521aea441d242cfbea2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps</a> that were biased toward Democrats. What if a court had overturned New Mexico’s map and replaced it with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/concept_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this map</a> drawn by the state’s advisory redistricting commission? Republicans would have almost certainly kept control of the state’s 2nd District. Or what if a court had struck down <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada’s map</a> and imposed a plan closer to the status quo? The GOP very well could have flipped the 3rd or 4th districts there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is, it’s impossible to say whether Democrats would have won the House in a world where no state was gerrymandered. The definition of a “fair map” is subjective, and there’s uncertainty about what type of map a court might have imposed in states like Nevada or Texas. The one thing we do know is that it would have been close. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But let’s also not lose sight of the bigger picture. Votes are still being counted in some states, but it looks like Republicans won the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/charts/house-charts/national-house-vote-tracker/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national popular vote for the House</a> by about 3 points.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for this is because &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-3-big-questions-i-still-have-about-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Democrats left more seats uncontested&lt;/a&gt; than Republicans did, missing out on hundreds of thousands of votes. But this was probably worth only 1-2 points of the popular-vote margin, so Republicans would have won the national popular vote anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a> The national congressional map used in the 2022 election may not have been fair, but a map that gave Democrats the majority despite losing the popular vote <em>definitely</em> wouldn’t have been. So it’s somewhat beside the point whether redistricting cost Democrats the House: Republicans won the most votes, so the most democratic (lower-case “d”) outcome prevailed.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/runoffs-are-sort-of-georgias-thing-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are headed to a runoff</a> in Georgia’s Senate race next week after neither surpassed the 50 percent threshold required by state law to win outright. But will it be a repeat of last year’s runoff — when Warnock and fellow Democratic then-candidate Sen. Jon Ossoff <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly defeated their Republican rivals</a>? Or are we heading for an election that makes 2021 look like an outlier?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The stakes of the race are high, even though Democrats have already <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-control-senate-abc-news-projects/story?id=92681603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clinched their 50-seat majority</a>, as an additional seat would give the party more leverage over its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-why-politicians-like-manchin-and-sinema-go-rogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more conservative members</a> and allow it to claim <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/democrats-better-shape-51-senate-seats-rcna57230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majorities on every committee</a>. Plus, a Warnock win would <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/georgia-runoff-democrats-2024-senate-map/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better position the party for the 2024 cycle</a>. For Republicans, a Walker win would force Democrats to rely on Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote and serve as a blow to that cushion Democrats <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/difference-51-seat-senate-democratic-majority-make/story?id=93278188" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so desperately want</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, both parties have a lot to gain — and lose — based on the upcoming runoff election. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/06/warnock-beats-loeffler-455290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You’ve read this book before</a>, right? Well, it’s worth remembering that the sequel might look a bit different, as Ossoff and Warnock’s previous wins bucked prior Georgia runoff historical trends. In fact, in the past, Republicans have typically dominated Georgia’s runoffs.</p>

 <p>*Special election</p>
 <p>Georgia rules require a candidate to win a majority of the vote in general elections or special elections; if no candidate wins a majority, there is a runoff between the top-two finishers. If a special election took place on a regular general election date, it is included in this table. In these cases, there may be multiple candidates from each party running, so the Democratic and Republican totals are the combined vote share of all candidates from that party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">However, because of what happened during the 2020 cycle and the fact that recent polling shows that this race could be a tight one, it’s hard to rely <em>only</em> on historical data. The first poll of the runoff, a November <a href="https://states.aarp.org/georgia/new-aarp-georgia-poll-voters-50-may-tip-scales-in-runoff-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research survey for AARP</a>, showed the incumbent with 51 percent support from voters versus Walker’s 47 percent. But a second, more recent, <a href="https://andoverpoll.com/2022/11/28/herschel-walker-up-by-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phillips Academy Poll</a> of likely voters, on the other hand, showed Walker and Warnock essentially neck-and-neck (48 percent to 47 percent, respectively) with 5 percent of voters still undecided. And a third <a href="https://competeeverywhere.com/2022/11/frederickpolls-and-compete-digital-release-ga-senate-run-off-poll-showing-50-50-race-with-warning-signs-for-warnock-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FrederickPolls, Compete Digital, and AMM Political</a> survey of likely runoff voters had the two men tied at 50 percent support each.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All this is to say that, this go-around, there are a number of factors working in both Warnock <em>and </em>Walker’s favor. So what’s the case that we’re heading for another 2021? And what’s the case for an outcome that looks like — er — most other statewide runoffs in Georgia’s history?</p>



<h2><strong>The case for a Warnock victory </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2021, Warnock and Ossoff won, in part, by gaining on President Biden’s November 2020 margins, especially in counties with the largest shares of Black voters. That could be because Democrats worked <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-democrats-may-have-found-their-own-southern-strategy-a-black-centric-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overtime to turn out their voters</a> and prominent figures like Stacey Abrams, the state’s 2018 and 2022 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pioneered a new playbook</a> to get voters of color out to the polls, marshaling the political power of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the growing number of Black people</a> who have moved to Georgia over the past two decades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Warnock is again <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/13/georgia-senate-runoff-warnock-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banking on voters of color</a> to deliver for him. And they very well could: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/georgia-senate-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exit polling data</a> from earlier this month (which is imperfect and subject to change) shows that roughly 28 percent of the voting electorate in Georgia was Black while 6 percent was Latino, roughly the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same shares as in 2020</a>. This shows that turnout among these blocs didn’t notably tick down despite it being a midterm election with very different dynamics from 2020 and it <em>could</em> be a sign that energy remains high among these groups. And that lines up with other polling suggesting that Warnock supporters are just more excited about backing their candidate than Walker supporters. An October <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/GA-topline_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-October-26-30_released-November-2-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> poll found that 63 percent of Warnock proponents backed the Democrat “enthusiastically,” compared with 49 percent who said the same of Walker. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, this enthusiasm gap became obvious on Election Day, when every other statewide Georgia Republican <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/11/10/republicans-sweep-georgia-state-offices-retain-legislature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won their race outright</a>. And while Warnock got the most votes of any Democratic statewide candidate, Walker got the <em>least</em> votes of any Republican candidate.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Georgia turnout numbers as of Nov. 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> It’s clear some split-ticket voting took place, too, as Gov. Brian Kemp, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgia-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92009770" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who sailed to reelection against</a> Abrams, earned over 2.11 million voters versus Walker’s 1.91 million. Warnock also finished a tad ahead of Walker in the first ballot, with 1.94 million votes, so he might have the easier path to the 50 percent winning threshold.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This discrepancy makes some sense, too, given that Walker is at the center of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/4/23387712/herschel-walker-georgia-senate-raphael-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous controversies</a>, including allegations that he encouraged and/or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-woman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid for multiple women</a> to terminate their pregnancies (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/herschel-walker-denies-new-abortion-allegation-rcna54205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which Walker denies</a>), despite once campaigning on a platform that included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a total ban on abortions</a>. More recently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/politics/kfile-herschel-walker-texas-tax-break-georgia-runoff/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN reported</a> that Walker is receiving a tax exemption on his home in Texas, which is meant for primary residents of the state, even as he ran for Senate in Georgia. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Of the roughly 2 million votes that went for Walker, some of them were bound to be from Republicans who had to grit their teeth and close their eyes and vote for him because they wanted to see a Republican Senate to put checks on Joe Biden,” said <a href="https://spia.uga.edu/faculty-member/charles-s-bullock-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Bullock III</a>, a political science professor at the University of Georgia. “Well, that’s off the table now.” As a result, he said, those same voters might stay home in this year’s runoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And with no other Republicans on the ballot, Walker won’t have the added benefit of riding another candidate’s coattails during the December runoff. Warnock also has the small — but not insignificant — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advantage of incumbency</a> on his side. Plus, he’s a fundraising behemoth, with nearly <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0GA00559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$29.7 million on hand</a> as of Nov. 16, compared with Walker’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2GA00225/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9.8 million</a>, and has the support of Democratic heavyweights like <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-11-21/obama-to-campaign-for-warnock-on-dec-1-before-ga-runoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Barack Obama</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The last wildcard that <em>could </em>benefit Warnock is Trump. His recently announced presidential run and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/georgia-senate-election-donald-trump-defends-herschel-walker-after-abortion-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing of Walker</a> could motivate Democrats who “don’t want to give him a win,” Bullock told me. Republicans in the state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/us/politics/trump-herschel-walker-georgia-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similarly raised concerns</a> about whether Trump’s involvement in the race could hurt Walker, but Warnock is <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1593248795802095622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already running TV ads</a> tying his opponent to the former president. </p>



<h2><strong>The case for a Walker victory </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we’d be silly to write off Walker’s candidacy in this race. (There’s a reason why our final Deluxe forecast, which was frozen early Nov. 8, estimated that Walker would have a significant edge in a runoff). If nothing else, he may still be helped by the state’s historical tendency toward a more Republican-leaning runoff electorate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we’ve written previously, in the 11 runoffs between a Democrat and a Republican for statewide office, held between the late 1960s and 2020, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most favored Republicans</a>. In fact, in seven of those races, the runoff margin was better for the GOP than the general-election margin. This is largely attributable to the drop-off in turnout — fewer people vote in runoff races than in general elections — and the decline usually disproportionately affects Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That wasn’t the case last year, but that was in part because Trump dissuaded Republicans from trusting the state’s electoral system — which <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/turnout-dip-among-georgia-republicans-flipped-us-senate/IKWGEGFEEVEZ5DXTP7ZXXOROIA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dampened GOP voter turnout</a>. But Trump is doing the exact opposite this year.<em> </em>In fact, during his 2024 presidential campaign announcement, the former president implored Republicans to support Walker, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/11/15/trump-announces-a-third-bid-for-the-presidency-even-as-gop-reels-from-midterm-setback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling him</a> “a fabulous human being who loves our country.” On top of that, Walker has also held events <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/us/politics/herschel-walker-raphael-warnock-georgia-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in metro Atlanta</a> in recent weeks — which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-georgia-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bellwether for statewide Democrats</a> — and is receiving significant outside support from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/brian-kemp-stars-new-tv-ad-boost-herschel-walker-rcna58520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national Republican-aligned groups</a> to bolster his candidacy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Walker is also receiving a lift this go-around from an unlikely ally: Kemp. After <a href="https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/brian-kemp-campaigned-and-won-at-a-distance-from-herschel-walker-what-does-that-mean-for-walkers-senate-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly distancing himself</a> from the Senate hopeful in the lead-up to Election Day, the governor, who is <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-2022-elections-in-georgia-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely popular</a> in Georgia, has since become more vocal <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/herschel-walker-gets-major-boost/ar-AA14wFiQ?li=BBnb7Kz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about his support for Walker</a>. According to various reports, Kemp is also lending <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/10/mcconnell-kemp-herschel-walker-georgia-runoff-00066382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a key part of his campaign infrastructure</a> to help Walker, which includes the governor’s door-knocking, data analytics and phone banking programs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Walker might also be able to court runoff voters by tying Warnock to President Biden, who has an <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underwater approval rating in the state</a>. Biden — like Trump — notably stayed away from Georgia in the final weeks of the election and instead headed to other battleground states. But Walker has still repeatedly tried to use Biden’s unpopularity against Warnock, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/13/georgia-senate-runoff-warnock-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assailing the senator as a rubber-stamp</a> for the White House. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And despite more tepid enthusiasm for Walker’s campaign among his base, it’s possible, too, that some Democrats could sit out this race. After all, and like we said before, control of the Senate isn’t on the line like it was last year. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The 2021 Georgia runoff was different. Next week’s election will tell us if it was an outlier — or the potential harbinger of more Democratic statewide victories to come. If <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past runoffs are any guide</a>, we’d expect there to be at least <em>some </em>dropoff in turnout. In 2021, for example, turnout was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down about 10 percent from the total votes</a> cast in November 2020, and historically that was an unusually small decline in runoff turnout. “There are fewer incentives to turn out this year than there were in 2021,” Bullock said. “So we might expect less people to show up to the polls this year.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the outcome of this race will tell us which side can better mobilize their base, even during a midterm year when control of the Senate isn’t at stake. And that could start to answer a much bigger question: Is the Peach State red enough to where we can regard recent Democratic wins as an off-chance phenomenon? Or is it now more competitive — or even purple — meaning races can swing in either party’s favor based on the circumstances and candidates?</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor of Arizona, made denying the results of the 2020 election central to her campaign this year. And while <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/kari-lake-files-elections-records-suit-after-losing-arizona-governors-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she hasn’t yet conceded</a>, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-arizona-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost that race</a> to Democrat Katie Hobbs. It was one of the most high-profile examples of a pattern we saw over and over again in the midterms: When election deniers ran for offices that have significant oversight over elections themselves, voters rejected them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There was <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/projects/democracy-ballot-arizonas-2022-midterm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot</a> of <a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/democracy-ballot-year-national-voter-registration-day-2022-more-critical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk about</a> democracy <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/why-2022-elections-might-determine-future-us-democracy-1101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being on the ballot</a> this midterm cycle, with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of candidates who refused to accept the outcome</a> of the last nationwide election. And while <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/denying-the-2020-election-wasnt-a-winning-strategy-for-political-newcomers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many of those candidates (particularly incumbents) won their races</a>, when it came to those who would have a direct impact on how elections are run and votes counted, the trend was clear. Voters chose democracy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While members of Congress obviously have a role to play — 147 Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted not to certify</a> some of the results of the 2020 election, and a handful of Democrats have <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/no-trump-electoral-college-challenge-233294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">done so in past cycles as well</a> — state-level officials hold the most immediate authority over elections. In particular, secretaries of state serve as the chief election official in most states, and overseeing elections is a big part of their job. Voters recognize this and, when state-level candidates were adamant election deniers, they not only lost, they typically did worse than other state-level candidates. </p>

 <p>Uncalled races are current as of Nov. 28, 2022, 2 p.m. Eastern.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In Pennsylvania, Republican Doug Mastriano lost the governor’s race by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-pennsylvania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 14 percentage points</a> to Democrat Josh Shapiro. The governor of the Keystone State appoints its chief election official, so this is a role with an even more direct impact on elections than in other states. Mastriano <a href="https://www.witf.org/2022/06/09/how-doug-mastriano-promoted-election-lies-between-election-day-and-january-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was one of the most hardline election deniers</a> running for office this year, and even attended the rally on Jan. 6, 2021, which later turned into the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Comparatively, Mehmet Oz, the Republican who ran for Senate in Pennsylvania, lost by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-pennsylvania-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 5 points</a>. Oz not only ran for a position that would less directly impact elections in the state, but he also didn’t make the 2020 election central to his campaign — he never said it was stolen from Trump, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/25/dr-oz-pennsylvania-debate-trump-00027712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">though he did question the results</a> at times. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Arizona, though Lake lost by less than 1 percentage point, the Republican candidate for secretary of state, Mark Finchem, performed much worse, losing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-arizona-secretary-of-state.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by nearly 5 points</a>. Like Lake, Finchem equally embraced Trump’s baseless election fraud claims, but unlike Lake, he was running for a position where overseeing elections is arguably the most important part of the job (no shade to <a href="https://azsos.gov/about-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping records</a> and administering the <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/ucc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniform</a> <a href="https://azsos.gov/business/uniform-commercial-code-ucc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commercial</a> <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/ucc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code</a>, but, let’s be honest). Blake Masters, the Republican candidate for Senate, also lost by about 5 points. He, too, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-03/trump-backs-arizona-candidate-who-echoes-2020-lies" target="_blank">ran on false claims</a> during the primary that Trump won in 2020 and that big tech and the media “conspired” to rig the election — though he later <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/07/masters-kelly-arizona-debate/" target="_blank">softened his stance</a> ahead of the general election. However, in another statewide race, the Republican comfortably won by a wide margin. Kimberly Yee won reelection for the state treasurer, a role that has no direct impact on elections, by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-arizona-treasurer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 11 points</a>. This is another example of voters in Arizona not simply turning against the GOP this election cycle, but specifically rejecting certain candidates running for particular offices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">New Hampshire provides a similarly apt comparison of statewide races. Like Masters, the Republican candidate for Senate, Don Bolduc, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/28/us/politics/don-buldoc-new-hampshire.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally campaigned on the false claim</a> that Trump was the rightful winner in 2020 before <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-hampshires-bolduc-backtracks-statements-2020-election-stolen-ahead-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later pivoting to say</a> the election was not, in fact, stolen. Bolduc <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-new-hampshire-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost his race by more than 9 points</a>, while Republican Gov. Chris Sununu — who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/26/sununu-bucks-trump-in-2024-00027612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected Trump’s claims from the get-go</a> — won reelection by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-new-hampshire-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 15 points</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finchem, Mastriano, and Lake were part of a group of 17 primary candidates endorsed by the America First Secretary of State Coalition, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-is-backing-these-secretary-of-state-candidates-in-2024-master-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an organization run by a QAnon-supporting influencer</a> that aimed to get election deniers elected to key positions like secretary of state. Of those 17 candidates, only one — Republican candidate for Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales — prevailed (many of the candidates lost during the primary elections). And despite getting the seal of approval from this group, <a href="https://www.ibj.com/articles/hot-race-for-secretary-of-state-to-enliven-gop-state-convention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morales has said that 2020</a> was “obviously” a “legitimate election.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are still a lot of reasons to be concerned about the state of democracy in America — 2021 <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/voting-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought a massive wave</a> of new voter restrictions, a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-political-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disturbingly high share of Americans</a> think political violence is justified, and <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/moore-v-harper-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pending court cases</a> could severely limit efforts to curtail gerrymandering or restrictive election laws. But over and over again this fall, voters in this country made it clear that, given the choice, they’re still picking democracy. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into the 2022 election, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fewer-americans-are-likely-to-vote-for-a-republican-governor-and-a-democratic-senator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one big question</a> was just how many voters would be willing to vote for one party’s candidate for U.S. Senate and the opposing party’s candidate for governor. We’ve known <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for a while</a> that this voting behavior, known as “<a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/split-ticket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split-ticket</a>” voting, has been on the decline in U.S. elections, thanks to forces such as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarization</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative partisanship</a> that influence voters to consistently back one party. But while FiveThirtyEight’s forecast projected a further downtick in split-ticket voting this year, we didn’t know just how things would play out from state to state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With most results in now, we can safely say that split-ticket voting decreased in 2022 — for the most part. And yet, the few voters who did split their tickets mattered a lot for the outcomes in many states, especially where one party won the Senate race and the other party won the governorship.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, we were able to look at 25 pairs of Senate and gubernatorial elections in 24 of the 26 states with such pairs on the ballot in 2022.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of a special election, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/oklahoma-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92010386" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; had two Senate races with its single gubernatorial election, so we actually have 25 cases as we compare Oklahoma’s governor’s race to each Senate contest. We excluded &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/alaska-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92009734" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/idaho-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92009817" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; from this analysis: Alaska because multiple candidates from the same party ran in the Senate race, and a high-profile independent, former Gov. Bill Walker, ran in the state’s gubernatorial contest; and Idaho because fewer than 90 percent of voters in Idaho backed a Democrat or Republican for governor, making a comparison between the margins in the state’s Senate and gubernatorial races less meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>15</sup></a> Of those, five states elected senators and governors from different parties, with one more — Georgia — possibly joining them, depending on the outcome of a Dec. 6 runoff election. A few states saw sizable differences, especially deep-blue Vermont, where popular Republican Gov. Phil Scott won reelection by a whopping 47 percentage points, while in the Senate contest, Democratic Rep. Peter Welch won by a massive 40 points. But Vermont’s 87-point spread was a clear outlier: Only eight of the other 24 pairs of races had double-digit differences, including three of the five pairings that saw candidates from different parties elected. Broadly speaking, there wasn’t <em>that </em>much variation in many states, as the median difference was 7.8 points, found in New York, which ranked as the smallest in any midterm dating back to 1990.</p>

 <p>Includes races where one Democrat and one Republican ran and excludes races where third-party candidates won at least 10 percent of the vote. Because of a special election, Oklahoma had two Senate elections, so we compared each to the state’s single governor’s race. Margins as of Nov. 28.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Still, split-ticket voters wielded significant power — even if they weren’t sizable in number — especially in three closely fought states. Most striking was Nevada, where Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto won reelection by only about 1 point while Republican Joe Lombardo bested Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak by a little over 1 point at the same time. Similarly, the handful of Wisconsin voters who backed both Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers helped both win narrow reelection victories. And while Georgia’s Senate race is headed for a runoff, that happened partly because a small group of voters who backed Republican Gov. Brian Kemp also voted for Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in the latter’s race against Republican Herschel Walker. That kept Walker below 50 percent and gave Warnock about a 1-point edge, although he too fell short of a majority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, a few states besides Vermont had fairly sizable differences that highlighted how the parties split the two races — or at the very least how one race was far more competitive than the other. New Hampshire reelected Republican Gov. Chris Sununu by 15 points while simultaneously giving Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan another six-year term by 9 points. In Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly overcame the state’s strong GOP lean to win reelection by about 2 points even as Republican Sen. Jerry Moran handily won by 23 points. And while candidates from the same party won both races in Hawaii, Ohio and Oregon, each state saw a comfortable win for an incumbent in one contest while the open-seat election for the other office was much more competitive. That these incumbents would win more easily isn’t terribly surprising, as they tend to gain <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least some advantage</a> from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379418301379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already holding office</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All in all, though, the results in these Senate and gubernatorial contests suggest that split-ticket voting has continued to decline. The median difference of about 8 points proved to be a new low in Senate-governor results in midterm elections from 1990 to 2022, as the chart below shows:</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Voters were less likely to vote for different parties this year" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DrOSO/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="471" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even with the diminished rate of split-ticket voting, about a quarter of the Senate-governor pairs we looked at had split-ticket outcomes. That share was roughly in line with midterms dating back to 2010, when between about 1-in-6 and 1-in-4 states saw different parties win their Senate and governor contests. In other words, split-ticket voting isn’t so rare — at least today, anyway — that the actual governing outcomes of these votes produce <em>no</em> split results.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s not hard to imagine us moving further in that direction in the years to come. In 2020, just one state (Maine) <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/08/once-again-nearly-all-senate-elections-reflect-states-presidential-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for different parties</a> for president and Senate, while no state in 2016 produced a split-ticket result in those two races. It’s true that midterms may remain more inclined to lead to split-ticket outcomes between top-tier races like governor and Senate because elections for governor <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still aren’t as nationalized</a> as races for federal office. That has led some voters to back a party they don’t normally support in elections for a state’s chief executive. But even then, we’re seeing increasingly nationalized gubernatorial elections, which could further reduce the rate of split-ticket voting in midterm years, too.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>The 2022 midterms just ended a couple weeks ago,<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/runoffs-are-sort-of-georgias-thing-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not in Georgia&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> but the 2024 election has already begun: Just a week after Election Day, former President Donald Trump announced he would <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-2024-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run for president again</a>. Given how little of a break we’re getting between the two campaigns, it raises the question: How could the results of the 2022 election influence the results of 2024’s?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To answer that, I’ve convened a meeting of FiveThirtyEight’s brightest political minds. How’s everyone feeling about the campaign whiplash??</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>The <a href="https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0227.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent campaign</a> is more permanent than ever.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter):<strong> </strong>Haha, our jobs are never boring — that’s for sure! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/kaleigh-rogers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleigh Rogers</a>, technology and politics reporter):<strong> </strong>People often comment that my job is only busy every other year and I laugh and laugh.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/monica-potts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monica Potts</a>, senior politics reporter):<strong> </strong>It seemed like Trump was forever promising an announcement “tomorrow,” so by the time it happened it felt like it had already happened. But yes, it is a never-ending campaign season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, let’s get one thing out of the way. Democrats had a surprisingly strong showing in 2022, especially by historical standards: They <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-blue-nevada-means-democrats-will-keep-control-of-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the Senate</a>, and they lost <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-control-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer than 10 seats in the House</a> despite the president’s party losing over <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two dozen House seats</a> in the typical midterm. Is this reason for Democrats to be optimistic about 2024 as well?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m hesitant to make sweeping generalizations about 2024 based off Democrats’ performance in 2022. Sure, Democratic victories give President Biden something to brag about in the meantime, but historically, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/09/2022-2024-midterms-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we haven’t been able to predict presidential results based on midterm elections</a>. And I don’t see why this year would be the exception.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I mean, they might take it as a reason to be optimistic. But as Alex said, historically, there’s been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stop-using-the-midterms-to-predict-presidential-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little relationship between the result in a midterm election and the result of the next presidential contest</a>. So what happened in November 2022 probably has little bearing on how November 2024 will pan out, at least in terms of votes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that’s understandable: We don’t know who the candidates will be in 2024, we don’t know what the political environment will be like and the electorate will be different! Right now, the U.S. Election Project’s preliminary turnout figure for this year is around <a href="https://www.electproject.org/2022g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 percent of the voting-eligible population</a>. With California still counting a lot of ballots, that’ll probably hit 47 percent. But in 2020, almost <a href="https://www.electproject.org/2020g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67 percent of the VEP</a> cast a ballot for president! So a lot of people who didn’t participate in 2022 will probably participate in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>Yeah, I mean midterms generally have very little correlation with presidential elections. In addition to the changes in the electorate, people just think differently about voting for president compared to voting for governor or senator. It’s the highest office, and so much depends on what happens in the months leading up to the actual election. I wouldn’t use the midterms to make any predictions about 2024, personally, other than perhaps who else might run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Two of the biggest issues motivating voters this year seemed to be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ipsos-preelection-survey-likely-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation/the economy</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-was-always-going-to-impact-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion rights</a>, and it’s just so hard to say what conditions will be like in two years. I can see red states continuing to push abortion bans or enforce the ones that already exist, but I can also see purple states moderating and blue states working to protect abortion rights. Who knows what the economy will do, but I think it’s safe to say it won’t be in the same place. I think so much depends on those conditions, who’s at the top of the tickets and what happens in the swing states where Democrats won this year, like Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>And the issues that motivated voters this fall could be way different than the issues that motivate voters in presidential election years. You might also see, for example, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-ap-top-news-politics-pa-state-wire-d55cc54be76c680219cbff477deec40e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic backlash</a> toward Trump if he ends up being the GOP’s presidential nominee, similar to what we saw in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Great points all!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yeah, for every midterm-presidential pairing like 2018-20 (when Democrats had a great midterm and then defeated Trump), there’s one like 2010-12 (when Republicans had a great midterm and then failed to unseat then-President Barack Obama).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Seriously, Nathaniel. Speaking of whiplash, one of the best examples is 1946-48, when Republicans <a href="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1901-1950/The-1946-House-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swamped Democrats</a> in the 1946 midterms to take back the Senate and House, but then former President Harry Truman <a href="https://www.history.com/news/dewey-defeats-truman-election-headline-gaffe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprised by winning reelection</a> in 1948, bringing with him <a href="https://history.house.gov/Congressional-Overview/Profiles/81st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweeping majorities</a> for Democrats in the Senate and House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>In fairness, though, 2022 is a different case — the rare example of a midterm where the president’s party did relatively well. What has happened in presidential elections after those midterms?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>Ooh, that’s a good question … for Geoff!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">(My brain holds very different esoteric knowledge.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Nathaniel, a couple examples that come to mind are 1970-72 and 1998-2000. In 1970, Republicans actually gained a seat in the Senate and lost only nine seats in the House, but Democrats retained clear majorities in both chambers. Then in 1972, then-President Richard Nixon won one of the <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1972&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatest landslide reelections</a> in U.S. history. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 1998, Democrats gained five seats in the House and preserved the status quo in the Senate amid a backlash over GOP attempts to impeach then-President Bill Clinton, but then Republican George W. Bush captured the White House in 2000. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Obviously these are two fairly different circumstances when it comes to an incumbent president running or not, which candidates were running (George McGovern was not the strongest contender for Democrats in ’72), and the events surrounding the election. But that speaks to how hard it is to know what’ll happen next! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, and there’s also 2002-04, when Republicans had a good midterm in the wake of Sept. 11 and then Bush won a narrow reelection. But of course, we’re dealing with a very small sample size here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kaleigh, you mentioned that the midterms could influence who jumps into the race for president. Do you guys think the midterms change Biden’s reelection calculus at all?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>I don’t know about change, but certainly influence. Biden has a lot of factors to consider and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/10/joe-biden-2024-president-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> he was going to discuss with family over the holidays. But he’s got to be feeling emboldened after such a strong showing in the midterms. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another influential factor has to be Trump’s announcement. Biden won against Trump once before, so there’s this underlying narrative of “he beat him once, he could beat him again,” if Trump wins the nomination. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>If Democrats had succumbed to the midterm curse that’s typical for the party in the White House, Biden may have faced <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/cnn-poll-biden-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsized pressure</a> to not run in 2024 (as he did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/us/politics/biden-2024-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before the midterms</a>). But I think, to Kaleigh’s point, you could make the argument that the results of this year’s races, coupled with Trump’s presidential announcement, clear up any doubts over whether Biden is running for reelection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Kaleigh, I think that’s right. I’ve said before that Biden’s chances of running again depended in part on whether Trump would run again, and now Trump is running. So I do think Biden may be somewhat more likely to run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, it’s also possible that Biden could decide this is a moment where the Democratic bench of potential candidates is stronger after the success of many big names in the midterms, especially governors of potentially competitive states like Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan or Jared Polis of Colorado.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>I still think it’s worth remembering that Biden remains pretty unpopular (his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating</a> is currently below 42 percent), and voters chose their Democratic candidates in House and Senate races for many reasons. I think it would be reading too much into the results to say it boosts Biden’s chances. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Geoffrey, that’s a great point about Whitmer and Polis. Both have been <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2022/11/15/after-whitmer-scores-a-big-win-speculation-about-a-future-presidential-run-ramps-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked about</a> as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/14/democrat-jared-polis-presidential-potential-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future presidential contenders</a>, and both absolutely crushed it in their reelection bids: Whitmer won by 11 percentage points, and Polis won by 19! I don’t think they would ever primary Biden, but if Biden <em>doesn’t</em> run, their theories of the case seem stronger than ever, especially if Democratic primary voters are concerned about electability again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Do we really think Whitmer or Polis stands a chance against Trump, though?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I think winning statewide office is one thing, but winning a presidential election against Trump is another story entirely. Biden already proved that he can beat him in 2020 and can campaign on Democrats’ success during the midterm elections, so I don’t see why he wouldn’t be seen as the strongest Democratic presidential contender (at least at this point in time). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if Whitmer thought Biden was a particularly weak president, she wouldn’t have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/michigan-governor-race-2022-midterm-elections-a91578081bc2141151efdf74bb4b3ccb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned with him</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Right, I think the really big question for Democrats is who should they nominate if not Biden? A rising star like Whitmer could be risky. Voters don’t really have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable opinion of Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, for lots of reasons that include sexism and racism, but she hasn’t been a super visible VP. I’m having flashbacks to the crowded Democratic field in the 2020 presidential election, which didn’t have a clear favorite until House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jim-clyburn-changed-everything-for-joe-bidens-campaign-hes-been-a-political-force-for-a-long-time/2020/03/30/7d054e98-6d33-11ea-aa80-c2470c6b2034_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Biden</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>I think Whitmer or Polis could absolutely beat Trump. I think a lot of Biden’s win in 2020 was simply based on him being the “not Trump” candidate. Trump is basically <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just as unpopular</a> now as he was before the 2020 election, and even some of his <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/republicans-explain-why-theyre-cooling-on-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporters are saying they don’t want him to run</a>. There are many capable Democrats who could fill the “not Trump” role and defeat him in 2024 if Biden were to opt against running.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>As Nathaniel said, I don’t think these candidates run if Biden does. But if he doesn’t seek reelection, they’d certainly have a decent shot of defeating Trump in a general election. For one thing, both Whitmer and Polis have put together impressive electoral track records in states that are either real swingy or at least not deep blue. Whitmer could make abortion a major issue, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/09/gretchen-whitmer-profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as she did in her reelection campaign</a>, while Polis has a <a href="https://reason.com/2022/11/10/jared-polis-success-shows-that-democrats-can-win-without-embracing-big-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit of a libertarian streak</a> in him that could expand his appeal in a general election context. Plus, Trump is one of the great unifiers in history — for Democrats, anyway. So that would help the eventual Democratic nominee to some extent. Moreover, the country is starkly divided and close presidential elections are just sort of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-biden-blowout-didnt-happen-and-why-a-2024-blowout-is-unlikely-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a matter of course these days</a>, so barring a real catastrophe for one party, we should expect another highly competitive contest in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Yes, I think so much depends on whether Trump is the nominee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m not totally convinced by the “not Trump” argument, Kaleigh. I think most of the Democratic field in 2020 campaigned on being the “<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/09/28/beto-orourke-calls-donald-trumps-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not Trump</a>” or “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pete-buttigieg-says-he-can-beat-donald-trump-in-2020/2019/04/14/ea22a7b8-5e5d-11e9-9625-01d48d50ef75_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m best positioned to beat Trump</a>” candidate. But there’s a reason why Biden was the victor in the end.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But I largely agree with your point, Geoff. I think Biden running will stop other Democrats from jumping in, so there’s not a split Democratic field. The flip side, though, is that I don’t think a Trump announcement will stop other prominent <em>Republicans</em> from throwing their hat in the ring.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3b5.png" alt="🎵"> </strong>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POfxpMqIgRE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">name on everybody’s lips</a> is gonna be … Ronny! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3b5.png" alt="🎵"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Haha, indeed, Kaleigh. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was another governor who turned in a really impressive reelection performance earlier this month. He won by 19 points in a state that, until recently at least, was considered the quintessential swing state! Do we think this strengthens his hand ahead of his widely expected presidential bid?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>That’s a good point, Nathaniel! With his landslide election in Florida, DeSantis was easily the biggest GOP storyline to come out of the 2022 election. I won’t cite exit poll data directly, but <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/florida-latinos-turned-favor-republicans-rcna57167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting suggests</a> that he performed well with Latino voters and <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/massive-desantis-rubio-wins-have-florida-and-miami-dade-seeing-red/2904788/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipped Miami-Dade County</a>, which is historically Democratic. I think his performance this year might convince Republicans that he’s the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/16/desantis-trump-2024-election-00067834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest alternative to Trump</a> — if they’re looking for one. Plus, DeSantis has long been viewed as a rising star within the GOP, so it’s not beyond the realm of possibility that he takes on the challenge.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>There’s no doubt: The results in Florida solidified DeSantis’s role as a popular Republican rising star, and at least some polls are now showing him ahead of Trump. An <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/11/16/republicans-prefer-ron-desantis-to-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted just after the election found 46 percent of Republicans said they’d prefer to see DeSantis as the GOP nominee in 2024, compared to 39 percent who said they’d prefer Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while a majority — 60 percent — of Republicans said they wanted to see Trump run in 2024 when asked before the election, just 47 percent did when asked after the election (but before Trump announced his candidacy).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I’d be careful about those polls, though, Kaleigh. We often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/13-tips-for-reading-general-election-polls-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warn people</a> to wait a while to interpret polls after major news events like debates, and the midterms definitely qualify.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>That’s true! We’ll have to wait to see if any of these turn into actual trends.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>I can absolutely see Republican party leaders coalescing around DeSantis because they know Trump motivates Democrats to vote against them. DeSantis’s policies and positions are very similar to Trump’s, and he plays to the base on issues like immigration, education and voter fraud (which, as we know, is <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ap-review-finds-far-too-little-vote-fraud-to-tip-2020-election-to-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a significant concern</a>). Republican voters seem to like him — even before the midterms, 64 percent of registered Republican voters told <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/11/09164530/2211022_crosstabs_MC_WASHINGTON_RVs_STACKED_v3_CC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> they had a favorable opinion of him. And this is anecdotal, but Republican voters where I live seem to know who he is and also like him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2016, Trump didn’t really have any opponents who could get enough support to really challenge him. Many voters thought of him as a businessman and what he would do as a politician was unknown. Now he’s a known quantity, his successful run is six years in the past and there are alternatives like DeSantis. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>DeSantis might be in a position to make himself almost a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-desantis-is-a-major-threat-to-trumps-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-favorite</a>, assuming he does what everyone expects and runs. Granted, Trump has been ahead in pretty much all national polls that aren’t testing him and DeSantis head-to-head. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Trump has led early polls, but DeSantis has been creeping up" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9Daie/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="424" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">And remember, if other candidates get into the field, they won’t be going mano-a-mano, at least not initially. The size of the eventual field is not a minor consideration either, considering Trump won with just a plurality in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2" target="_blank">2016 Republican presidential primary</a>. It remains to be seen if the many <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/business/trump-donors-schwarzman-griffin.html" target="_blank">bigwig donors</a> and influencers within the GOP who oppose Trump will rally behind one candidate or not. And it's not like Trump had their backing early in 2016, so even if they are unified, that isn't certain to stop him either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Trump has not emerged from the midterms covered in glory, though. Many of the candidates he endorsed in the primary lost the general election; in fact, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/upshot/trump-effect-midterm-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/15/data-trump-weighed-down-republican-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a> both calculated they performed 5 points worse than expected. And his intervention may have directly cost the GOP multiple seats. For example, he <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/trump-endorses-joe-kent-republican-challenger-to-rep-jaime-herrera-beutler-who-voted-for-impeachment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed far-right Republican Joe Kent</a> in the primary for Washington’s 3rd District over incumbent Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler because Herrera Beutler voted to impeach him. Kent won the primary but ended up losing the general election — which was a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/washington/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big shock</a>, because this seat is pretty red. Now, many Republican elites are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/us/politics/trump-republicans-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grumbling about him costing the party seats</a>, or at least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/trump-republicans-move-on-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not embracing his presidential campaign</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, recent history is littered with examples of Republicans appearing to break with Trump, only to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/06/nikki-haley-biggest-gop-flip-flops-trump-post-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall back in line later</a>. Do you guys think that will happen again, or is this time really different?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I tend to see this as half a 2016 circumstance, if you will. Many party elites <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/battleground-republicans-unload-trump-ahead-expected-2024-announcement-rcna57153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t want to get behind Trump</a> and will look to DeSantis as a principal alternative. But depending on the contours of the GOP presidential primary, they could definitely come flooding back to Trump if DeSantis struggles against him for some reason. And Trump will start out with far more institutional support than he had previously. You already see various Republicans announcing their support for him, like <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dont-blame-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen.-elect J.D. Vance</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Agreed, Geoff. I think if voters largely continue to back Trump, it’ll be hard for the party to step in and knock him down. To be honest, Trumpism is so ingrained within the GOP today that I almost forgot about all the intraparty grumbling during his 2016 run! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Yes, this is tricky because people underestimated Trump in 2016 and then kept declaring his campaign over — but it never was. But I do think this time is really different. Jan. 6 was a real turning point people haven’t forgotten. And as Kaleigh has written, the election denial that drove the insurrection <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/denying-the-2020-election-wasnt-a-winning-strategy-for-political-newcomers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not win seats for Republican newcomers this cycle</a>. Voters often have short memories, but I think voters remember that and want to move away from that. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Monica, I think Jan. 6 might make Trump a weaker general election nominee, but how much it hurts him in the presidential primary on the GOP side is less clear. After all, for months, even years now, a consistent 60-ish percent of Republicans have said in polling that Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/poll-61-republicans-still-believe-biden-didnt-win-fair-square-2020-rcna49630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t legitimately win the 2020 election</a>. If Trump didn’t lose in their eyes, they’re not necessarily going to view him as weaker.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Monica Potts: </strong>Geoffrey, that’s fair. I just wonder how much this year’s midterms quieted down those beliefs. I was prepared to see losing candidates claiming election fraud or refusing to concede, and that didn’t really happen. I just wonder if the midterm results might weaken those beliefs in all but the true believers, as voters move on to other issues.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>There are Republican voters who love Trump but fear he can’t win, and they want the White House more than they want Trump to be the nominee. The question is how big of a contingent those voters are.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Election Day is finally upon us, and we’re “right back where we started from,” to borrow a phrase from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckCwBAhz4oc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maxine Nightingale</a>. FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deluxe forecast for the U.S. House</a>, which is now final and no longer updating, estimates that Republicans have an 84-in-100 chance of taking control of the chamber. That’s roughly the same chance Republicans had when we launched our midterm forecast on June 30.</p>

The president’s party has lost an average of 26 House seats in midterm elections since the end of World War II. <br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn Roe v. Wade</a>, the national mood seemed to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shift in the Democrats’ favor</a>. Democrats retook the lead in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> polls (which ask Americans to pick the party they plan to support for Congress without asking about specific candidates). And their chances of keeping the House in our forecast rose as high as 32-in-100 — enough to make Republicans sweat.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2396" height="1342" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.22.39-AM-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.22.39-AM-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.22.39-AM-1.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.22.39-AM-1.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Then in October, the national political mood <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned back against the president’s party</a>, as it usually does in the final month of a midterm campaign. As a result, our final average of generic congressional ballot polls shows Republicans getting 46.9 percent support nationally and Democrats getting 45.7 percent. Still, that is not as big of a lead as the opposition party enjoyed in the 2010 and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 midterms</a>. Democrats’ summer surge may have saved them from their doomsday scenario — a so-called “red wave” election.<br><br>Our forecast also predicts that, on average, Republicans will win 230 seats in the next House, and Democrats will win 205. That would be a 17-seat gain for Republicans, which would be below average for a midterm election. However, those seat projections come with very wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confidence intervals</a>, which means <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide range of scenarios is possible</a>. For example, our forecast says there’s an 80 percent chance that Republicans will gain between one and 33 House seats.</p>

 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans have a greater than 90-in-100 chance of capturing 10 of these seats, primarily because <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional redistricting</a> made these seats easy targets for the party. For example, Republican mapmakers redrew the Georgia 6th and Tennessee 5th districts to be 25 and 32 percentage points redder, respectively. And <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extreme-bias-of-floridas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida’s new congressional map</a> converted three Democratic-held districts — the 5th,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida’s new 4th District constitutes much of the state’s former 5th District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> 7th and 13th — into Republican strongholds. Population growth also led to the creation of four new districts (the Colorado 8th, Florida 15th, Montana 1st and Texas 38th) that will probably go red.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-favored-final-midterm-forecasts-fivethirtyeight-92819264</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">There are also a lot of open seats on this list where Democratic incumbents aren’t running for reelection. The electoral advantage of incumbency <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/681670?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t what it once was</a>, but it can <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still matter in a close race</a>. So <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-democrats-are-leaving-the-house-and-that-could-help-republicans-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Democrats retiring from the House than Republicans</a> is another boon to the GOP. For example, Democrats are in danger of losing the Wisconsin 3rd without moderate Rep. Ron Kind, and the Rhode Island 2nd likely wouldn’t even be competitive if Rep. Jim Langevin were running again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, several Democratic incumbents are vulnerable too, especially those in districts <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/trump-district-democrats-could-become-extinct-in-the-house-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried by former President Donald Trump</a> in the 2020 election. Reps. Tom O’Halleran, Cindy Axne and Mary Peltola may struggle to find enough crossover voters to survive. Reps. Matt Cartwright and Jared Golden are in a better position but are not out of the woods.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In total, there are 19 non-Republican-held House seats where Republicans have better odds of winning than Democrats,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some are essentially toss-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> including six where Republicans have at least a 97-in-100 chance of winning. So why are Republicans’ chances of winning the House only 84-in-100? Well, because Democrats could also flip some seats from red to blue. Here is a list of every House seat that <em>Democrats</em> have a greater than 25 percent chance to pick up,<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counting both Republican-held seats and new seats created by redistricting that don’t have an incumbent party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast.</p>

 <p>*Two incumbents are running in the Texas 34th: Republican Mayra Flores and Democrat Vicente Gonzalez. However, because Gonzalez currently represents the next-door 15th District, Flores is listed as the incumbent.</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting also helped Democrats a bit in the House. The North Carolina 14th, Oregon 6th and Texas 35th are new districts created by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reapportionment</a>. And Democratic mapmakers reconfigured the Republican-held Illinois 13th to elect a Democrat. And then, there are a couple of Republican incumbents whose seats are now blue enough that they should watch their back: For instance, President Biden won California’s new 22nd and 27th by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double digits</a>. Overall, though, Democrats have fewer opportunities to add members than Republicans do, which essentially tells the story of this election.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">What’s that? Do you still insist on staying up late on Tuesday to follow the results, just in case something unexpected happens? In that case, I have two recommendations. The first is to pay particular attention to the 25 House districts below. According to our forecast, they are the 25 most likely <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-tipping-point-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“tipping-point” seats</a>, or the seats most likely to decide control of the chamber. As these seats go, so goes the House.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">With all the hubbub over the horse race, it might have been easy to forget that there are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/36-states-are-electing-governors-this-year-here-are-the-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36 governors’ races</a> taking place tonight, too. But the results of these contests may have a greater impact on everyday Americans’ day-to-day lives than congressional races as state chief executives have an outsized influence on state-level policy issues like health care, education, tax policy and more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since 2010, Republicans have held a majority of governorships. In fact, the GOP currently holds 28 governor’s seats, while the Democrats control 22. That said, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a>, which is now frozen, indicates that Republicans and Democrats are each poised for a few pickups.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s run through some of the main trends and states that we’ll be watching — starting with the most contentious seats, and ending with the least suspenseful races. Shall we begin?</p>



<h2><strong>There are a bunch of competitive races …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ll start with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kansas</strong></a>, where the Democratic incumbent has an edge. Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, is running for another term in office, but only has a 62-in-100 chance of winning against Republican Derek Schmidt. Unlike a few other races we’ll cover further down, though, the competitiveness of this contest isn’t <em>that </em>mysterious: <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Kansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas is just a red state</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-favored-final-midterm-forecasts-fivethirtyeight-92819264</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Our model still leans toward Kelly, though, in part, because she’s a relatively popular incumbent. <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/kansas-2022-governor-laura-kelly-holds-three-point-lead-over-ag-derek-schmidt-in-gubernatorial-election-senator-moran-leads-by-21-points-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One recent survey</a> pegged her favorability at 53 percent among Kansas voters — 20 percentage points above President Biden’s. On top of that, Kelly has <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article268176872.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked to appeal to a broad swath</a> of voters by promoting issues that are important to Kansas Republicans, like education and the economy, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-kansass-democratic-governor-isnt-talking-about-abortion-but-her-gop-opponent-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather than</a> focusing on more polarizing topics like abortion. If Schmidt is able to overcome Kelly’s incumbency and popularity advantage, it’ll likely be both due to the <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Kansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state’s past voting history</a>, coupled with the fact that Schmidt (who is <a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/kansas-governor-race-laura-kelly-derek-schmidt-election-what-to-know-results/41822237#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed by former President Donald Trump</a>) took more conservative stances in a midterm year where there’s deep dissatisfaction with Democrats at the national level. In short, a favorable midterm environment might be enough to pull him over the finish line.</p>

That’s the case, at least, for both <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Arizona</strong></a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Alaska</strong></a> (but other parties running in these states still stand a chance, too, so we won’t count them out). Both states currently have Republican governors, so it might not be all<em> that </em>surprising that our metrics suggest that the GOP will remain in control.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Arizona, Republican Kari Lake has a 68-in-100 chance of winning. As I mentioned at the top, governors wield a lot of power in their respective states, so it might be striking to some of our readers that Lake — who has been <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/16/arizona-kari-lake-midterm-election-denial-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the leading proponents</a> of the baseless idea that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump — has an edge over Democrat Katie Hobbs. A couple of factors could be contributing to that,<strong> </strong>though, such as the fact that Lake <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/politics/kari-lake-arizona-governor-swing-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/16/kari-lake-arizona-election-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the news</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/arizona-kari-lake-false-fraud-claims-2020-election-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot lately</a> and enjoys high name recognition <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/us/politics/kari-lake-az-journalist-gop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to over two decades</a> as a local TV newscaster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><br>Of course, Hobbs <em>could</em> pull ahead. While she’s still an underdog, at least by our metrics, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-kelly-opinion-poll-arizona-senate-economy-abortion-immigration-2022-10-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one September-October survey</a> showed that just over half the state’s registered voters (51 percent) classified Lake’s views as “extreme.” And, as my colleagues and I discussed last month, it’s also entirely possible that our forecast for this seat is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-tried-to-outguess-the-fivethirtyeight-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too good for Republicans</a> — meaning the race is closer than it appears.</p>

Mike Dunleavy in Alaska has a larger edge: an 87-in-100 chance of winning. On Tuesday, the incumbent will share a ballot with independent Bill Walker, Democrat Les Gara and Republican Charlie Pierce. Alaska’s new <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/RCV.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting system</a>, however, makes this race slightly harder to gauge. Under the system — which was first deployed during <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an August congressional special election won</a> by Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola — voters are given the choice to rank who they want to fill a particular seat. And in recent months, Walker and Gara’s teams <a href="https://www.newsminer.com/news/politics/bill-walker-les-gara-campaigns-team-up-to-compete-for-second-choice-votes/article_9101cbea-5969-11ed-8514-7fd00772b5ad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have paired up to</a> both encourage Pierce to <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/10/26/walker-and-gara-call-on-pierce-to-drop-out-of-governors-race-dunleavy-says-hes-waiting-for-more-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop out of the race</a> and to <a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2022/10/20/dunleavy-defends-record-against-gara-and-walker-attacks-in-rapid-fire-alaska-debate-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally against Dunleavy</a>, telling voters that they were relying on the other’s second-place votes to win. If the gambit works, it could have an outsized influence on the race: Together, Walker and Gara made up more than <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22PRIM/ElectionSummaryReportRPT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent of the primary election vote</a>. Still, with Dunleavy <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading by significant margins</a> in recent polls, it makes sense why our model still favors a Republican victory here.</p>

In fact, there are at least three seats in which Democrats are at risk of losing control of the governorship in their respective states. <br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Nevada</strong></a>, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/11/whitmers-approval-ticks-up-in-michigan-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively popular</a> Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak is nevertheless in danger of losing his reelection bid to Republican Joe Lombardo. As of Tuesday morning, our forecast gives the Republican a 61-in-100 chance of winning. Lombardo, who has <a href="https://thenevadaglobe.com/fl/heller-and-lombardo-rise-to-the-top-of-the-polls-with-republican-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted to balance</a> the demands of his party’s more moderate and extremist wings, has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led by single digits in most recent polls</a>. This contest will be one to keep a close eye on as it could push the state firmly to the right <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/state-government-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if Republicans also win control of the state legislature</a> (which is possible, but unlikely). To aid their party, however, Democratic heavyweights like former President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/11/02/obama-stumps-democrats-catherine-cortez-masto-governor-steve-sisolak-las-vegas-election-2022/8240376001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have visited Nevada</a>, arguing that “democracy is on the ballot.” But in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-nevada-polls-are-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transient state like Nevada</a>, where the share of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/us/politics/nevada-midterms-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered Democrats has decreased</a>, it’s very possible that Republicans will perform well here in a favorable midterm year. Plus, Nevada <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t reliably blue</a>: Biden only won the state by <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little over 2 percentage points</a> in 2020.</p>

Tony Evers must contend with both <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/analysis/2022/05/26/wisconsin-governor-tony-evers-trying-get-past-joe-biden-low-ratings/9927472002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s unpopularity</a> in the state and his <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/madison/politics/2022/09/19/how-favorably-do-wisconsinites-find-the-candidates-on-their-ballot-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own lackluster approval ratings</a>. Our forecast looks at this race as essentially a pure toss-up between Evers and Republican Tim Michels, who currently has a 53-in-100 chance of unseating the incumbent. Perhaps ominously for Democrats, though, the state’s gubernatorial races have historically gone with the midterm flow: Republicans won them in 2010 and 2014, and Democrats won in 2006 and 2018.</p>

Democratic Gov. Kate Brown <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/08/gov-kate-brown-who-cant-seek-re-election-in-2022-keeps-raising-and-spending-campaign-cash-anyway.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not eligible to run for reelection</a>, but <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/11/whitmers-approval-ticks-up-in-michigan-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her lowest-in-the-nation approval rating</a> (according to a Morning Consult report published in October) could weigh down the Democrat trying to succeed her. Republican Christine Drazan has a narrow 37-in-100 chance of beating Democrat Tina Kotek, who would become the country’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/meet-oregons-tina-kotek-hopes-americas-first-lesbian-governor-rcna30628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first openly lesbian governor</a> (a milestone she’d share with Massachusetts Democrat Maura Healey if both are victorious). And going into Election Day, Kotek has a slight edge: a 63-in-100 chance of winning. That said, this race might prove difficult for the party currently in power because Oregon isn’t a deep-blue state: Former President George W. Bush <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2000&amp;fips=41&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly won the state in 2000</a> and voters elected Republican Dennis Richardson as secretary of state in 2016, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/02/oregon-secretary-of-state-dennis-richardson-dies-of-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making him the first GOP candidate</a> to win a statewide race <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2002&amp;fips=41&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2002</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s working in Kotek’s favor is that Oregon has consistently elected Democrats to the governorship <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/oregon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the late 1980s</a>. The flip side, however, is that the Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/36-states-are-electing-governors-this-year-here-are-the-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have only won recent gubernatorial races here</a> by single-digit margins (Republicans lost by just <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=41&amp;year=2010&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.5 points in 2010</a>, <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=41&amp;year=2014&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.8 points in 2014</a> and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=41&amp;year=2018&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6.4 points</a> in 2018). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another interesting wrinkle in this race is the presence of a formidable third-party candidate on the ticket, independent Betsy Johnson. According to our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a>, Johnson has consistently netted high single-digit support — which is interesting considering the fact that few statewide races involve a truly competitive third wheel. What could work to her benefit, too, is that she’s tried to position herself more toward the middle, dinging Drazan <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/elections/drazan-pro-life-woman-aware-of-oregon-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for her anti-abortion views</a> and Kotek for trying to make Oregon “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/15/politics/oregon-governor-election-kotek-drazan-johnson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woke and broke</a>.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, while partisanship has increased over the years <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in gubernatorial races</a>, voting history still matters. And for years, there have been a handful of states where both parties have tried — and failed — at winning seats from the opposing party. A few of those are on the ballot this year, and it doesn’t look like old patterns are likely to be broken.<br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></a>, for example, Democrat Josh Shapiro is clearly favored to win (he has a 97-in-100 chance to beat Republican Doug Mastriano). While Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2010/results/pennsylvania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held the governorship there in 2010</a>, they’ve been unable to beat back Democrats in both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/pennsylvania-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/pennsylvania/governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a>, and things look bad for them in 2022. That’s in part because Mastriano is a deeply controversial candidate: He both <a href="https://www.witf.org/2021/05/28/pa-sen-doug-mastriano-unlikely-to-face-consequences-over-newly-released-jan-6-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection</a> and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/doug-mastriano-pennsylvania-election-20201205.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plotted to overturn</a> Pennsylvania’s 2020 presidential election results.</p>

Greg Abbott has a 98-in-100 chance of defeating former Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke ran for the seat <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after narrowly losing</a> the state’s 2018 Senate race to Ted Cruz. But that narrow loss, it seems, hasn’t paid off for O’Rourke’s political aspirations this year. Of course, O’Rourke, a micro-celebrity in the Lone Star State, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/07/15/texas-governor-2022-abbott-orourke-fundraising-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has broken various fundraising records</a>; polling, meanwhile, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently shows a single-digit contest</a> between the two politicians.

And despite our polling average showing a tight-ish race here, O’Rourke hasn’t outpaced Abbott in a single survey. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, there are a handful of states in which our Deluxe forecast doesn’t see a clear favorite, but the party in power still retains a significant edge. In fact, there are at least four Democratic-held seats that will likely stay blue. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>New Mexico</strong></a> is one state where the governor’s race <em>might </em>be competitive, but our forecast still tilts heavily toward the party currently in power: Democrats. To be clear, the race here looks a bit more competitive than the contests in Michigan, Minnesota and Maine (which we’ll discuss lower down), but our model still gives Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham an 84-in-100 chance of winning. Part of the reason why this contest isn’t more squarely in Grisham’s column is that voters in the state <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2022/10/10/poll-lujan-grisham-approval-rating-at-46-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are fairly lukewarm about her job performance</a>.

What seems to have the GOP on edge, though, is that Stitt <a href="https://kfor.com/news/your-local-election-hq/ok-gop-top-lawyer-fired-for-tweets-over-controversial-governor-stitt-campaign-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been plagued</a> <a href="https://freepressokc.com/stitt-scandals-piling-up-as-education-relief-fund-misuse-is-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by a number of recent scandals</a>, coupled with the fact that Democrats fielded a fairly formidable candidate in Joy Hofmeister, who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/28/1108236828/oklahoma-governor-primary-republican-democrat-stitt-hofmeister-results-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified as a Republican</a> up until last year. Democrats were recently buoyed <a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/oklahoma-governor-election-midterm-2022-joy-hofmeister-kevin-stitt-democrat-republican-independent-vote-poll-ascend-action-joe-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by an October poll</a> that gave Hofmeister a narrow edge, but Hofmeister is still a long shot given the state’s reliably red hue. And, more recently, <a href="https://www.kosu.org/politics/2022-10-31/as-polls-tighten-oklahoma-gov-kevin-stitt-to-host-rallies-with-big-gop-names" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prominent conservatives</a> like Cruz and DeSantis have weighed in on Stitt’s behalf <a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/florida-governor-ron-desantis-endorses-kevin-stitt-in-bid-for-re-election-joy-hoffmeister-oklahoma-election-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with endorsements</a> or — in Cruz’s case — <a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/sen-ted-cruz-headlines-stitt-for-governor-rally-in-oklahoma-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a trip to Oklahoma</a> to rally voters.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are the two Republican-held governorships that will likely go to Democrats: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Massachusetts</strong></a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Maryland</strong></a>. Last year, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/01/massachusetts-charlie-baker-reelection-523597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that he wouldn’t seek reelection. But Baker, a moderate Republican who <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/13/charlie-baker-massachusetts-trump-339182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defied Trump</a> during his two terms in office, likely won’t be replaced by a member of his own party — despite Massachusetts voters <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electing GOP gubernatorial candidates</a> in both 2014 and 2018. <br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Democrat Maura Healey has over a 99-in-100 chance of beating Republican Geoff Diehl. This is likely due to the fact that <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massachusetts is a very blue state</a>, and without a candidate who shares Baker’s moderatism, Republicans were always going to be underdogs. (Diehl, a former state House member, is <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/10/06/donald-trump-geoff-diehl-massachusetts-charlie-baker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed by Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/politics/trump-republicans-midterm-election-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t committed to accepting</a> the outcome of the November election.) If Healey wins, she (along with Kotek in Oregon), could make history as the country’s first <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/us-never-lesbian-governor-two-women-change-rcna52300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out lesbian</a> governor(s).</p>

Throughout the race, Moore has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/08/31/moore-cox-fundraising-maryland-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven a prolific fundraiser</a> and has led Cox by 30-point margins <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in every poll</a> in our database fielded since September. Similar to Massachusetts, this seat is most likely to flip because the state’s more moderate incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan is term-limited <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/28/maryland-general-election-ballot-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and can’t seek reelection</a>. And Cox, like Diehl, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/us/politics/dan-cox-maryland-governors-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a Trump loyalist</a> who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/20/maryland-mail-vote-counting-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has denied, without evidence</a>, the legitimacy of the 2020 election. That likely won’t bode well with the state’s voters, who elected Biden by a nearly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/maryland-president-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33-point margin</a> in 2020. If Moore wins, <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/decision-2022/wes-moore-black-democrats-aiming-to-make-maryland-history/3194744/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would make history</a>, too, as the state’s first Black governor.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Just about no part of the 2022 midterms is more uncertain than the race for control of the U.S. Senate. The chamber is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including two independents — Maine Sen. Angus King and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — who caucus with the 48 Democratic senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> but Democrats hold a precarious majority via the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. As a result, a one-seat gain by Republicans would be enough to give them control, whereas Democrats need to avoid any net losses to retain their advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the fate of the Senate looks to be on a knife’s edge. Republicans have a 59-in-100 chance of taking control of the chamber, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, which is now frozen. That isn’t much better than the probability of calling a coin-flip correctly, although the GOP may have the slightest of edges. Considering the midterm environment and the seats that are up this cycle, it’s perhaps unsurprising that Republicans have a slightly better chance than Democrats of capturing the Senate. But the GOP’s fortunes have also improved markedly in the final weeks, as Democrats had about a 7-in-10 shot of controlling the Senate in late September. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2418" height="1374" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.03.52-AM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.03.52-AM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.03.52-AM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.03.52-AM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Still, if one party does have an edge, it’s the GOP. Our forecast, which has trended toward Republicans in the final few weeks of the campaign, gives them an 80 percent chance of holding between 48 and 54 seats after this election. Our forecast predicts that, on average, Republicans will wind up with 50.9 seats — essentially 51, which would be just enough for outright control of the chamber.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if we look individually at the 35 Senate contests on the ballot,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 100-seat Senate is divided into three classes of seats that have staggered six-year terms. There are 33 seats each in &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_I.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_II.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class II&lt;/a&gt;, and 34 seats in &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_III.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class III&lt;/a&gt;, and only one of the classes is on the ballot every two years. Class III seats are up for election this year, but there is also a special election in Oklahoma for the Class II seat held by Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-special-elections-oklahoma-jim-inhofe-congress-adc9a3344b4cc339f395859913a98e79" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;resigning at the end&lt;/a&gt; of the current (117th) Congress. This makes for a total of 35 Senate elections in 2022 that will affect the makeup of the 118th Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> we can also see how Republicans are somewhat better positioned than Democrats. That’s because the GOP needs fewer things to go right on Election Day, whereas Democrats have less room for error.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This GOP advantage is most obvious in the Senate’s five most competitive seats, four of which are being defended by Democrats. To hold the Senate, Democrats at a minimum must retain all four seats they currently control, or retain three of the four <em>and </em>pick up the one seat in this group that Republicans are defending. Of the four seats Democrats are defending, one leans toward the GOP, one is a toss-up and two narrowly lean Democratic, while the GOP-held seat is also a toss-up.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And for the most part, these are among the races most likely to decide control of the Senate — that is, be the “tipping-point” contest. In light of this, the most important matchup may be in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a>. Using the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive version of the forecast,</a> giving Georgia to either party raises its chances of winning the Senate to about 3 in 4, without knowing outcomes anywhere else. The good news for the GOP is that it may have the upper hand here, as Republican Herschel Walker has a 63-in-100 chance of defeating Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. Walker’s chances have improved despite allegations that he encouraged and/or paid for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-woman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple women</a> to have abortions while campaigning on a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/14/walker-warnock-georgia-abortion-00061971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly anti-abortion platform</a>. But Walker, like most other Republican candidates, may be benefiting from the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more favorable Republican national environment</a>. Notably, this race is so close <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-if-georgias-senate-race-goes-to-a-runoff-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that there’s about a 1-in-5 chance</a> it will go to a <a href="https://www.sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/forms/2022%20State%20Scheduled%20Elections%20Short%20Calendar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dec. 6 runoff</a>, should neither candidate win an outright majority (there’s also a Libertarian on the ballot).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans’ other top pick-up opportunity is in Nevada, but that race could be a squeaker: Republican Adam Laxalt has a 51-in-100 chance of defeating Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to our forecast</a>, which suggests neither candidate really has an advantage. Still, Laxalt has about a 1-point lead in our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a>, although neither candidate <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has had an advantage</a> much beyond that margin since late September. Cortez Masto will hope that the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-nevada-presidential-election-2020-catherine-cortez-masto-522d32cfa13a1a1f9a639ee6d9707e8a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaunted electoral organization</a> built by her predecessor, the late Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, can turn out Democratic voters, but Laxalt may come out on top <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/control-of-the-senate-could-rest-on-abortion-and-inflation-in-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to frustration over inflation and the economy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other toss-up race is in Pennsylvania, but Republicans here are on the defensive following <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-all-those-gop-retirements-mean-for-the-2022-senate-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the retirement</a> of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. This seat is of critical importance, too, as our forecast interactive shows that Oz winning would give Republicans better than a 4-in-5 shot of capturing the Senate, while Democrats’ chances would improve to around 7 in 10 with a win here. Appropriately, the race is just about too close to call: Republican Mehmet Oz, a physician and TV personality, has a 57-in-100 chance of defeating Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. This race has been trending toward Oz, though, as Fetterman’s roughly 3-point lead two weeks ago has narrowed to practically a tie in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average</a>. Fetterman suffered a stroke in the spring, and coverage of its effects on his health and his ability to serve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/john-fettermans-attacks-on-health-disability-and-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been a major focus of the race</a>, but Oz has had to make up ground in this campaign because <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/11_2_2022_tables.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters tend</a> to view <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Marist-Poll_PA-NOS-and-Tables_202211030901-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">him more</a> unfavorably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/31/upshot/senate-polls-az-ga-nv-pa-crosstabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than Fetterman</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The two other highly competitive seats narrowly favor Democrats. In Arizona, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast</a> gives Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly a 66-in-100 chance of defeating Republican Blake Masters. But while Kelly may narrowly best Masters thanks to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/10/arizonas-u-s-senate-race-shifts-to-a-toss-up-as-polls-tighten-despite-massive-democratic-fundraising-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his huge spending edge</a>, the incumbent may also thank his personal appeal: Likely Arizona voters told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/31/upshot/senate-polls-az-ga-nv-pa-crosstabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siena College/The New York Times</a> in late October that they preferred GOP control to Democratic control of the Senate, but also that they preferred Kelly over Masters. In New Hampshire, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast</a> gives Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan a 72-in-100 chance of beating Republican Don Bolduc, a retired Army general whom popular New Hampshire Gov.

<p data-paragraph="main">Five other races look more likely to go for one party or the other — three in seats held by Republicans and two in seats held by Democrats — but they could also be in play depending on how the night goes for each party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, one of the country’s leading swing states, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is favored to defeat Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. Historically, incumbents from the party not in the White House <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/ron-johnson-republicans-senate-2022-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost never lose</a> in midterms, so Johnson has likely benefited from the political environment. Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sometimes-senators-just-retire-dont-read-too-much-into-the-recent-gop-exodus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are defending two open seats</a> in North Carolina and Ohio, but they also look like good bets to win each race. In red-leaning <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>, GOP Rep. Ted Budd <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/cheri-beasley-democrats-losing-streak-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks to have the upper hand</a> over Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. And while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> has looked competitive <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for much of this cycle</a>, Republican J.D. Vance looks likely to defeat Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, as Vance has consolidated support among Republicans in a state that is redder than North Carolina and Wisconsin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite their states’ blue leans, Democratic incumbents in Colorado and Washington could also face danger if things go well for the GOP. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington</a>, five-term Democratic Sen. Patty Murray is favored over Republican Tiffany Smiley, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/WA/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has almost kept pace with Murray in fundraising</a>. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado</a>, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet looks likely to defeat Republican Joe O’Dea. But Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-a-republican-win-colorados-senate-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have hoped O’Dea could surprise here</a> thanks to his business background and moderate profile based on his opposition to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although Republicans should win both contests, two other races are of interest thanks to the unusual nature of their elections: Alaska and Utah. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Under Alaska’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new electoral system</a>, which combines the nation’s first top-four primary with ranked choice voting in the general election, the Senate race has come down to two very different Republicans: Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Tshibaka, a former commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Administration. Thanks to her moderate reputation, Murkowski <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/murkowski-alaska-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is positioned to win</a> many independent and most Democratic votes, even though Tshibaka, who has former <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/06/18/trump-gives-complete-and-total-endorsement-to-tshibaka-in-alaska-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Donald Trump’s endorsement</a>, will likely win most Republican votes. In red-leaning <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska</a>, that has made for a very tight race, with each candidate having about a 1-in-2 shot of victory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/utah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utah</a> will feature a contest between Republican Sen. Mike Lee and independent Evan McMullin, who <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2016&amp;fips=49&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran for president in 2016</a> and won 21 percent in Utah as a conservative alternative to Trump. Lee is heavily favored to win, but McMullin did <a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/4/23/23037939/mike-lee-evan-mcmullin-utah-democrat-party-convention-results-senate-election-kael-weston" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive the state Democratic Party’s endorsement</a> as part of <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2022/10/28/does-evan-mcmullin-have-a-chance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to build a coalition</a> of Trump-skeptical Republicans, independents and Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for the remaining 23 seats, our forecast views the 15 Republican-held seats as solidly Republican and the eight Democratic-held seats as solidly Democratic. On paper, a handful of these states — such as Florida, Iowa and Oregon — could be competitive under some circumstances, but those conditions have not come to pass in 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All in all, close races in a few key states will likely decide which party has a majority. If Republicans make gains, that would <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely be in line with midterm history</a>: Dating back to World War II, the president’s party has lost seats in 13 of 19 midterms. But Democrats will hope they can add 2022 to the list of midterms in which the president’s party gained seats or at least avoided losses. And the stakes couldn’t be higher: Just one seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be the difference</a> between Republicans having full control of Congress and Democrats maintaining a foothold on Capitol Hill.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">When we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched our midterms forecast on June 30</a>, Republicans had a 53 percent chance of taking over the Senate from Democrats, and an 87 percent chance of taking over the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We could almost have turned our servers off and let that forecast stand. Today, in our final forecast of the cycle, Republicans have a 59 percent chance of winning the Senate and an 84 percent chance of winning the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before I dig deeper into this ostensible stability, a few words about the probabilistic nature of our forecast. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, let’s talk a bit more about that final GOP Senate number, 59 percent. It’s in an annoying zone as far as I’m concerned. If I met you on the street, I wouldn’t know how to describe the race. It’s on the brink between a toss-up and one that we say leans toward Republicans. And to make matters more confusing, that 59 percent figure comes from our Deluxe forecast, which includes the input of <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human expert forecasters like the Cook Political Report</a>. The Lite forecast (essentially a “polls only” version) and the Classic forecast (polls plus other objective indicators) have Republicans as just 50 and 51 percent “favorites,” respectively.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I don’t want to blow off that 59 percent number. Deluxe is supposed to be the most accurate version of our model. To be blunt, 59 percent is enough of an edge that if you offered to let me bet on Republicans at even money, I’d take it. (If I bet on politics, that is. Which I don’t.) Still, Democrats holding the Senate, or the race coming down to a runoff in Georgia, would not be surprising in the least.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the House, meanwhile, you shouldn’t round the Republicans’ 84 percent chance up to 100 or the Democrats’ 16 percent chance down to zero. Two years ago, Republicans had just a 3 percent chance of winning the House in our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final forecast</a> and yet came within five seats of doing so. The balance of the evidence suggests a national political environment that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-3-big-questions-i-still-have-about-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favors Republicans by only 2 to 3 percentage points</a>. And the polling itself, if anything, has been a little tighter than that. (Democrats have a 25 percent chance to keep the House in the polls-only Lite version of our forecast. After the redistricting process, Republicans have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less of an advantage</a> from gerrymandering and district boundaries than they did previously, so a roughly tied national environment would lead to a highly competitive race for the House — see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-3-big-questions-i-still-have-about-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday’s post</a> for much more detail on this.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-favored-final-midterm-forecasts-fivethirtyeight-92819264</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, the upside case for Republicans has perhaps been understated. Our model puts the 80th percentile range of outcomes in the House at between a <em>one</em>-seat and a 33-seat GOP gain; and remember, 20 percent of the time, the number will fall <em>outside</em> that range. Just as it isn’t that hard for the race in the House to become rather competitive, it also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t take much to turn it into a Republican landslide</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, just because we’ll start the night with roughly 50-50 odds in the Senate does <em>not</em> necessarily mean we’ll finish the night with the balance of power determined by just one or two seats. Fairly often, all the competitive races break the same way in races for Congress. There’s almost a 25 percent chance that Republicans wind up with 53 or more seats, according to our Deluxe forecast (and a 7 percent chance that Democrats do so).</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">As I mentioned earlier, the topline probabilities in our House and Senate forecasts are very similar to what they were in June. But surely some individual races changed a lot, especially in the Senate? Nope, not that either. Take a look at Republican chances of winning in the 12 most competitive Senate races.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In every state, the numbers are nearly identical. Of course, that doesn’t mean the race was steady the whole time. Democrats had much clearer polling leads in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a> during the late summer. They were even ahead in the polls in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, and tied in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a> — all states where they now trail.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One plausible explanation is that Democrats initially benefited from a focus of attention on the Supreme Court’s decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, but then fell back to earth as the news cycle began to emphasize other topics such as immigration, inflation and crime.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that our June 30 model launch came &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Dobbs decision, but before there had been much time for it to work its way into the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> There is probably some truth to that, but I’d be careful about assuming the story is that simple. For one thing, the president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically does worse in the polls the longer you go in the election cycle</a>. This time, though, Democrats are actually doing <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly better on the generic ballot</a> on the day of the election — trailing by 1.2 percentage points — than they were on June 23, the day before the Dobbs decision, when they trailed by 2.3 percentage points. That’s unusual historically and does suggest some lasting impact from Dobbs.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/election-deniers-favored-win-midterm-races-fivethirtyeight-92803581</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Also, while Democrats might have abortion working for them, they have a lot working against them, including inflation (polling shifts have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/18/gas-prices-election-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly correlated with changes in gas prices</a>) an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular president</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/migrant-border-crossings-fiscal-year-2022-topped-276-million-breaking-rcna53517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record numbers of migrants</a> at the Mexican border and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very long history of poor performance for the president’s party at the midterms</a>. If the polls are <em>exactly</em> right — they won’t be, but let’s play along — and Republicans win only 15 House seats or so while the Senate comes down to another runoff in Georgia — that would be a pretty good night for Democrats relative to historic norms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, that is one reason to expect the polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-republican-sweep-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might <em>not</em> be right</a> and could be biased against Republicans again. And yet, the Democrats’ summer boomlet was real, realized not just in the polls but also in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of ballot initiatives and special-election outcomes</a>. If you don’t trust the polls, should you default to the fundamentals or to actual election results, like the upset wins Democrats had in races from Alaska to New York? You can <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-democratic-surprise-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a decent case either way</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact is that American voters are under a lot of conflicting pressures. They care about the Supreme Court, the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and Republican extremism, but they also care about inflation, crime and immigration, issues that have historically had a large influence on elections. Meanwhile, partisanship is high and tends to swamp all other factors; incumbency and candidate quality matter less than they used to. In any event, those various forces of political gravity have put us roughly back in the same place as we were in June.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">One final word: While we’ve tried to prepare you for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three basic scenarios</a> — polls roughly correct, polls biased against Republicans, polls biased against Democrats — those aren’t the only uncertainties in play. Although polling and forecast errors are correlated from race to race in midterms, they aren’t correlated <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much as they are in presidential races</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In one of the practice runs I did for the ABC News TV set — please tune in tonight! — the producers tried to throw us for a loop by having Don Bolduc, the Republican candidate for Senate in New Hampshire, win his race but Sen. Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent in Georgia, wins his race without a runoff. Sounds impossible, right? Well, it’s not <em>that</em> crazy: such an outcome occurs about 5 percent of the time in our simulations. And while there’s been a lot of focus on Georgia, Pennsylvania and Nevada, some state <em>other</em> than those three is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping-point_state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tipping point state</a> in our simulations 56 percent of the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the election is close, it could take a long time to obtain certainty about who controls Congress, whether because of the Georgia runoff, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long time it takes to count ballots in some states</a>, legal challenges, or <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates refusing to accept the results</a>. A lot of coverage has focused on these concerns as they relate to 2024, but frankly I’m worried about what a razor-thin result would mean <em>this</em> year, too. We’ve appreciated your following our election coverage this year, and we’ll do the best we can to cover a potentially long and messy aftermath.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">With less than 24 hours to go until we <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1588213427461390337?s=20&amp;t=ouRzHDSGLpdb8mdtVUq4fg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freeze our model</a>,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll freeze it at midnight Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> we’re probably not going to see a lot more changes in the topline forecast. Republicans have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent chance</a> of winning the Senate and an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">83 percent chance</a> in the House, according to our Deluxe forecast. Those numbers have been relatively steady for the past few days.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s instead ask three big <em>forecasting</em> questions about the race. These aren’t questions like “how much will abortion matter,” which I hope we’re doing a good job of addressing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/control-of-the-senate-could-rest-on-abortion-and-inflation-in-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elsewhere at FiveThirtyEight</a>. Instead, they’re questions that will inform our understanding of future elections from an analytical, polling and forecasting standpoint.</p>



<h2><strong>Question 1: Will the polls be systematically wrong?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered this topic so often</a> that you might think I have nothing more to say about it — but you’d be wrong!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s partly because it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really is the whole ballgame</a>, at least when it comes to which party keeps control of the Senate. If Republicans beat their polling averages by, say, 3 percentage points across the board, it would be very unlikely for Democrats to salvage the Senate even if there’s some state-to-state variation. (Perhaps they could hold on in Arizona and New Hampshire, but they’d be considerable underdogs in Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania, where they need to win two out of the three.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, if <em>Democrats</em> beat their polls by 3 points across the board, the picture is very rosy for them. In that event, they’d be favorites in Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Arizona and New Hampshire would probably be out of reach for Republicans. But conversely, Ohio, North Carolina and Wisconsin would be <em>in</em> reach for Democrats. The House would also be highly competitive in this circumstance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which type of polling error is more likely? If you’ve been following these election updates, you’ve probably noticed me <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrestling back and forth</a> between a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-democratic-surprise-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“trust the process” mentality</a>, where I take the FiveThirtyEight’s model’s output as gospel, and a concern that the model may still be underestimating the chance of a pro-Democratic bias in the polls as we saw in 2016 and 2020.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/parties-making-final-pitches-voters-fivethirtyeight-politics-92670196</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">For what it’s worth, I’ve <em>mostly</em> landed on “trust the process.” My personal view of the race is pretty well aligned with the FiveThirtyEight Deluxe model. The polls could very well be biased against Republicans again. The best reason to think so is probably <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-republican-sweep-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “Nathan Redd” argument</a> that as polling gets more difficult, you should put more faith in the fundamentals. Usually, the president’s party has a rough midterm, especially when the president has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42 percent approval rating</a> and inflation is at <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.2 percent</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not hard to imagine how the polls could be biased <em>against</em> Democrats instead. After 2016 and 2020, pollsters <a href="https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/719276/why-it-matters-if-the-polls-miss-again/?unlock=G312XOQO4PT6RXHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face more reputational risk from again missing high on Democrats than the other way around</a>, and that could consciously or unconsciously affect decisions they make at the margin, or even <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-some-pollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which polls they release to the public</a>. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/upshot/polling-averages-midterm-election.html?te=1&amp;nl=the-tilt&amp;emc=edit_nc_20221106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">composition of polling averages has considerably changed</a>, with fewer “gold standard” polls and more quick-and-dirty ones that tend to show more favorable results for Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’m not sympathetic to Democratic complaints <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/biden-gap-senate-surveys-00064362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about Republican pollsters “flooding the zone.”</a> Not all polls with a Republican-leaning house effect actually have any formal affiliation with the GOP. Also, to the extent that polls do have a house effect — that is, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/calculating-house-effects-of-polling-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently leaning toward Democrats or Republicans</a> — our model adjusts for it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Besides, being the University of Chicago economics major that I am, I mostly trust the market to sort everything out. Firms with a Republican house effect will lose business and credibility in future election cycles if Democrats have a good night. Conversely, some traditional pollsters like Monmouth University <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreyvs/status/1588599446665056256?s=20&amp;t=iqbIPo1okDpxWpupdJuj2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t even publishing final horse race numbers</a> in the races that they’re polling. If GOP-leaning firms like Trafalgar or InsiderAdvantage are willing to put their credibility on the line and Monmouth isn’t, that tells you something.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, we’re a long way removed from the Golden Age of Polling circa 2006-2012 when “gold standard” pollsters (live-caller telephone polls with transparent methodologies) could be counted upon to set a reliable benchmark. Nobody in the polling or election forecasting community has any right to be all that confident about what will happen on Tuesday. That might make you want to give up and trust the vibes<em> </em>or insider sentiment about the race, which is <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/why-republican-insiders-think-the-gop-is-poised-for-a-blowout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bearish for Democrats</a>. But the track record of vibes is that they’re somewhere between useless and worse-than-useless, like in 2016 when <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insiders thought Hillary Clinton would have a cakewalk</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/governors-races-watch-fivethirtyeight-92674801</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also worth mentioning that the FiveThirtyEight Deluxe model is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-our-model-thinks-the-polls-might-be-biased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly more favorable for Republicans in the Senate than the polls-only version</a> of our forecast, which essentially means that it does predict a little bit of pro-Democratic bias in the polls, especially in some of the redder states such as Ohio. So by endorsing Deluxe’s view, I’m putting a pinky finger on the scale for the view that polls will again have a Democratic bias, while also being open to a mere severe bias in either direction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I do think this is a big year for the pollsters. In 2016, the polling error <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t really all that bad</a>, and pollsters had a semi-decent array of excuses from shifts in voter coalitions that made it important to weight polls by educational attainment to a crazy <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October and November news cycle, including the Comey letter</a>. In 2020, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 presented real challenges for polling</a>. This year, there aren’t as many contingencies. Most Americans have given up on COVID-19 precautions, there have been no late-breaking news events with obvious electoral implications, and Donald Trump isn’t on the ballot. </p>



<h2><strong>Question 2: How big will the turnout gap be?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"> I’m sorry to repeat the biggest cliche in election analysis, but if the polls are roughly in the right vicinity, control of the Senate will come down to turnout. If you care about the outcome and haven’t voted, you should do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On that front, Democrats got good news on Sunday with two major network polls showing a relatively small turnout gap. (I’ll use the terms “turnout gap” and “enthusiasm gap” interchangeably here; in both cases, I refer to the difference in margin between the likely voter and registered voter version of a poll.) The <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/economic-discontent-fuels-gop-hopes-midterms-draw-close/story?id=92679694&amp;mc_cid=9b9e5c0c66&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a>, from our colleagues at ABC News and The Washington Post, showed Republicans 1 point ahead on the generic ballot among registered voters but 2 points ahead among likely voters, making for only a 1-point enthusiasm gap in the GOP’s favor. Meanwhile, an NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/nbc-news-poll-democrats-catch-gop-enthusiasm-rcna55859" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> had the generic ballot tied among registered voters but Democrats 1 point <em>ahead</em> among likely voters, meaning that there was actually a tiny enthusiasm gap in Democrats’ favor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In both cases, that reflects improvements in Democratic enthusiasm from earlier this cycle. The previous ABC News/Washington Post <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-struggles-party-democrats-2024-poll/story?id=90427262" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> had shown a 4-point turnout gap favoring Republicans, and the prior NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/anger-minds-nbc-news-poll-finds-sky-high-interest-polarization-ahead-m-rcna53512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> had Republicans gaining 2 points from their likely voter screen instead of it helping Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most other polls show a modest enthusiasm gap in favor of Republicans. Republicans gain 3 points from the likely voter screen in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/cnn-poll-gop-congressional-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN’s recent generic ballot poll</a>, for instance, 2 points from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/us/politics/republicans-economy-nyt-siena-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siena College and The New York Times</a>, and 1 point from <a href="https://echeloninsights.com/in-the-news/2022-omnibus-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echelon Insights</a>. But these numbers can be noisy. In Marquette Law School’s early October <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/10/12/new-marquette-law-school-poll-survey-of-wisconsin-voters-finds-johnson-leading-barnes-in-senate-race-evers-and-michels-in-a-gubernatorial-toss-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> of Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race, the race was tied among registered voters but Republican Sen. Ron Johnson led by 6 points among likely voters. In Marquette’s more recent <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/11/02/mlsp74-press-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a>, however, Johnson led by 3 among registered voters but actually lost a point and led by 2 among likely voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If there could be anything from a 6-point turnout gap favoring Republicans (as in Marquette’s October poll) to a 1-point turnout gap favoring Democrats (as in its latest one), that creates a wide range of plausible outcomes. And neither of those scenarios are necessarily crazy. There was roughly a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-point enthusiasm gap</a> favoring the GOP in the 2010 midterm, for example. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A turnout gap of <em>any</em> magnitude favoring Democrats would be unusual — typically voters from the opposition party have more enthusiasm at the midterms than the president’s party, and typically Republican voters are more likely to turn out than Democratic ones. But political coalitions are shifting, with Democrats increasingly relying on college graduates, who are <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html#:~:text=High%20school%20graduate%20turnout%20was,that%20were%20not%20significantly%20different." target="_blank" rel="noopener">considerably more likely to turn out to vote</a>. Moreover, there are some tangible signs of high Democratic enthusiasm. Their House and Senate candidates have <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/raising-bythenumbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised more money</a> than Republican ones, and Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed very well</a> in a series of ballot initiatives and special elections over the summer, often on the basis of superior turnout.</p>



<h2><strong>A Wonky Aside About The Generic Ballot, the House Popular Vote, and the “National Environment”</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before we get to the third question, a note on terminology. You’ll often hear us use the terms “generic ballot,” “House popular vote” and “national environment,” but they mean somewhat different things.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot tracker</a> combines what are really two types of polls. One set of polls asks voters which party they’d rather see in control of Congress. Another type asks them whether they plan to vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in their U.S. House race.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, the poll will actually name the candidates in the voter’s district — “do you plan to vote for Joe Schmoe, the Democrat, or Jane Doe, the Republican?” — but this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> Since these questions tend to produce similar results, we combine them to increase the sample size and consider both to be <strong>generic ballot</strong> polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the election, you can evaluate these polls based on how well they predicted the <strong>House popular vote</strong>. That’s the number you get when you add up votes for Democratic and Republican U.S. House candidates in all 435 Congressional districts. In 2020, for instance, Democrats won this measure by <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.1 percentage points</a> — similar to, but less than, Joe Biden’s 4.5-point win in the presidential popular vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One potential source of divergence between these measures is that in some districts there’s no Democrat or Republican on the ballot, either because the party didn’t bother to nominate a candidate or because it’s a state like California and the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Top-two_primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top two finishers in the primary</a> advanced to the general election regardless of party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, there are considerably more districts with no Democratic nominee than with no Republican. Specifically, there are 23 House districts with no Democrat on the ballot<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although in 2 of those districts, the state doesn’t count the vote when a race is uncontested so it doesn’t become part of the national popular vote tally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> but 12 with no Republican. Moreover, the districts with no Democratic nominee tend to be more competitive than those with no Republican one, meaning that Democrats are sacrificing more votes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s slightly tricky to calculate exactly how big this effect is, but it will likely shift the final House popular vote margin by at least 1 percentage point toward Republicans, and probably more like 1.5 percentage points. In other words, if the final <em>generic ballot</em> margin was Republicans by 3 percentage points, we’d expect them to win the House <em>popular vote</em> by more like 4.5 percentage points because of all the districts with missing Democratic candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, you’ll sometimes hear an analyst like me describe the “<strong>national environment,” </strong>usually in a context like the following: “Democrats will need a D+1 or D+2 national environment to keep the House.” This term is more ambiguous, although I think of it as referring to what you’d expect to happen in a perfectly neutral setting: a district with no incumbent, two “average” candidates, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no partisan lean</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s sort through how all of these numbers work this year:</p>



<ul><li>Our generic ballot tracker has Republicans ahead by <strong>1.1 percentage point</strong>.</li><li>However, our model uses a slightly different version of the generic ballot that includes a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/">likely voter adjustment</a>.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our polling averages, we default to using the likely voter version of a poll if a pollster provides one, but if they don’t, we let them roll with the registered voter numbers. In our &lt;em&gt;forecast&lt;/em&gt;, by contrast, we adjust the registered voter numbers based on our model’s estimate of the enthusiasm gap — an adjustment that favors Republicans this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> This helps Republicans, and they’re ahead by <strong>1.7 percentage points </strong>in this version.</li><li>Here’s where it gets more complicated. Our model also makes a forecast of the House popular vote. The estimate is determined by literally forecasting the popular vote in each district one race at a time. It is <em>not</em> just based on the generic ballot: it also accounts for factors such as district-by-district polling and incumbency. We also forecast how many people will vote in each district, accounting for past turnout and even factors such as population growth. Currently, this forecast has Republicans winning the House popular vote by <strong>4.0 percentage points</strong>. </li><li>However, as mentioned earlier, when you tally up the race-by-race forecasts, Democrats get a lot of zeros in their column because of all the districts with no Democrat running. If you back out this effect — if both parties had a candidate on the ballot in every district — Republicans would be predicted to win the House popular vote by more like <strong>2.5 percentage points</strong> instead. This is roughly what I think of as FiveThirtyEight’s forecast of the national environment. It’s about how you’d expect a Congressional race to go in an average district with no incumbent or partisan lean.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">So in case you’re wondering why Democrats have only a 17 percent chance of winning the House despite our generic ballot average being within a percentage point: our more detailed forecast suggests that Republicans have more like a 2- or 3-point advantage. On top of that, they have a slight advantage because of how voters are distributed between districts, although this is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than it was before redistricting</a>. Thus, Democrats would have to beat our forecast of the national environment by 3 or perhaps 3.5 percentage points to be favored to win the House. That’s hardly impossible — we’re talking about a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal-sized polling error</a> — but it’s a little tougher than our generic ballot average implies.</p>



<h2><strong>Question 3: How much does candidate quality matter?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here’s an important fact about this election that’s become somewhat obscured. If it weren’t for the candidates — some relatively strong Democrats and some relatively weak Republicans — Democrats would be completely screwed in the Senate, barring a major polling error.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As I said, FiveThirtyEight estimates that the national environment favors Republicans by about 2.5 percentage points. Now take a look at the states where pivotal Senate races are being held: Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Ohio are all <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning relative to the country overall</a>. (Consider that Biden underperformed his 4.5- point national popular vote victory in each of these states, even though he won several of them.) New Hampshire is Democratic-leaning according to our index, but just barely, enough that you’d expect it to also go Republican in a year where the national environment is GOP +2.5.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So if all races went according to the national environment plus the state’s partisan lean, Democrats would lose the seats they currently hold in Nevada, Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire while failing to make any gains from Republicans, resulting in a 54-46 GOP Senate. That sort of outcome is <em>not</em> out of the realm of possibility by any means at all, but it’s relatively unlikely. The GOP may well pay a price for its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-hard-to-win-a-senate-race-when-youve-never-won-an-election-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inexperienced</a>, unpopular and in some cases <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/4/23387712/herschel-walker-georgia-senate-raphael-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandal-plagued</a> candidates. Just how much of one could determine which party winds up with Senate control.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Most of the time in the U.S., we elect politicians to make policy. But <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/forget-about-the-candidates-what-else-is-on-the-ballot-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every election year</a>, some voters are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-21-ballot-measures-were-watching-this-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confronted</a> with making their own policy decisions. Ballot measures ask voters to weigh in directly on issues from the explosive to the mundane.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But direct democracy ain’t what it used to be. According to the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/ballot-measures-database.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, Americans are voting on only 136 ballot measures this November — the second-fewest in a biennial election since 1988.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes ballot measures in American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; Puerto Rico; Washington, D.C.; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Ballot measures are on the decline" aria-label="Column Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3ZHYx/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="426" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it doesn’t take a big number of ballot measures to have a big impact  — and some of this year’s ballot measures could significantly change policy if they pass. We’ve identified 28 particularly contentious proposals on ballots across the country on topics from abortion access to voting rights to drugs to the very nature of ballot measures themselves. Here’s what you should know.</p>



<h2><strong>Abortion</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade thrust abortion to the top of the list of things at stake in this election, as states are now free to ban or protect abortion as they see fit. According to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_abortion_ballot_measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ballotpedia</a>, six abortion-related measures were or are on the ballot in 2022. Arguably the most significant is in <strong>Michigan</strong>. The state still has a law on the books from 1931 that bans abortion, but a court has <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/09/court-rules-michigans-abortion-ban-unconstitutional.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it on hold</a> pending a final decision from the state Supreme Court. However, Proposal 3 on the Michigan ballot would create a state constitutional right to “<a href="https://www.house.mi.gov/hfa/PDF/Alpha/Ballot_Proposal_3_of_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reproductive freedom</a>.” So if it passes, the court fight would be moot: Abortion would be legal in Michigan. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unsurprisingly, the initiative in Michigan has drawn a ton of attention. The campaign has attracted <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/proposal-3-abortion-measure-generates-57m-michigan-campaign-donations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$57 million in donations</a> — more than the state’s governor, attorney-general and secretary-of-state races combined. Supporters of abortion rights have outraised opponents, $40 million to $17 million, and “yes” on Proposal 3 has led in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BB7BQ4DI9ZspfM9QEDmvu4pQibsSjC0qbzYrn_Dm_Oo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every poll we’ve seen</a>. However, support has fallen recently, which is typical for ballot measures but could be a concern among abortion-rights supporters. For example, the Glengariff Group/Detroit News/WDIV-TV found the question passing 62 percent to 24 percent among likely voters in <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/decision-2022/2022/10/05/poll-where-michigan-voters-stand-on-term-limits-abortion-rights-voting-rights-ballot-proposals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late September</a> but only 55 percent to 41 percent in <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/decision-2022/2022/11/01/poll-where-michigan-voters-stand-on-3-ballot-proposals-1-week-before-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late October</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/parties-making-final-pitches-voters-fivethirtyeight-politics-92670196</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, <strong>Kentucky</strong> will vote on a completely opposite ballot measure: Amendment 2 would make explicit that the state constitution does <em>not</em> protect abortion rights. Abortion is currently prohibited in the state, but abortion-rights advocates have <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2022/08/02/kentucky-abortion-ban-reinstated-after-court-grants-camerons-request/65388729007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenged the ban in court</a>. If the amendment passes, it will end their efforts to overturn the ban. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An anti-abortion ballot measure may seem like a shoo-in in a state as red as Kentucky, but that’s what people thought about Kansas before it rejected a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-abortion-vote-in-kansas-looks-like-its-going-to-be-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar referendum</a> in August. According to modeling from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/upshot/kansas-abortion-vote-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Upshot at The New York Times</a>, the level of opposition that amendment got in Kansas suggests that it would just narrowly fail in Kentucky. We haven’t seen any polls of the Kentucky measure, but abortion-rights supporters have outraised opponents there, <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/27/kentucky-abortion-bill-fight-amendment-2-crosses-6-million-mark/69590802007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5.2 million to $952,000</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>California</strong> and <strong>Vermont</strong> will also vote to include reproductive rights in their state constitutions, but the stakes are significantly lower. Abortion is already legal and protected in both states. The states are also so liberal that the protections (<a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/election-2022/2022/10/california-abortion-law-prop-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 1</a> in California and <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2022/09/28/campaign-countdown-inside-prop-5-vermonts-reproductive-liberty-amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 5</a> in Vermont) are expected to pass easily. For example, Proposal 5 led 75 percent to 18 percent in a recent <a href="https://webpubcontent.gray.tv/wcax/docs/PollThursday.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of New Hampshire/WCAX-TV poll</a>. However, in California, Democrats are still <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/10/17/californias-pro-abortion-ballot-measure-is-poised-to-pass-so-why-are-democrats-spending-so-much-time-and-money-on-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending heavily</a> in favor of Prop 1, perhaps to help Democratic politicians also on the ballot.</p>



<h2><strong>Elections</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the wake of the 2020 election, several states have tightened their voting laws or expanded access to the polls, and nine ballot measures this year could follow in that tradition. For instance, at least two states could enact stricter voter-ID laws. <strong>Arizona</strong>’s <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/11/how-arizona-prop-309-would-change-voting-id-requirements/8199456001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 309</a> would require an unexpired photo ID to vote in person — no exceptions. It would also require those who vote by mail to supply their date of birth and driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. <strong>Nebraska</strong>’s <a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/backers-foes-of-ballot-initiatives-make-final-pitch-at-public-hearing/article_ab307f6c-6885-5323-bc82-2fddf5de4e84.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initiative 432</a> would also amend the state constitution to require a photo ID to vote. Currently, Nebraska is the only strongly Republican state <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without a voter-ID law</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other end of the spectrum, <strong>Michigan</strong>’s <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/voting-rights-ballot-measure-what-proposal-2-would-change-michigan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 2</a> would make voting more accessible by implementing nine days of early voting, requiring a ballot drop box for every 15,000 voters in a municipality and providing free postage for absentee ballots. <a href="https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2022/10/EPIC-MRA-October-14-2022-statewide-poll-results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls</a> have <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/decision-2022/2022/11/01/poll-where-michigan-voters-stand-on-3-ballot-proposals-1-week-before-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> this initiative passing with even more support than the proposal expanding access to abortion. Additionally, <strong>Connecticut</strong> could also begin using early voting if <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2022/10/30/ct-early-voting-constitutional-amendment-black-latino-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 1</a> passes. The state is one of only <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four</a> that does not currently offer any early voting.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/governors-races-watch-fivethirtyeight-92674801</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The rules of elections could also change in a few states if other measures pass. Most notably, <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-question-3-open-primaries-and-ranked-choice-voting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 3</a> in <strong>Nevada</strong> will determine whether the state scraps traditional partisan primaries in favor of one in which all candidates run on the same ballot. The top five vote-getters would then advance to a ranked-choice general election. (This is similar to <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/RCV.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska’s new system</a>.) But Question 3 looks unlikely to pass: Leaders from both parties have <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/bipartisan-opposition-to-question-3-mounts-with-more-republicans-against" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come out against it</a>. And in a recent poll from <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-sisolak-cortez-masto-narrowly-lead-gop-opponents-in-days-ahead-of-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent</a>, 44 percent of likely voters said they supported it, and 41 percent said they opposed it. But polls tend to <a href="https://catalist.us/2021/05/yes-you-can-generally-trust-issue-polling-but-theres-a-catch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overestimate support for ballot measures</a>. (Voters, it turns out, are leery of changing the status quo.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two states are even considering ballot measures that will restrict <em>future</em> ballot measures. <a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/local-regional-news/2022-10-26/history-of-arkansas-ballot-initiatives-explores-50-60-threshold-of-issue-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Issue 2</a> in <strong>Arkansas</strong> would require that citizen-initiated ballot measures and all constitutional amendments get 60 percent support to pass. <strong>Arizona</strong>’s <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/19/prop-132-called-both-rational-tax-safeguard-anti-democratic-power-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 132</a> would set the same threshold for ballot initiatives that would raise taxes. Also, in the Grand Canyon State, <a href="https://www.kold.com/2022/11/01/gop-backed-arizona-ballot-measures-target-voter-initiatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 128</a> would allow the state Legislature to repeal or change laws enacted via ballot measure if any part of them is struck down by the Arizona or U.S. Supreme Court. And <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/31/single-and-loving-it-prop-129-would-limit-ballot-measures-to-one-subject/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 129</a> would require initiatives to stick to a single subject. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These may sound like esoteric, unimportant changes. But they’re part of a larger pattern of Republican legislatures nationwide trying to <a href="https://boltsmag.org/ballot-measures-arizona-arkansas-direct-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat policies that pass via ballot initiative</a>. For example, in recent years, Arkansas voters raised the minimum wage and legalized medicinal marijuana. And Arizona voters legalized recreational marijuana and increased taxes on the wealthy to fund teacher salaries. In response, Republican legislators put Issue 2, Prop 128, Prop 129 and Prop 132 on the ballot to make it harder for similar initiatives to pass.</p>



<h2><strong>Drugs</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Direct democracy has been a game-changer for the movement to legalize pot, particularly in conservative states. Of the 19 states and Washington, D.C., that <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow recreational marijuana use</a>, 13 legalized it at the ballot box. And this year, five more states could join the club: <strong>Arkansas</strong> (where the measure is labeled Issue 4), <strong>Maryland</strong> (Question 4), <strong>Missouri</strong> (Amendment 3), <strong>North Dakota</strong> (Measure 2) and <strong>South Dakota</strong> (Measure 27). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maryland may have the best odds of legalizing marijuana. A recent <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-sun-poll-cannabis-legalization-support-20221031-imm4bjoknfb4hifpq5nbysn6o4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpinionWorks/Baltimore Sun/University of Baltimore poll</a> found Question 4 leading 63 percent to 25 percent among likely voters. The campaign is tighter in other states: In Arkansas, “yes” on Issue 4 led a recent survey from <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2022/10/poll-opposition-to-recreational-marijuana-amendment-grows-but-slight-majority-still-favor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hendrix College/Talk Business &amp; Politics</a> just 51 percent to 43 percent. And Amendment 3 in Missouri had 47 percent support and 39 percent opposition in an <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/missouri-2022-republican-eric-schmitt-maintains-double-digit-lead-over-democrat-trudy-busch-valentine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College/The Hill poll</a>. We haven’t seen any polling of North Dakota, but it looks like weed will remain illegal in neighboring South Dakota. Measure 27 was losing 51 percent to 40 percent in an October poll from <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/south-dakota-2022-majority-of-voters-support-governor-noem-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College/The Hill/KELO-TV</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Colorado</strong> could also become the second state to allow the use of psilocybin, a psychedelic substance found in some mushrooms. The campaign to pass Proposition 122 has raised <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/colorado-issue-committees-raise-nearly-30-million-to-influence-vote-on-ballot-measures/article_37051932-44db-11ed-acce-036e3c69b646.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than $250,000 since mid-July</a>. But opponents, who include <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/10/27/public-officials-sign-on-to-effort-opposing-decriminalization-of-psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elected officials</a> and, interestingly, members of the state's underground psychedelic community concerned about losing <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/10/14/psychedelic-mushrooms-prop-122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their culture</a>, started running an active campaign only a few weeks ago. An <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/politics/election/poll-legal-mushrooms-prop-122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College/The Hill/KDVR-TV/KWGN-TV poll</a> recently found 43 percent of likely voters in support and 44 percent against the measure.</p>



<h2><strong>Other topics</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another liberal policy that has proven popular at the ballot box, even in red states: expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Since 2018, Idaho, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Utah have voted to do so, bringing the total number of <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states that have expanded Medicaid</a> to 38 (plus Washington, D.C.). <strong>South Dakota</strong> looks like it’s on track to be number 39. The aforementioned Emerson College/The Hill/KELO-TV poll found Amendment D, which would expand Medicaid in the state, passing 51 percent to 22 percent. However, a significant 28 percent were undecided.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Voters in at least two states will decide whether to grant certain public services to undocumented immigrants. In <strong>Massachusetts, </strong><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/10/31/metro/massachusetts-election-2022-voter-guide-question-4-drivers-licenses-undocumented-immigrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 4</a> would uphold a law allowing undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses. An average of two <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/massachusetts2/2022/10_18_2022_marginals.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=5E596EF808783280091104706DE85079E206CDA8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/%7CElectionToplinesOctoberMassPoll2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> found the measure passing, 54 percent to 39 percent. Similarly, <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/26/higher-ed-math-proposition-308-would-let-dreamers-pay-in-state-tuition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 308</a> in <strong>Arizona</strong> would allow students, regardless of immigration status, to receive in-state tuition at public universities if they have lived in the state for two years and obtained a diploma from a state high school. Voters overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure to ban this in 2006, but Arizona has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-arizona-became-a-swing-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten more liberal</a> since then. Still, likely voters were split, with 45 percent supporting it and 43 percent opposing it, in a recent <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/ohpi-poll-of-record-close-races-up-and-down-the-ticket-in-arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights survey</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least two states will also vote on raising their minimum wages: <strong>Nevada</strong> to $12 per hour<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the state already has a $12 minimum wage for employees who are not offered employer-provided health insurance, but this measure &lt;a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-what-does-question-2-on-the-2022-nevada-ballot-do-about-minimum-wage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;would extend that minimum wage to all employees&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of their insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a> and <strong>Nebraska</strong> to $15 per hour. According to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Minimum_wage_on_the_ballot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ballotpedia</a>, states have considered 22 ballot measures to raise the minimum wage since 1998, and all 22 have passed. And these two look like they’ll be no exceptions: The measure in Nebraska, dubbed <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/is-it-time-for-nebraska-to-have-a-15-per-hour-minimum-wage-voters-will-decide-tuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initiative 433</a>, led 55 percent to 34 percent in a <a href="https://www.neilanstrategygroup.com/_files/ugd/4093a6_67f88b0f48ab44a198560203f11ed866.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Targeting/Neilan Strategy Group poll</a> from late September. And Nevada’s <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-what-does-question-2-on-the-2022-nevada-ballot-do-about-minimum-wage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 2</a> was up 65 percent to 24 percent in an October poll from the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2022/nevada-general-election-polling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Nevada, Reno</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least two more states will weigh in on gun-rights questions — one conservative, one progressive. <a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2022/11/03/iowa-voters-decide-new-gun-rights-amendment-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amendment 1</a> in <strong>Iowa</strong> would enshrine the right to bear arms in the state constitution and subject any gun regulations to “<a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2022/11/01/strict-scrutiny-key-understanding-proposed-gun-amendment-nov-8-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strict scrutiny</a>” by a court. If it passes, the ballot measure could <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/01/iowans-vote-whether-add-right-to-keep-and-bear-arms-constitution-gun-rights/10308509002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endanger current gun-control laws</a> and discourage the passage of new ones. A <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2022/10/24/iowa-gun-amendment-ballot-measure-midterm-elections-likely-pass-poll/69562113007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll by Selzer &amp; Co.</a> for the Des Moines Register/Mediacom gave it 58 percent support and 37 percent opposition. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2022/10/oregon-gun-control-measure-114-attracts-national-attention-as-one-of-strictest-in-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Measure 114</a> in <strong>Oregon</strong> would ban high-capacity magazines and make it much harder to buy a gun. The measure has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/30/1132122321/oregon-ballot-measure-114-more-difficult-buy-guns-permits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitterly divided</a> the state’s gun-rights supporters and opponents: A recent poll from <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/20221102_OR_NelsonMemo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nelson Research</a> found Measure 114 coming up just short, 49 percent to 46 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, no ballot-measure round-up would be complete without mentioning <strong>California</strong>, the ballot-measure capital of the United States. According to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/2022_ballot_measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ballotpedia</a>, the Golden State is home to the two most expensive ballot-measure campaigns of the 2022 cycle, which are both on the same topic. <a href="https://abc30.com/california-sports-betting-prop-26-27-legalized-gambling/12346713/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 26</a> would legalize sports betting in person at Native American casinos and horse tracks, and Proposition 27 would legalize it online. The two measures <a href="https://calmatters.org/economy/2022/06/sports-betting-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are not mutually exclusive</a>, but Native American tribes have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/2022-california-election-proposition-26-27-sports-betting-gambling-money-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent over $100 million</a> to pass Prop 26 and defeat Prop 27. Meanwhile, online sports-betting companies FanDuel, Bet MGM, Penn Interactive Ventures and DraftKings have contributed more than $100 million combined to pass Prop 27. Non-tribal casinos and gaming organizations have also poured $44 million into defeating Prop 26. Ironically, the three sides seem to have doomed <em>both</em> measures’ chances with their <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-04/2022-california-election-sports-betting-propostion-26-27-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative TV ads</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/ppic-statewide-survey-californians-and-their-government-october-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Institute of California</a>, voters oppose Prop 26, 57 percent to 34 percent, and Prop 27, 67 percent to 26 percent. In recent weeks, the “yes” campaigns for both measures have seemingly <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/2022/10/whats-next-for-sports-wagering-in-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conceded defeat</a> by scaling back their <a href="https://kesq.com/news/your-vote/2022/10/20/polls-show-californias-two-sports-betting-props-likely-to-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV ads</a>.</p>

The other 108 may not have major national implications, but they will still make a difference in their states. So before you head to the polls, make sure you research not only the candidates but also the policy questions on your ballot.</p>]]></description>
