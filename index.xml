			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">For two months we’ve known that Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams won New York City’s Democratic primary for mayor with 31 percent of first-place votes (he finally achieved a majority in the ranked-choice election after <a href="https://vote.nyc/sites/default/files/pdf/election_results/2021/20210622Primary%20Election/rcv/DEM%20Mayor%20Citywide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight rounds</a> of instant runoffs). But for two months we haven’t known for sure exactly what his coalition looked like. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the wait is over: 57 days after the election, the New York City Board of Elections released <a href="https://vote.nyc/page/election-results-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precinct-level results</a> of the primary. And they show that Adams’s enigmatic politics found a broad coalition — but one that exists outside the city’s usual power centers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adams’s politics are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor-nyc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard to pigeonhole</a>. (For instance, the former police officer campaigned as the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/eric-adams-nyc-mayor-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-police candidate</a>, but he had previously been an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/nyregion/eric-adams-nyc-police-mayor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocate for reform</a> within the department.) But perhaps his one unifying characteristic is his anti-elitism, sometimes to the point of grievance. He campaigned first and foremost as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/26/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crusader for New York City’s large nonwhite working class</a>, using Manhattan’s ivory tower and its “fancy candidates” as a foil. When former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia and businessman Andrew Yang formed a last-minute alliance with the goal of stopping Adams, he <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/adams-campaign-calls-garcia-yang-alliance-voter-suppression-on-final-day-of-early-voting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equated it</a> to the suppression of Black and Hispanic voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It looks like that branding succeeded. Adams carried most of the city’s neighborhoods outside its cosmopolitan core. </p>

Going just off voters’ first choices, Adams won three of the five political boroughs, albeit with different levels of support. </p>

</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with Adams’s strongest political borough: the <strong>Black Bloc</strong>, a 63 percent non-Hispanic Black and 23 percent college-educated swath of Brooklyn and Queens. This was Adams’s <a href="https://www.brooklyn-usa.org/eric-adams-bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home turf</a> (he was born in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brownsville and grew up in the Queens neighborhood of South Jamaica), and unsurprisingly, he dominated here, winning 63 percent of first-place votes. Within the borough, he tended to do better in state Assembly districts with larger Black populations and lower median household incomes, although the correlation was stronger with race than with income.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R = 0.91 vs. R = -0.71.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adams also excelled in the Black neighborhoods of the <strong>Crossroads</strong>, a racially diverse political borough that covers zones of transition between the other four. He got at least 45 percent of first-place votes in each of three gentrifying but still majority-Black Assembly districts <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=56&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">east of</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Diana-C-Richardson/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn’s</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Rodneyse-Bichotte-Hermelyn/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospect Park</a>. But parts of the Crossroads with smaller Black populations were more Adams-skeptical, such as two <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=34&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Queens</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Catalina-Cruz/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">districts</a> where he received fewer than 20 percent of initial votes. Overall, his share of first-place votes in the Crossroads borough (37 percent) was fairly close to its Black population share (30 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it wasn’t just in predominantly Black areas that Adams ran up the score. He was the first choice of 47 percent of voters in the <strong>True-Blue Bronx</strong>, which does have a sizable non-Hispanic Black population (29 percent) but is mostly Hispanic (57 percent). While there was still a strong correlation between Adams support and the Black population in this political borough (e.g., he performed the strongest in the heavily Black <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Carl-E-Heastie/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">northeast Bronx</a>), he must also have won significant numbers of Hispanic voters in districts like <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Jos%C3%A9-Rivera/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Belmont and Fordham Manor’s</a>, where the population is 73 percent Hispanic and 16 percent non-Hispanic Black but Adams got 42 percent of the vote. One potential reason: Like the Black Bloc, the True-Blue Bronx is heavily working class (18 percent of residents age 25 or older have at least a bachelor’s degree).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, New York City’s most conservative political borough, the <strong>Lands of Contradiction</strong>, is 46 percent non-Hispanic white, 26 percent Asian American, 19 percent Hispanic and only 5 percent non-Hispanic Black, but Adams still received 25 percent of first-place votes there. He was especially strong in plurality-white Assembly districts like <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Stacey-Pheffer-Amato/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard Beach’s</a> (40 percent) and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Steven-Cymbrowitz/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homecrest’s</a> (41 percent). However, Yang outran Adams in the political borough’s many plurality-Asian American neighborhoods (e.g., <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Ron-Kim/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flushing</a>), edging out Adams for first place in the Lands of Contradiction overall with 27 percent. Of note, both Yang (46 percent) and Adams (38 percent) excelled in the Assembly district that covers <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Simcha-Eichenstein/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borough Park and Midwood</a>, home of several conservative Orthodox Jewish communities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Adams finished third in the predominantly white, college-educated <strong>Elite Circles</strong>, with just 15 percent of first-place votes. Instead, the borough was split on whom it wanted to be mayor: 32 percent of voters there ranked Garcia first, while 27 percent opted for attorney Maya Wiley. But there was a clear difference between the areas that backed Garcia and the areas that backed Wiley. Garcia’s support was strongly correlated with median household income, and she topped 40 percent in each of the city’s five wealthiest Assembly districts — areas such as <a href="https://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/Dan-Quart/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midtown Manhattan</a>, the <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=067&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upper West</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Rebecca-A-Seawright/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Sides</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Jo-Anne-Simon/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downtown Brooklyn</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Wiley (the race’s premier progressive candidate) won younger, more racially diverse parts of the Elite Circles in Brooklyn and Queens — doing especially well (34 percent or more) in Assembly districts containing <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=57&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospect Heights</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Maritza-Davila/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williamsburg</a>, <a href="https://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/Emily-Gallagher/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=36&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astoria and Ditmars Steinway</a>. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that she also did well in gentrifying areas of the Crossroads, such as <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=56&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crown</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Diana-C-Richardson/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heights</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Inez-E-Dickens/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harlem</a>, where she may have paired the support of white progressives with some Black and Hispanic support. (Overall in the Crossroads, Wiley received 25 percent of first-place votes, almost as many as she got in the Elite Circles.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this means that Adams’s path to the nomination circumvented the city’s predominantly white power brokers and cultural trendsetters. Will Adams’s non-elite power base change what he attempts to do in office? On one hand, the outer boroughs and nonwhite New Yorkers may get more attention and appreciation from City Hall. On the other, Adams may struggle to establish productive relationships with the Manhattan-based media, corporations and an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/nyregion/new-york-city-council.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly progressive</a> New York City Council. (Such adversarial relationships crippled outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, and he assembled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/elections/2013/nyc-primary/mayor/map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty broad coalition</a> in his initial 2013 primary win.) If the 2021 campaign was any indication, it’s going to be an interesting next four years in New York City.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">With the release of block-level data from the 2020 census, we now have a much clearer picture of how and where the U.S. population has grown — and shrunk — over the past 10 years. And while Republicans are largely setting the terms of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting process</a> that will ensue from this announcement, the data throws a <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/redistricting/new-census-dataset-mostly-good-news-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-needed lifeline to Democrats</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not because of the country’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/census-shows-us-diversifying-white-population-shrinking-79423764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing racial diversity</a>, though. Sure, under <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current electoral coalitions</a> (where white voters are more likely to vote Republican and voters of color are more likely to vote Democratic), it’s arguably better for Democrats if the nonwhite population grows. But even in a country where only 58 percent of residents are non-Hispanic white, the 2020 presidential election was still very competitive. And electoral coalitions can change — for instance, Republicans may continue to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54972389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gain ground</a> among nonwhite voters in future elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, the good news for Democrats came in which parts of the country <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/8/17/2046167/-We-ve-got-census-growth-data-for-every-city-county-and-district-and-there-are-lots-of-surprises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained and lost population since the 2010 census</a>. Despite the country’s overall population increasing by 7.4 percent, rural areas — the reddest parts of the country — have steadily <em>lost</em> residents over the past 10 years. The average county with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight urbanization index</a> below 8<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index is a measure of how densely populated a county or county equivalent is based on the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of a given resident. The analysis in this article includes Washington, D.C., but excludes Alaska, which does not have county-equivalent-level election results available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> lost 3.1 percent of its population between 2010 and 2020. This encompasses the 1,430 most rural counties in America — 1,302 of which voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020, and only 127 of which voted for President Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, the fastest-growing parts of the country are the suburbs. The average county with an urbanization index between 11 and 13 (spanning from sparse suburban areas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_County,_Virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roanoke County, Virginia</a>, to dense suburban areas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_County,_New_Jersey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Union County, New Jersey</a>) grew by 9.6 percent between 2010 and 2020. Most of these counties (194 out of 264) voted for Biden, and if the trends of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 elections</a> continue, they will only get bluer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">America’s cities grew at a healthy rate too, which was something of a surprise compared with pre-census estimates. The 18 most urban counties or county equivalents in the country — those with a FiveThirtyEight urbanization index above 13 (including San Francisco, Philadelphia, four around Washington, D.C., and eight around New York City) — grew by an average of 8.4 percent — and all but one of them voted for Biden in 2020.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump-voting exception was Richmond County, New York, which is Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, the average county that voted for Biden boosted its population by 3.4 percent between 2010 and 2020, while the average Trump county grew by just 0.2 percent. Strikingly, 370 out of the 538 Biden counties (69 percent) gained population, while 1,468 out of the 2,574 Trump counties (57 percent) lost residents.</p>

<div><iframe title="The most rural (and reddest) counties are shrinking" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1zgkC/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="688" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These population shifts are important because they will shape the nation’s political geography for the next 10 years, as congressional district lines will be drawn based on this data. As such, it will now be that much harder to draw congressional maps that favor Republicans: If a heavily Democratic metropolitan area is overflowing with people, map-drawers need to put them <em>somewhere</em> — which may necessitate creating an extra (blue) district for that city, or at least including more blue precincts in a neighboring Republican district than the GOP would like.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the other end of the spectrum, because congressional districts must have roughly equal populations, many depopulated rural congressional districts will need to expand — either cannibalizing a neighboring rural district (which could reduce the number of safely red seats) or encroaching on the outer suburbs. Because America’s exurbs are still fairly red (three-quarters of counties with a FiveThirtyEight urbanization index between 10 and 11 voted for Trump in 2020) this could reduce the number of Republicans living in a current swing district — a sort of redistricting domino effect.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We can see how this domino effect might unfold by looking at which congressional districts, rather than counties, are over- and underpopulated. To see this, we can <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/8/16/2045702/-Morning-Digest-New-census-data-shows-which-districts-will-have-to-grow-or-shrink-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compare the 2020 population of each current district</a> to what its population should look like after the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reapportionment process</a>. (Remember, because each state’s districts must have the same population, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VsWXBX_cVFcfaxHdlAMzzhJYRWgayzWxsJ3rdOlO-24/edit#gid=1761243994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target population</a> of a state’s districts is the state’s 2020 population divided by the number of congressional districts it received in reapportionment.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the map below, orange districts will need to add population (i.e., they will need to expand), while purple ones will need to lose population (i.e., they will need to get smaller).</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Where congressional districts could shrink or grow" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lEddh/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="555" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The most obvious examples of districts that will need to expand are those in states that lost a seat in reapportionment, like West Virginia. But take a look at New York, which also lost a seat. The districts that will need to expand the most are all in upstate New York, while four New York City-based districts — the 5th, 8th, 10th and 12th — will actually need to <em>shed</em> residents. Since those districts are all extremely blue, that will provide mapmakers with an opportunity to add Democratic votes to nearby districts that might not be as safe, such as the 11th. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, in Illinois, the districts around Chicago are those that are already closest to their target post-redistricting population, whereas the downstate 12th and 17th will need to add the most people. And because Illinois also lost a seat in reapportionment, it’s most likely that downstate will lose representation. Since five of Illinois’s six current downstate representatives are Republicans (and Democrats control the map-drawing process in Illinois), that makes it a safe bet that Republicans will draw the short straw. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, patterns in population growth could blunt Republican gains as well. For example, the two most overpopulated current districts in North Carolina — which is gaining a seat — are the deep-blue 2nd (which covers Raleigh) and 12th (which covers Charlotte). Republicans are in charge of redistricting in North Carolina, but they would have to engage in some complicated gerrymandering gymnastics if they want to blunt the political power of these metro areas. Similarly, the Cook Political Report’s Dave Wasserman has <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/redistricting/new-census-dataset-mostly-good-news-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that explosive population growth in urban areas like Austin could limit Texas Republicans to a map where Republicans have the advantage in only 25 of the state’s now-38 districts, whereas previously they might have been able to draw 27 Republican-leaning seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, as Wasserman’s estimate makes clear, the population trends from the 2020 census are not enough to cancel out any gerrymandering efforts. Rather, the census numbers are merely a silver lining for Democrats. They still remain at a serious disadvantage in the 2021 redistricting cycle simply because Republicans will control the redrawing of more congressional districts. Republicans will have full control over the redrawing of 43 percent of congressional districts, and Democrats will have full control over the redrawing of just 17 percent. (Neither party enjoys full control of redistricting for 38 percent of districts, while the remaining 1 percent are at-large districts and won’t be redrawn at all.) </p>

As long as redistricting remains such a subjective process, who draws the maps will remain more important than the underlying data.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this month, right before senators departed for their summer recess, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-the-people-act-voting-rights-bill-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made an 11th-hour plea</a> to his colleagues to take up the omnibus voting rights bill, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For the People Act</a>. But Republicans once again <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/11/ted-cruz-voting-bill-congress-democrats-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped that from happening</a>. They also blocked two other provisions Schumer tried to put forward on voting rights — one bill that would have addressed partisan gerrymandering and another bill that tackled campaign finance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, Democrats know that Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-wont-support-sweeping-voting-rights-legislation-now-or-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are unlikely to support</a> sweeping voting rights legislation. After all, Republicans in the last few months have twice <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-wont-support-sweeping-voting-rights-legislation-now-or-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked consideration</a> of the For the People Act and have shown little appetite for negotiation, even scuttling West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/manchin-policy-demands-election-legislation-4b7454d5-eb83-4003-9044-81830add1d30.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compromise bill</a>. But that won’t stop Democrats from trying to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voting-rights-senate-adjourns/2021/08/11/f2e19620-fa3c-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take up voting legislation again</a> in September. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The text of this newest bill isn’t public yet, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/biden-democrats-voting-rights.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will reportedly be</a> a scaled-down version of the For the People Act and modeled after Manchin’s bill. It’s likely, though, that this bill will also fail. That’s in part because voting rights have become an intractable fight between the two parties: Democratic and Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/22/republicans-and-democrats-move-further-apart-in-views-of-voting-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view voting access fundamentally differently</a>. Polls do suggest that there is at least some appetite among Americans to make <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_062121/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain aspects of voting easier</a>, but whether Democrats can use that to their advantage and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/biden-democrats-voting-rights.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a moral argument</a> in favor of the government working to uphold democratic values, like voting rights, remains an open question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also a risky strategy for Democrats because there is no fail-safe plan if they fail to win over their Republican colleagues on this new bill. One final option might be to modify <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/14/biden-must-make-case-ending-filibuster-protect-voting-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or eliminate the filibuster</a>, but that, too, is a tall task for Democrats. That’s because while a majority of Democratic senators <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/filibuster-vote-count/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are in favor</a> of changes to the filibuster to pass something on voting rights, not all members are. Notably, Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/07/manchin-sinema-fillibuster-horror-film.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staunchly opposed</a> to eliminating the filibuster and also hesitant to make any tweaks to it. Manchin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/joe-manchin-filibuster-stimulus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at one point</a> said he was open to a so-called “talking filibuster,” where senators wanting to block legislation would have to speak continuously on the Senate floor in order to maintain a filibuster, but it’s unclear whether that change would be taken up. More tellingly, Manchin <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1372223248415481862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> several ideas floated by proponents of filibuster reform in March. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just Democratic holdouts in the Senate. Polls also show that Americans are largely opposed to abolishing the filibuster outright. According to <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_042921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an April Monmouth University poll</a>, just 19 percent of U.S. adults said Congress should get rid of the filibuster entirely versus 38 percent who said Congress should keep it as is. Voters were open to tweaks, with 38 percent of respondents telling Monmouth they were open to keeping but reforming the filibuster. Similarly, when a group of voters in <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/06/09/senate-filibuster-popularity-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult’s June survey</a> were given a choice between passing legislation with a simple majority or with a 60-vote threshold, 45 percent favored tweaking the filibuster to a simple majority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s troubling for Democrats is that those attitudes on filibuster reform barely shifted when respondents were asked about voting rights specifically, despite the fact that the filibuster has long been used to <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block civil rights legislation</a>. That April Monmouth poll found, for instance, that Americans were evenly split on amending the filibuster specifically for voting legislation: Forty-six percent of respondents said they supported<em> </em>using the filibuster to block federal bills on election rules and voting rights, while another 46 percent said they were opposed. Another <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/25/22347322/filibuster-voting-rights-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vox/Data for Progress</a> poll found pretty much the same thing: Fifty-two percent of likely voters either strongly or somewhat supported a change in Senate rules to pass the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/people-act-separating-fact-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For the People Act</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while gutting the filibuster entirely or even tweaking it might be a hard sell for Democrats, Americans are broadly in favor of certain other measures that would make it easier to vote. And according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/biden-democrats-voting-rights.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, the newest voting bill is expected to include several of these provisions, such as mandating 15 days of early, in-person voting, including at least two Sundays; expanding vote-by-mail; ending partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts; and creating a national voter ID requirement. According to an April survey from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/22/republicans-and-democrats-move-further-apart-in-views-of-voting-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, 63 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, as well as 91 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, supported making early, in-person voting available to voters at least two weeks prior to Election Day. A <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_062121/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June Monmouth University poll</a> also found bipartisan support for making early voting easier, with 89 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of Republicans in favor. And according to that Pew survey, voter ID laws were also incredibly popular among both Democrats and Republicans, with 61 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners and 93 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners supporting requiring all voters to show government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, just because something is popular with Republican voters doesn’t mean Republicans in Congress will back it — after all, we saw that happen <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-bidens-covid-19-relief-bill-help-democrats-avoid-a-midterm-defeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the COVID-19 stimulus package earlier this year</a>. And Republicans so far have shown little interest in passing <em>any</em> type of voting legislation at the federal level. In fact, when Schumer tried to get the chamber to debate voting rights proposals earlier this month, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/11/ted-cruz-voting-bill-congress-democrats-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Democrats of</a> trying to “strike down virtually every reasonable voter integrity law in the country.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, GOP politicians appear more focused on ensuring no one who is not eligible to vote votes rather than expanding access to the ballot. Just consider the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-have-made-it-harder-to-vote-in-11-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of restrictive voting bills</a> being passed by GOP-controlled legislatures at the state level. This, though, could be dangerous for Republicans. They gained among <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black men and Hispanic Americans in 2020</a>, but if the perception among these voters that Republicans <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t want people like them to vote</a> grows, that could negatively impact their overall opinion of the GOP. Moreover, Black and Hispanic voters are the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/georgias-proposed-voting-restrictions-will-harm-black-voters-most" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two groups of voters</a> most likely <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/racist-latino-vote-accelerates-texas-republicans-seek-restrictions-rcna1546" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be adversely affected</a> by restrictive voting bills at the state level.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, though, one of the biggest reasons why compromise between the two parties is so unlikely is because Republicans and Democrats view voting rights differently. And polls show a huge partisan split on whether voting is a privilege or a fundamental right. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/22/wide-partisan-divide-on-whether-voting-is-a-fundamental-right-or-a-privilege-with-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July report from Pew</a>, an overwhelming majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (78 percent) said that they view voting as a “fundamental right” for every U.S. citizen, while only 32 percent of Republican and Republican leaners felt the same. Instead, Republicans are more likely to view voting as a privilege that can be limited (67 percent of Republican and Republican leaners felt this way, versus 21 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners). There’s a racial divide here, too, with Black (77 percent), Hispanic (63 percent) and Asian Americans (66 percent) being far more likely than white Americans (51 percent) to say voting is a fundamental right.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian American adults were interviewed in English only, according to Pew, while white, Black and Asian American adults included those who said they’re one race and not Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> Bottom line: Democrats are much more likely than Republicans (70 percent to 32 percent, according to a June <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/06/09050746/210636_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> poll) to think restricting voting access is a major threat to American democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So because of all this, it’s highly unlikely Republicans and Democrats will meet in the middle on voting rights legislation this fall. Of course, if Republicans again stymie Democratic efforts to debate a voting rights bill next month, Democrats might have enough ammo to tweak the filibuster. But even that might have negative political repercussions for Democrats. That’s because both Democratic voters and elected officials don’t yet have a huge appetite for changing the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. All of this means that Democrats are likely to keep facing an uphill climb in enacting legislation to protect and expand voting access. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Mack Bair, 24, supports same-sex marriage. Matthew C., 22, backs marijuana legalization and Luke T., 22, is solidly pro-abortion rights, (both of whom asked to not use their last names out of fear of retribution for their political views). John Henke, 20, says he believes climate change is happening — and that humans are playing a role. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first blush, these young men might seem like progressive voters. But they’re not: All four voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020 and, for those old enough, in 2016 as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They’re all also part of Generation Z, America’s youngest adult generation, which is more <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethnically and racially diverse</a> than any generation before it.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pew Research Center defines Gen Zers&lt;/a&gt; as those born from 1997 onward, though children born in 2010 and after &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/gen-meet-gen-alpha-generation-born-2010-today/story?id=68971965" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;qualify for Generation Alpha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> And similar to millennials, who are now in their <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mid-20s to early 40s</a>, members of Gen Z <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more liberal on a number of key social issues</a> than older generations. According to Pew’s 2020 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verified voter survey</a>, millennials and Gen Zers also backed Biden over Trump in that year’s election, by a 20-point margin.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pew told FiveThirtyEight that they did not have a large enough sample to share the vote choice for just Gen-Z voters, who, per Pew, made up just 8 percent of the electorate in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the generation’s overall progressive bent, this hasn’t translated into overwhelming Democratic support. In fact, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/11/gen-z-politics-2020-poll-takeaways-426767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some research suggests</a> that Gen Zers are no more likely to identify as members of the Democratic Party than registered voters in the overall electorate, and a plurality are unwilling to identify with either political party. That means that, despite their overwhelming support of Biden in the presidential election, there is also a small — but, so far, solid — chunk of Gen Z that identifies as Republican. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To better understand who these voters are and what motivates them to align with a party that has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/386791-mcconnell-i-wont-support-legalizing-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remained</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-change-and-republicans-congress-global-warming-2019-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/12/anti-abortion-activists-womens-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on many issues</a> important to Gen Z, I looked at polling data and political science for clues. I also spoke with six Gen-Z voters who voted for Trump and either identify as Republican or lean Republican. What I learned is that most of them break with the mainstream of the Republican Party on many social and cultural issues, but solidly agree with the GOP’s <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/do-republican-economic-policies-work-4129139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stances on the economy</a>. They also think the Democratic Party, as it is now, has veered too far left, specifically with its stances on immigration, gun control and race. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“When it comes to Gen-Z Republicans, I think folks need to understand that we don’t fit neatly in a box and I think that boggles the media,” said Javon Price, 23, a self-described conservative Republican who spoke in his personal capacity but works as a policy analyst for <a href="https://americafirstpolicy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the America First Policy Institute</a>, a nonprofit group <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-policy-institute-brooke-rollins-bac3f2f8-b41a-45a6-a962-aeb126a38d0e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allied with Trump</a> that promotes the former president’s policies. “We’re normal everyday people like everybody else, and political beliefs aren’t the end-all be-all.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans in this generation are more likely to take what they call “libertarian” approaches to social issues like same-sex marriage, and surveys show that these young Republicans are more likely to care <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-cancel-culture-became-an-issue-for-young-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about “cancel culture”</a> than the electorate as a whole. They’re also <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/civic-and-political-attitudes-young-white-men" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly white and male</a>. But despite being more liberal on social issues than older Republicans, most of the young Republicans I spoke with admitted to me that they don’t see themselves ever leaving the GOP. And if Trump runs for president in 2024 and wins his party’s primary, most also said they would vote for him again. Even so, many of them are not too far behind their Democratic peers on a number of social issues, according to polling analysis as well as interviews with these young voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling from <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/nationscape" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape</a> found that both Democrats and Republicans in this generation, ages 18-24, have favorable opinions of people who are LGBTQ (83 percent of young Democrats have a favorable view compared with 66 percent of young Republicans) and support legalizing marijuana (67 percent of young Democrats compared to 55 percent of young Republicans). The gap between Democratic and Republican Gen Zers is also fairly small when it comes to separating children from their parents at the border when their parents could be prosecuted for illegally entering the U.S., with just 7 percent of young Democrats and 26 percent of young Republicans agreeing with that policy.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1760" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-1-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-1-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-1-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-1-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The fact that young Republicans aren’t that different from their Democratic peers on some social issues is largely on par with what academic research and studies from Pew have found, though not all social issues were as cut-and-dried. For example, even though two-thirds of Gen Zers <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/08/15/poll_gen_z_spurs_shift_in_voter_support_for_gun_control__141014.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">want stricter gun measures</a>, according to Rasmussen Reports survey data, young Republicans are still far less likely than young Democrats to want to ban assault rifles, according to Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape. One of the Republican men I spoke with said gun rights had even become a barometer for how he judges political candidates. “If you know somebody’s opinion on gun rights, you can make a pretty educated guess as to where they stand on every other issue — even unrelated ones,” Stephan Kapustka, 22, told me.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-2020-census-good-news-democrats-nate-silver-79467274</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Abortion may be another issue like this. Although the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape polling showed that a majority of Gen Zers from each party said they believe at least some abortions should be permitted — and only 16 percent of young Democrats and 33 percent of young Republicans said abortions should <em>never </em>be permitted — the issue divided the men I spoke with. For example, Price, who voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020, is strongly anti-abortion. Regarding his childhood neighborhood outside of Newark, New Jersey, he told me, “I could more easily find a Planned Parenthood than I could a park.” Henke, who is Christian, agreed; during a separate phone call, he said he used to take a more hands-off stance toward abortion, but switched to an anti-abortion stance after talking with his pastor. Matthew C., meanwhile, told me he’s pro-abortion rights. Overall, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246278/abortion-trends-party.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few Republicans want to outright ban abortion</a>, but this is one social issue where young Republicans appear to be closer to the opinions of their elders in the party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the biggest gaps between Gen-Z Republicans and Democrats aren’t on social issues. It’s how they view issues of economic and foreign policy. And for many young Republicans, that’s what’s driving their support of the GOP. For example, Gen-Z Democrats are way more likely than Gen-Z Republicans to support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour (79 percent for young Democrats compared with 43 percent for young Republicans), cutting taxes for families that make less than $100,000 a year (69 percent compared with 43 percent) and raising taxes for families that make over $600,000 a year (70 percent compared with 38 percent).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1256" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“A lot of us are very financially motivated, and maybe that’s because we grew up in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-guide-to-the-financial-crisis--10-years-later/2018/09/10/114b76ba-af10-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Great Recession</a>,” Henke told me. “I was raised to be financially responsible because my parents started with pretty much nothing and now they’re both pretty successful. They’ve taught me and my family to be fiscally responsible, and that’s the biggest thing that motivates me.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, even though the Democratic Party is closer in line with where some of these Gen-Z Republicans stand on social issues, it might be economic policy — plus opposition to abortion and gun control — that has a bigger hold on them. Some of Trump’s more populist messaging around “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/525551816/trumps-efforts-to-drain-the-swamp-lagging-behind-his-campaign-rhetoric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draining the swamp</a>” has also resonated with them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[Trump] made me really proud to be an American and made me feel like the American Dream is alive and well,” Luke T. said. “He did a really good job of grabbing hold of people’s frustration with the establishment, and I liked that he was an outsider, rather than a traditional Republican.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just the economy and Trump that has made these young voters loyal to the GOP. Kapustka told me he’s open to more left-leaning views on social issues, but that he’s had conversations with his fellow Republican friends who think that “the Democrats don’t really care about them because they’re evil, white males or something like that.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Data and interviews with Gen-Z Republicans illustrate a cap on young Republicans’ more socially liberal views, particularly as it pertains to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-attacking-cancel-culture-and-woke-people-is-becoming-the-gops-new-political-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent political fights</a> over “cancel culture” and how socially progressive or “woke” Americans should be. For instance, polling from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape found that over half (55 percent) of Gen-Z Republicans believe we should end the practice of shaming people who say things that aren’t politically correct, versus 38 percent of Gen-Z Democrats who believe the same. This could be related to research that suggests Republicans are more likely than Democrats to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-did-republicans-outperform-the-polls-again-two-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say that they self-censor their political views</a> due to fear of judgment for what they believe. “Shutting people down or attacking them on Twitter seems to be a new thing,” Matthew C. told me. “And I think ‘cancel culture’ is horrible. I grew up around social media and the internet, and they both can be very toxic.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, political science research suggests that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">young voters are shaped</a> by what happens in their late adolescence and early adult years, so if there is a fear among younger Republicans that voicing their political views risks retribution, it could explain in part why <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-republicans-are-happy-to-stoke-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent GOP culture-war issues</a> have played such a role in shaping these voters’ political consciousness. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, there’s still <em>a lot </em>we don’t know about Gen Z as a whole because they make up <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10 percent</a> of the electorate. Moreover, most of what we do know is limited to how they voted in the past one or two presidential races. But it’s possible that, over time, Gen-Z Republicans won’t be a political minority. There’s already <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/706889" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some evidence</a> that today’s younger liberals might get more conservative as they get older, and <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-gops-gen-z-problem-and-path-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly one-third</a> of Gen-Z voters who don’t identify as Republican said that they would consider voting for a moderate Republican candidate, according to a June 2020 survey by the Niskanen Center. For now, though, young Republicans are just a small slice of the electorate, but as long as the party sticks to its roots — or, its founding principles of small government and free enterprise — it’s unlikely these voters are going anywhere anytime soon. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, we laid out the uncertainty over <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the American public would react</a> to the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. Since then, several polls have been conducted and released that take into account last weekend’s turmoil, and a tentative picture is emerging: Americans are upset about how the withdrawal of U.S. troops has unfolded, and they are eager to see the U.S. help clean up the mess. But Americans are also fickle — even self-contradictory — when it comes to foreign policy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, only 25 percent of registered voters believed the Afghanistan withdrawal was going very or somewhat well, and 57 percent thought it was going not too well or not well at all, according to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/16/afghanistan-withdrawal-taliban-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> poll conducted Aug. 13-16, as Kabul was falling to the Taliban. And Americans largely blame President Biden for this: A subsequent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/19/afghanistan-withdrawal-blame-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> poll, conducted Aug. 16-19, found that 43 percent of registered voters thought Biden held a great deal of responsibility for the situation — more than Congress or any of Biden’s three predecessors, who all clocked in at 24 to 27 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other polling agrees that the public is unhappy with Biden’s handling of the Afghanistan War. Morning Consult/Politico’s Aug. 13-16 poll found that voters disapproved of his handling of Afghanistan, 51 percent to 31 percent. In a poll fielded Aug. 14-17, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/oacaip2ls4/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a> found a similar result among all adults, with Biden receiving a 42 percent disapproval and 32 percent approval rating on his handling of the war. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Even the best poll for Biden gave him a middling score. An <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/lbvgnnggapq/Afghanistan_Snap_Topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos/Reuters</a> survey conducted on Aug. 16 found that 44 percent of adults thought the Biden administration had done a good job on Afghanistan, while 42 percent thought it had done a bad job. His three immediate predecessors — George W. Bush (47 percent good, 39 percent bad), Barack Obama (51 percent good, 38 percent bad) and Donald Trump (51 percent good, 36 percent bad) — all got better, though not stellar, grades.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the bigger picture, Biden’s net approval rating is also at its lowest point in his presidency, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average</a>: 49.1 percent approval, 44.5 percent disapproval. This may well be partially due to the news in Afghanistan: For instance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos/Reuters</a> found that Biden’s approval rating dropped sharply — 7 percentage points — between Friday, Aug. 13, and Monday, Aug. 16. However, Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was slipping even before</a> the Taliban took over, so it’s also clear that Afghanistan isn’t the only factor at play here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The grim headlines have also made some Americans rethink their support for withdrawing troops at all. As my colleague Geoffrey Skelley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on Monday</a>, net support for withdrawal was extremely high before last weekend: between +28 and +46 points. But five polls conducted since Aug. 13<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned Morning Consult, Morning Consult/Politico and YouGov/The Economist polls, plus one poll each from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/20210817_US_JohnZogby.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;John Zogby Strategies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/8/17/voters-support-withdrawing-troops-from-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Data for Progress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> all showed support for withdrawal dropping to between 45 and 53 percent, while opposition had risen to between 32 and 37 percent. Notably, of course, this still means more Americans support withdrawal than oppose it, by 12- to 17-point margins.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a caveat: How pollsters word their questions can change the poll’s results. For instance, when YouGov/The Economist asked, “Do you think the United States made a mistake by recently withdrawing troops from Afghanistan?,” Americans were divided: 33 percent said yes, 36 percent said no and 31 percent weren’t sure. Similarly, when Morning Consult/Politico asked, “​​Do you believe the U.S. should still withdraw its military presence in Afghanistan if it means the Taliban regains control of most of Afghanistan?” — something that has indeed come to pass — only 38 percent of registered voters responded that troops should still withdraw, while 45 percent said that they should not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And sometimes, respondents outright contradicted themselves. In the Ipsos/Reuters poll, Americans supported completing the withdrawal of troops on schedule, 61 percent to 25 percent. But they also said, 50 percent to 36 percent, that they supported “sending combat troops back into Afghanistan to fight the Taliban.” Likewise, 68 percent of adults agreed with the statement that the war was going to end badly no matter when the U.S. left, while only 18 percent disagreed. But the same respondents also agreed, 51 percent to 32 percent, with the statement that “it would have been worth it for the United States to leave troops in Afghanistan for another year.” These conflicting results might reflect <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/26/will-foreign-policy-be-a-major-issue-in-the-2016-election-heres-what-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how little Americans know about foreign policy</a> and how, until recently, they spent <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-domestic-political-fallout-from-the-afghanistan-war-is-so-hard-to-assess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very little time thinking about Afghanistan as an issue</a>. (As a result, voters often need to <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo5514391.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn to political leaders for guidance on issues of foreign policy</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One thing that does come across clearly in the polls, though, is Americans’ desire to address the humanitarian crisis that has arisen because of the Taliban takeover. Polls found extremely strong support for helping Afghans whose lives are now in danger. In the Ipsos/Reuters poll, 73 percent of adults supported evacuating Afghans who aided American troops and bringing them to the U.S., while just 16 percent were opposed. And Americans were also willing to deploy American troops to hold off the Taliban so that such an evacuation could take place, 68 percent to 18 percent. According to a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/8/17/voters-support-withdrawing-troops-from-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data for Progress</a> poll fielded Aug. 13-16, Americans also favor speeding up the visa process so that Afghans can resettle in the U.S., 55 percent to 30 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the same vein, a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2021/08/17/fcdbe/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> survey on Aug. 17 found that 65 percent of U.S. adults supported accepting Afghans who worked for “U.S.-based news organizations, U.S.-based aid and development agencies and other relief groups that receive U.S. funding” as refugees into the U.S.; only 15 percent were opposed. When <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2021/08/18/61982/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> asked people the following day about resettling Afghan refugees in “your own state,” 61 percent supported it and 19 percent opposed it — a very similar margin, though it does seem like a few Americans are OK with accepting refugees in general but don’t want them in their area. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given how some nativist Republicans are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/afghan-refugees-republicans/2021/08/18/3592aaa0-005e-11ec-825d-01701f9ded64_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stoking fears around the idea of accepting refugees</a>, though, it’s worth watching to see if these numbers change. Morning Consult’s Aug. 16-19 poll revealed that support for evacuating Afghans into the U.S. was lower when respondents were offered the option to evacuate Afghans to somewhere other than the U.S. While 42 percent of registered voters liked the idea of the U.S. both evacuating Afghans and offering them refugee status, 28 percent wanted the U.S. to evacuate them but not offer them refugee status. (An additional 11 percent did not want the U.S. to assist with evacuations at all.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, the American withdrawal and the Taliban takeover mark the final chapter of a war with a mixed legacy among the American public. The war started with a public mandate: In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, upward of 90 percent of the public thought the U.S. was right to intervene in Afghanistan, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/352793/americans-split-whether-afghanistan-war-mistake.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a>. But the share who felt the war was a mistake steadily increased over the next decade. And now, per YouGov/The Economist, 38 percent of Americans thought the U.S. made a mistake deploying troops to fight in Afghanistan, and only 28 percent did not think it was a mistake (although a relatively high 34 percent weren’t sure). An Aug. 12-16 survey from the <a href="https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Afghanistan-topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> also reported that Americans now feel the war in Afghanistan was not worth fighting, 62 percent to 35 percent — making it essentially as unpopular as the war in Iraq. And a separate <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2021/08/17/fcdbe/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> poll from Aug. 17 found that only 6 percent of Americans felt that the U.S. won the war in Afghanistan; 38 percent felt that we had lost it, while 39 percent thought we had neither won nor lost. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps most damningly, Americans were deeply ambivalent about whether the war had accomplished any good for the Afghan people. Per <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2021/08/17/fcdbe/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a>, 26 percent of Americans thought it made life better for Afghans, 23 percent thought it made life worse and 27 percent thought it didn’t make life either better or worse. Twenty-four percent didn’t know.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Of the three gubernatorial elections taking place in 2021, New Jersey’s has flown under the radar. And a new <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_NJ_081821/">Monmouth University</a> poll underscores why: It isn’t shaping up to be very competitive. In an average of Monmouth’s two likely voter models, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy took 53 percent, while Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli took 38 percent. If Murphy wins, he’ll be the first Democrat reelected as New Jersey governor since 1977.</li><li>Marijuana usage in the U.S. has reached a new … high. According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/353645/nearly-half-adults-tried-marijuana.aspx">Gallup</a>, 49 percent of adults admit to having tried marijuana at some point in their lives. That number had steadily crept up from 4 percent in 1969 to the previous record of 45 percent in both 2017 and 2019.</li><li>A new poll from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/08/17/dc-move-pandemic-poll/">The Washington Post/Schar School of Policy and Government</a> found that 23 percent of metro Washington, D.C., residents had seriously considered moving to a new community since the start of the pandemic. However, only 15 percent have actually moved homes, and two-thirds of those said their reasons for moving were not related to the coronavirus.</li><li>Last week, actor and neuroscientist Mayim Bialik and “Jeopardy!” executive producer Mike Richards were named the two new hosts of the beloved quiz show, with Bialik overseeing primetime specials and Richards helming the flagship program. According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/17/new-jeopardy-hosts-poll/">Morning Consult</a>, viewers approved of Bialik’s casting 70 percent to 9 percent — but Richards received just 47 percent to 16 percent approval/disapproval, with 37 percent reserving judgment (the poll was conducted before The Ringer <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/8/18/22631299/mike-richards-jeopardy-host-search-process-past-comments">reported on allegations</a> that Richards had used sexist and demeaning language). Of all the guest hosts who tried out for the show, Bialik was the second-most popular choice (with 13 percent of respondents choosing her as their favorite), while Richards was tied for seventh (with 3 percent). America’s preferred replacement for the legendary Alex Trebek was actor LeVar Burton (16 percent) — jibing with the fact that more than 267,000 people advocated for him in an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sony-pictures-entertainment-levar-burton-should-be-the-next-host-of-jeopardy">online petition</a>.</li><li>On Sunday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the country would hold its next federal election on Sept. 20. According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s and Éric Grenier’s <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/">Poll Tracker</a> — a weighted average of Canadian election polls similar to FiveThirtyEight’s — Trudeau’s Liberals currently lead in that campaign, with 35 percent of the vote. The Conservative Party garners 29 percent, and the New Democratic Party sits at 20 percent.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Aug. 12, the U.S. Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/2020-census-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released detailed redistricting data</a> that states will use to draw their congressional lines. These new maps are important because they will not only help determine <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which party has an advantage moving into the 2022 midterms</a>, but also influence whether members of the U.S. House of Representatives seek reelection, run for another office or leave political life entirely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, complications from redistricting may have influenced two Democratic House members in highly competitive seats to announce their exits recently, portending trouble for their party in next year’s midterm elections. Perhaps most notably, longtime Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/10/kind-reelection-503343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced on Aug. 10 that he wouldn’t seek reelection</a>. With Kind retiring, it will be challenging for Democrats to hold on to his rural, western Wisconsin seat, which is about 9 percentage points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric</a>.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> And in Pennsylvania, Rep. Conor Lamb, a relative newcomer, is leaving his Pittsburgh-area seat, which is 2 points more Republican than the country as a whole. This district could be a tough one for Democrats to retain, especially if redistricting makes his seat even more Republican. Lamb’s motivations are different from Kind’s, however: Lamb is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/us/politics/conor-lamb-senate-race-pa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running for retiring Republican Pat Toomey’s seat in the Senate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, House Democrats are sitting out reelection for numerous reasons, but it’s an important thing to track, as retirements and runs for other offices can hint at what members expect the midterm landscape to look like. Take the 2018 midterm cycle, when about two times as many House Republicans as Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/here-are-all-the-republicans-retiring-from-congress-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to leave office</a> ahead of that year’s “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-it-was-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blue wave</a>.” And while House Democrats are currently nowhere near the 39 Republicans who threw in the towel before the 2018 election, these departures are still an early warning for them, especially considering Democrats hold a narrow 222-to-213 seat majority,<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This count includes &lt;a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Members#Vacancies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;three vacancies in seats&lt;/a&gt; that are safe for one party or the other &amp;#8212; two formerly Democratic-held seats and one formerly Republican-held seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>10</sup></a> meaning Republicans need a net gain of just five seats to capture the chamber. The fact that Democrats may be in trouble shouldn’t come as a surprise, though, since the president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-2020-gains-in-the-house-set-them-up-well-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually loses ground in midterm House elections</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, 16 representatives have announced their departures,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> but in another ominous sign for Democrats, the type of seats the two parties are leaving open differs dramatically, as the table below shows. Seven of the eight outgoing Democrats represent districts that are less than 5 points more Democratic than the country as a whole — including the seats held by Kind and Lamb — which could make those seats easier for the GOP to flip next year. By comparison, only one Republican is leaving a seat that’s less than 10 points more Republican, meaning retirements and departures from office haven’t left the GOP as exposed.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, more Democrats (four) than Republicans (two) have announced they aren’t running for reelection or seeking another office — what we call “pure” retirements — and while it’s still early, a continuation of that trend would be another indication that Democrats are concerned about the midterm environment. Indeed, there’s been a tendency in midterm years for the president’s party to have <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/exit-stage-left-or-right-midterm-retirements-and-open-seats-in-the-u-s-house-from-1974-to-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more pure retirements</a> than the out-of-office party. And at this point, the pure retirements for Republicans have more to do with scandal (in the case of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/21/politics/tom-reed-sexual-misconduct-allegation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Rep. Tom Reed</a>, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct) or the loss of ranking member status <a href="https://www.congressionalinstitute.org/2019/10/23/time-for-house-republicans-to-reform-term-limit-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to GOP term limits</a> on leadership posts (in the case of <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/14/kevin-brady-congress-texas-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Rep. Kevin Brady</a>), and less to do with redistricting woes.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-2020-census-good-news-democrats-nate-silver-79467274</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">As noted earlier — as well as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/only-11-house-members-have-said-theyre-not-running-again-heres-why-thats-important-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in May</a> — concerns about redistricting have certainly played a role in many of the Democratic departures, such as those of Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Texas Rep. Filemón Vela. And take again Democrats’ most recent departures, Kind and Lamb. Even though they don’t hail from states where the GOP alone controls redistricting (it’s split partisan control in both states), they too may be worried about redistricting. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Elections/2020-us-house-election-results-live-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Each barely won reelection in 2020,</a> and new district lines to fortify their chances of winning again aren’t a safe bet given that certain geographical realities make it unlikely that their seats get much bluer. For instance, Kind’s 3rd Congressional District in Wisconsin <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/wisconsin-decisive-again-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has swung sharply to the right</a> in recent years, and three of the four districts it borders in the state are solidly GOP-leaning, so unless the district absorbs Democratic-leaning turf near the deep-blue city of Madison, new lines aren’t likely to make the R+9 seat significantly more Democratic. Meanwhile, it might not appear that Lamb is abandoning ship by running for Senate, but Pennsylvania as a whole is about R+3 and could end up being more Democratic than Lamb’s district after new lines are drawn. That’s because Pennsylvania will lose one district in reapportionment, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VsWXBX_cVFcfaxHdlAMzzhJYRWgayzWxsJ3rdOlO-24/edit#gid=1761243994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so the remaining districts must add population</a>, including Lamb’s 17th Congressional District, which is already R+2. That could <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-redistricting-congressional-map-20210427.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessitate adding population from GOP-leaning turf</a> in nearby districts, and/or Lamb’s district could also lose some of its more Democratic-leaning areas to the Pittsburgh-based 18th Congressional District, too, which needs to add even more population than the 17th District does.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to overstate the impact redistricting might have on Democrats deciding to leave the House. Overall, Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will draw lines for about 2.5 times as many seats as Democrats</a>. Republicans will draw the lines in four of the eight Democratic open seats, and in six of the eight Republican open seats. This means that four Democratic representatives — Ryan and Vela as well as Florida’s Charlie Crist and Val Demings — won’t be defending seats next year in states where Republicans control redistricting. And outside of Demings, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/politics/val-demings-announces-senate-campaign/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has launched a Senate campaign</a> to challenge Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, the other three represent competitive districts that could become more GOP-leaning. (Only Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick’s Arizona seat will be drawn by a commission.) Conversely, Democrats will draw lines for only two of the GOP-held seats — those of New York Reps. Lee Zeldin and Reed — as well as retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos’s district in Illinois. That could enable Democrats <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-state/where-democrats-draw-line.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pick up Zeldin’s district</a> — Reed’s district <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1427389029562077188?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is more likely</a> to become a GOP <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2011/5/4/972944/-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote sink</a> — and also maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1426670332837076997?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect Bustos’s seat</a>, but they simply have fewer opportunities to redraw districts in their favor than the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bottom line: At this point, the departure of members like Kind and Lamb makes it harder for Democrats to hold on to potentially competitive House seats, and the overall picture has worsened for Democrats as more of their vulnerable members exit the House. While these developments are not yet a death blow to Democrats’ chances of retaining their House majority, they do signal how tough it will be for Democrats to hold off Republicans next year. Redistricting, along with the classic penalty for the president’s party in midterm elections, could put Democrats in a pretty big hole.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): In April, President Biden announced that it was time to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/us/politics/biden-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end the “forever” war in Afghanistan</a> by sending home the roughly 2,500 Americans troops that remained there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It wasn’t apparent at the time, but that decision now appears to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/us/politics/afghanistan-biden-administration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set in motion the collapse of the Afghan government</a>. Over the weekend, the Taliban, the ousted militant group that came to power in the country in the mid-1990s, seized control of the capital, weeks before the U.S. was set to withdraw its remaining troops.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Afghanistan War has spanned four presidencies now, so it’s hard to blame Biden entirely for what’s happened there (and it’s not clear at this point that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans will</a>). But Biden’s exit strategy certainly has <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/08/15/war-veterans-families-afghanistan-united-states-government/8143821002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people asking what the last 20 years were for</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-ending-war-afghanistan-79488089</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s talk about how the Afghanistan War became a 20-year conflict in the first place; how Americans feel about the Afghanistan War and whether Americans’ thoughts on war are changing; and finally, the potential domestic political repercussions of the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, how did the war last for 20 years? And how different were our perceptions of the war from what was happening on the ground?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal</strong> (Tanisha Fazal, professor of political science at the University of Minnesota): One reason the war lasted as long as it has is because most Americans don’t grasp the costs of war. Less than 1 percent of the population <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-percentage-of-americans-have-served-in-the-military/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serves in the military</a>, meaning most people don’t know someone who serves. The human costs of war have also changed. U.S. military medicine has <a href="https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/65/1/160/5905233?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved dramatically over time</a>, especially since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. What this means is that most U.S. casualties today are nonfatal casualties, so a lot of the human consequences of war are less visible to Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also, the way the U.S. pays for war has changed. As political scientist Sarah Kreps has written, we <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/taxing-wars-9780190865306?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used to finance wars via taxes</a>, but today, we finance wars by adding to the national debt. Put all this together, and you have a very small group paying the most immediate, visible costs of war. The rest of us are also paying those costs, but they’re much harder to see.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky</strong> (Adam Berinsky, professor of political science at MIT): As a public opinion scholar, I would also add that ongoing military action — even war — just isn’t something that’s super important to most Americans. We saw this <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/18097/iraq-versus-vietnam-comparison-public-opinion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Iraq War</a>, and it was true with Afghanistan as well. This kept a lot of things that were happening in Afghanistan off the American public’s radar.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> Consider, too, that the military is now an all-volunteer force. There was a draft for the Vietnam War, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/vietnam-war/draft-picker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring many young men to serve</a>, which is at least one reason why that war <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/opinion/vietnam-antiwar-movement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw so many protests</a> compared to <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-america/2018-08-20/united-states-perpetual-war-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afghanistan, which saw relatively few</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> I think you got a little of the dynamic that Tanisha is talking about during the Iraq conflict, when <a href="https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/576180/the-national-guards-contribution-300000-plus-iraq-deployments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Guard units were called into service</a>. But as she notes, widespread direct involvement in military action is much lower today relative to the Vietnam War era.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst): Right, Afghanistan wasn’t really on most Americans’ radars. Weekly polls from the Economist/YouGov used to ask people regularly how important they thought the Afghanistan War was: As recently as February 2020, <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/zye3phsf7t/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 29 percent of Americans</a> thought it was “very important,” whereas 69 percent said the economy was very important. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, this doesn’t mean Americans didn’t necessarily care about terrorism — the direct catalyst for the war back in 2001 — more broadly, as 53 percent did say terrorism was “very important” in that same poll. It’s just that the concern didn’t necessarily connect with the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Another thing that stood out to me from the Washington Post’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 investigation into the Afghanistan War</a> was all the ways in which the military and various presidential administrations weren’t honest with the American people about the war, routinely saying things were going far more smoothly in Afghanistan than they actually were.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So there’s the fact that the Afghanistan War wasn’t an important issue for most Americans as you’ve all mentioned, but it’s hard for me to disentangle that from the flawed public perception of how things were going in Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>I also thought this stat from Marquette Law School pollster Charles Franklin was telling: </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can find only 15 survey questions concerning Bush's handling of Afghanistan in the entire 2001-2009 Bush presidency.<br><br>There were 628 questions about his handling of Iraq.</p>— Charles Franklin (@PollsAndVotes) <a href="https://twitter.com/PollsAndVotes/status/1426970149941301249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> To Nathaniel’s point, in researching <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo5514391.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my book on American public opinion and war</a>, I found that after the end of 2002, pollsters basically stopped asking questions about Afghanistan. There was some polling done in 2003 and after, but very few polls were conducted compared to the early stages of the war.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Why was the Iraq War polled more than the Afghanistan War?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> I think in part it was because Afghanistan seemed at first to be a “settled” public issue. The Taliban government fell quickly after the 2001 invasion, and the international community turned to trying to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan soon after. Support for the Afghanistan War also stayed <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23044842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">above 80 percent through all of 2002</a>, while support for <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/19/iraq-war-continues-to-divide-u-s-public-15-years-after-it-began/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Iraq War</a> never reached those levels. The Afghanistan War simply seemed to have more of an “over and done with” perception even though U.S. troops were still in the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The media also moved onto other domestic and foreign policy issues. And even when support for the Afghanistan War fell, it still hovered around 60 percent for several years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, and Iraq was obviously more in the headlines during the later years of the Bush administration as it became clear that there were <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7634313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no weapons of mass destruction</a> and as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/world/middleeast/24iraq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violence among Iraqis increased</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> The “mission accomplished” slogan in Afghanistan speaks to what Sarah said earlier about the Post’s “Afghanistan Papers” investigation. The reasons for Afghanistan War appear to have shifted over time and, in the end, were ultimately quite unclear.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> We’ve touched on this a bit already, but how have Americans’ thoughts on the Afghanistan War changed? Do Americans think the war was broadly worth it?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Gallup has asked <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/352793/americans-split-whether-afghanistan-war-mistake.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans since 2001 whether they thought it was a mistake to send troops to fight in Afghanistan</a>. Initially, most Americans didn’t think the war was a mistake, but the latest poll (taken in July) found the country about evenly split on it.</p>

Rather, most polls show <a href="https://www.pollingreport.com/afghan.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American support for the war has been relatively flat</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> The most recent poll, from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/oacaip2ls4/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist on Aug. 14-17</a> (so after it was clear Kabul would fall to the Taliban), found that 38 percent of Americans thought it was a mistake for us to intervene in Afghanistan in the first place. But only 28 percent thought it was <em>not</em> a mistake — so plenty of Americans aren’t really sure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> It’s also important to remember, though, that most people, most of the time, don’t pay much (if any) attention to issues of foreign policy — even war.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means even though there have been a lot of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kabul-airport-people-fall-from-planes-leaving-afghanistan-videos-photos-2021-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatic images this week</a> of Afghans trying to flee for safety, with many Americans now reconsidering their opinions of the war, that will likely be short-lived. Within a few weeks, I’d guess interest will return to the low levels we’ve seen in the last decade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even now, with interest in Afghanistan high, the share of “not sure” responses is still pretty high, suggesting that this issue will fail to resonate strongly with many Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Bingo. As Nathaniel discussed last year, based on Adam’s work, Americans often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/foreign-policy-doesnt-usually-affect-elections-could-iran-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take their cues on foreign policy from leaders in their party</a> because they aren’t as informed on it and don’t have obvious ideological corners to run to.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> To your point, Adam, when Afghanistan has gotten cable-news attention in the past, it has just as quickly faded from the headlines. Check out these numbers from Robert Griffin, a senior research advisor at Democracy Fund:</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> I do think, though, that Americans’ general relationship to war has changed in that the immediate costs of war are just a lot less visible, as I said at the outset.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In thinking about the broader foreign policy context, the withdrawal from Afghanistan also signals a greater shift in where America is focusing its international strategy: <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R43838.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China</a>. And any military conflict with China would look very different from the Afghanistan War.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> That’s a good point, Tanisha. One thing we wrote about in 2019 was how Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-agree-that-wwii-was-justified-recent-conflicts-are-more-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t think recent military conflicts have been justified</a>, starting with the Vietnam War. So I do think, to your point, <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2019/09/do-americans-really-want-end-forever-wars-survey-says/159760/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American public’s relationship to war is changing</a>. There’s just less support for military conflict, broadly speaking. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as you point out, China is increasingly where America is focusing its attention abroad, and at least right now, both Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/04/democrats-republicans-seem-agree-about-one-foreign-policy-point-getting-tough-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seem to view China negatively</a>. I do think, then, that any potential military conflict would be thought of differently.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turning back to Afghanistan, do we have any sense for how Americans are reacting from the events over the weekend?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Overall, Americans are unhappy with how the withdrawal was handled. According to Morning Consult/Politico, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/16/afghanistan-withdrawal-taliban-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 25 percent of registered voters</a> believed the Afghanistan withdrawal was going “very well” or “somewhat well,” and 57 percent thought it was going “not too well” or “not well at all.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There was also a drop in the share of Americans who support withdrawal — from 69 percent in April to 49 percent this month. But more Americans still support withdrawal than oppose it, 49 percent to 37 percent.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/bidens-approval-rating-fallen-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79388894</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> What has this meant for Biden’s approval rating so far? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Reuters/Ipsos found that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval rating dropped 7 points between Friday and Monday</a>. It seems likely that that was due to the Afghanistan news. But his approval rating was also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping before the weekend</a>, so his current low point definitely isn’t all because of what’s happened in Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> It’s going to be really hard to peel apart what’s happening to Biden’s approval rating because of Afghanistan and what’s happening because of COVID-19. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> Yeah, that’s right, Adam. In the longer term, I would guess that any relationship between Biden’s approval rating and Afghanistan (insofar as you can disentangle from everything else, like COVID-19) is going to depend on whether there are terrorist attacks against American citizens, especially on U.S. soil.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s interesting that the Taliban have been signaling that they will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/world/asia/taliban-leaders-kabul.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more restrained when it comes to international terrorism</a>; they seem to want to be able to engage with the rest of the world. That said, they’re <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11451718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not exactly trustworthy</a>, and I worry Afghans are in for a really horrible time, as the chances for human rights violations under this regime are very high. But the Taliban do have incentives to try and restrain themselves, and are also under <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7ceb9e3b-bd6e-43fe-bb86-80353249e6ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some pressure from Russia and China</a>. So we’ll see.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To Nathaniel’s point on the withdrawal question, it seems that we’ll want to be careful in distinguishing responses on “should we withdraw” from “what do you think of the withdrawal.” Lots of people supported withdrawal but still recognize that this process is going terribly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah. I’m curious, though, if the fact that a plurality of voters still supported withdrawing troops suggests that number will bounce back up after the overwhelming news coverage of Afghanistan fades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, the issue might not fade that quickly if there continue to be new developments and disturbing images coming out of Afghanistan, so perhaps people’s opinions will be more sticky.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The threat of terrorism, as Tanisha mentioned, strikes me as the biggest unknown here. Obviously, Adam’s and others’ research shows that foreign policy isn’t often a super important issue for voters, but I imagine we’ll see an uptick in the share of Americans who are concerned about a terrorist attack. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider that earlier this year, the Pew Research Center’s annual poll on policy priorities found that 63 percent of Americans thought defending the nation against terrorist attacks <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/PP_2021.01.28_policy-priorities_TOPLINE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should still be a high priority</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> According to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/oacaip2ls4/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week’s YouGov/The Economist poll</a>, though, just 19 percent of Americans believe a terrorist attack against the U.S. is “very likely” in the next 12 months; 29 percent think it is “somewhat likely”; 19 percent think it is “not very likely”; and 8 percent think it is “very unlikely.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Adam and Tanisha, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my article about public opinion and Afghanistan</a>, I noted that we might see sharper partisan divides over policy in Afghanistan given it’s in the news and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/16/republicans-criticize-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican leaders in Congress</a> — and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/trump-blasts-biden-not-following-152440623.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside the Capitol</a> — are hammering Biden on it. But previously, there <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/us-public-supports-withdrawal-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hadn’t been as much of a split</a> on the issue of withdrawal. Do you think that will change? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> I think that’s right, Geoffrey. Republican politicians are criticizing Biden for what happened, so I expect that Republican voters would also say that this week’s events are a disaster. And if Democratic politicians jump on board as well in their criticism of Biden, we could see a real drop in his approval. Although, I’d caution that things are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assessing-President-Opinion-Public-Support/dp/0804720967" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more locked in today when it comes to a president’s approval rating</a>, given how polarized our politics are.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if both Democratic and Republican elites criticize Biden, we would essentially move to what political scientist John Zaller calls a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/nature-and-origins-of-mass-opinion/70B1485D3A9CFF55ADCCDD42FC7E926A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-sided information flow</a> — or that when elites from both sides speak the same message, the public largely unifies behind them. Think of it as a sort of reverse “rally around the flag” effect.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> I do wonder how the arrival of Afghan refugees might play into all of this, especially given <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarization around immigration</a> and, frankly, race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Right now at least, support for accepting Afghan refugees is very high. According to YouGov, Americans <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2021/08/17/fcdbe/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support accepting Afghan refugees</a> who worked with Americans into the U.S. 65 percent to 15 percent. And the <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2021/08/18/61982/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numbers are similar</a> if you ask respondents about accepting Afghan refugees who backed the U.S. military to “[their] own state,” although there does seem to be a small “not in my backyard” contingent. But I definitely think there is potential for former President Donald Trump and other nativist politicians to racialize that issue as you hinted at, Tanisha.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>To what extent will the withdrawal from Afghanistan affect Biden’s presidency? Do we have a sense yet of what this means for Biden?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I think the questions for his legacy are interesting, Sarah. But in the short term, my bet is that Afghanistan will quickly fade from the headlines and this won’t affect the 2022 midterms or Biden’s reelection campaign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> Think back to the Iran coverage in early 2020 and its possible effect on the 2020 election — and how that never materialized.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> I agree with Nathaniel and Adam. The one caveat is if there’s a terrorist attack. Otherwise, I think COVID-19/the economy will have a much bigger effect on Biden’s presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Polarization has made <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-approval-rating-has-barely-budged-in-his-first-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential approval ratings extremely steady</a>, as we’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written repeatedly</a>. And I think you can bet on about 10 major news stories breaking between now and November 2022, each of which will be touted as a “<a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/why-campaign-game-changers-rarely-change-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game changer</a>” and then promptly forgotten about.</p>

<p>Opponents of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California have gathered enough signatures to trigger a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gavin-newsom-has-reason-to-worry/">recall election</a> for him on Sept. 14 — only the fourth gubernatorial recall election in U.S. history. If a majority of Californians vote “yes” to recall, Newsom will be removed from office.</p>

<p>If Newsom is removed from office, the second question on the recall ballot will determine his replacement. Forty-six candidates are in the running, and it just takes a simple plurality to win, meaning a candidate could win with only minority support (there is no runoff). Californians can vote on the second question even if they vote against recalling Newsom on the first question.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In early August, President Biden <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2021/08/03/desantis-blames-media-for-hysteria-over-covid-surge-1389404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took aim at Republican governors</a> like Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas for not taking enough precautions to counter the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surge in COVID-19 cases</a> in their states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But DeSantis was quick to pin the blame on Biden instead, <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/new-gop-message-on-surging-covid-its-juans-fault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing the following in a fundraising email</a> to supporters: “Joe Biden has the nerve to tell me to get out of the way on COVID while he lets COVID-infected migrants pour over our southern border by the hundreds of thousands. No elected official is doing more to enable the transmission of COVID in America than Joe Biden with his open borders policies.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Only what DeSantis is claiming isn’t borne out by data. Rather, according to <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/06/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-effort-blame-covid-19-spread-migrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public health experts</a>, the far more likely culprit for the surge in Florida’s cases is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state’s low vaccination rates</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">DeSantis’s decision to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/fabiola-santiago/article253269883.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scapegoat immigrants</a> for the record number of coronavirus cases is important, though, as it speaks to a larger strategy within the GOP: attack Biden’s immigration policies at every conceivable turn. Prominent Republicans, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-border-visit/2021/06/30/8c5165ac-d91c-11eb-8fb8-aea56b785b00_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbGyi9H-v1g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sens. Ted Cruz</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/lindsey-graham-biden-apology-southern-border-migrant-children-b1823688.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsey Graham</a>, not to mention dozens of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/list-republican-senators-border-joe-biden-pressure-1578666" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other GOP lawmakers</a>, have been vocal in their criticism of how the Biden administration has handled immigration. Conservative cable news channel <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> has also doubled down on its immigration coverage since Biden’s inauguration, <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=%28border+OR+immigration+OR+immigrant%29&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20210120000000&amp;edt=20210811235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioning</a> “immigration,” “immigrant” or the “border” more than 39,000 times compared with fewer than 7,000 and 9,000 mentions on CNN and MSNBC, respectively.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran a search of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC coverage from Jan. 20 to Aug. 11 in the TV News Archive using the GDELT Television API. In that database, daily news footage is split into 15-second clips, and searches return the clips that contain a mention of our search query (“immigration” or “immigrant” or “border”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This strategy reflects just how much immigration has become a key issue for Republicans. What’s more, with a Democrat in the White House, Republicans are now more likely to be motivated by immigration, marking a shift in how much issues of race and ethnicity can motivate voters when their party is out of office.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take how strongly Trump supporters currently disapprove of Biden’s performance on immigration. Two <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/v60y11605p/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov polls</a> conducted <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/1aaz80mjhy/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in July</a> found that 84 percent of Trump voters “strongly disapproved” of how the president was handling immigration. That’s the highest level of disapproval of any of the 15 issues The Economist/YouGov asked about in <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/w1um475jkt/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/w2zmwpzsq0/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/1aaz80mjhy/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/v60y11605p/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> in July.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Republicans don’t just disapprove of the job Biden is doing on immigration, though. Data from <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/immigrants_citizenship?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Independent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civiqs’s daily tracking polls</a> shows that Republicans — and to a lesser extent independents — have grown less willing to support a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. Since Election Day 2020, Republicans’ support for deporting unauthorized immigrants has increased by 12 percentage points while independents’ support has ticked up 8 points. It’s because of these increases that overall support for deportations is the highest it's been since Civiqs first asked the question in December 2016.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Civiqs isn’t the only pollster to document this trend either. Polling from the Pew Research Center has also found that the share of Republicans who oppose finding a legal way for unauthorized immigrants to stay in the U.S. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/05/03/most-americans-are-critical-of-governments-handling-of-situation-at-u-s-mexico-border/pp_2021-05-03_immigration_00-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased by 9 points</a> between June 2020 and April 2021. And <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-republicans/republicans-hostility-grows-toward-illegal-immigrants-as-party-attacks-biden-on-border-idUSKBN2B919J" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos</a> pointed to an even sharper uptick — an 18-point increase in the share of Republicans who opposed a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants — from 2018 to February 2021. Overall, Republicans are just a lot more likely to say <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/05/PP_2021.05.03_immigration_00-05.png?w=620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal immigration poses a very serious problem</a>, up from 43 percent in 2020 to 72 percent in April.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, this trend fits within a familiar pattern in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111666?origin=crossref&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political science research</a> arguing that public opinion often <a href="https://themonkeycage.org/2010/06/the_public_is_a_thermostat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operates as a thermostat</a>, whereby the public shifts against the current president’s positions to prevent policy-making from becoming too liberal or too conservative. On immigration, for instance, Americans’ opinions moved sharply to the left in response to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/5/17527734/trump-immigration-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s restrictive rhetoric and policies</a> — this was the case especially <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-democrats-win-on-immigration-policy-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among Democrats</a>. Just as with a thermostat, though, public opinion is now reacting to the warmer environment on immigration under Biden by growing cooler toward it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These recent pendulum swings on immigration, however, mark a potentially noteworthy departure. Thermostatic trends in Americans’ views about race and ethnicity have <a href="https://pages.uncc.edu/mary-atkinson/wp-content/uploads/sites/619/2014/02/BeyondThermostat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically been weaker</a> than Americans’ reactions to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/7/18656441/policy-mood-liberal-stimson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidents’ economic policies</a>. But that was <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691176192/white-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before immigration became such a deep dividing line</a> between Democrats and Republicans. Now, with the two parties <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-became-stuck-on-immigration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushing harder in opposite directions</a> on immigration than they have in the recent past, immigration has emerged as an important political issue with significant policy consequences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the Trump administration was frequently criticized for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-politics-immigration-united-states-a5bfcbea280a468b431a02e82c15a150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its strict immigration policies</a>, like separating children from their migrant parents, banning travel from predominantly Muslim countries and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/891563635/trump-administration-rejects-1st-time-daca-applications-violates-scotus-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limiting protections</a> for unauthorized immigrants brought to the country as children, which pushed Democrats further to the left on immigration. Likewise, the criticism that the Biden administration is not doing enough to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/briefing/sedition-miami-beach-curfew-astrazeneca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure the U.S.-Mexico border</a> with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/12/politics/us-mexico-border-migrants/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of migrants crossing the border</a> at a two-decade high is pushing Republicans further to the right on immigration. That growing hostility is likely to be a motivating factor in Republican politics throughout Biden’s presidency. From the earliest days of Trump’s presidential campaign, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-immigrant sentiments fueled</a> his rise to the top of the Republican Party. They also <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/653374/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped move</a> some of then-President Barack Obama’s 2012 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/83/1/91/5494625?login=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporters to vote for Trump</a> in the 2016 general election. Republicans’ rising concerns about Trump’s signature policy issue of immigration should, therefore, only solidify his stranglehold on the GOP in the Biden era. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden’s decision in April to withdraw American combat troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11 <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/afghanistan-updates-chaos-kabul-airport-worlds-response/story?id=79474962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set in motion a collapse of the Afghan government</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/14/world/asia/afghanistan-maps-taliban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accelerated in recent weeks</a>. The Taliban have now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taliban-takeover-afghanistan-what-to-know-1a74c9cd866866f196c478aba21b60b6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seized back control</a> of the country as Americans evacuate and Afghans are left to face the grim aftermath.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not the ending to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/us/politics/biden-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-year “forever” war</a> Biden promised. But it’s hard to say just how harshly Americans will judge Biden for what’s happened. That’s because Americans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/26/will-foreign-policy-be-a-major-issue-in-the-2016-election-heres-what-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to not care a great deal about foreign policy</a>, and, moreover, most Americans previously supported Biden’s decision to pull troops out of Afghanistan. That said, even if most Americans want out of Afghanistan, it’s possible that they don’t like how it’s unfolded and Biden’s overall approval does take a hit as a result — it’s already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the lowest point of his presidency</a>. But it’s not clear that that will happen. There is simply a lot that is still unknown, and given that this is a fast-changing story, it’s hard to know what the lasting repercussions for domestic politics will be<strong> </strong>at this point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least until the events of this weekend, though, Americans supported Biden’s decision to remove U.S. military forces from Afghanistan. Most polls conducted since the beginning of July show that a sizable majority of Americans supported Biden’s decision, as the table below shows. But as the latest poll from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/16/afghanistan-withdrawal-taliban-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult</a> conducted over the weekend suggests, that could be changing.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the first poll conducted over the past weekend — after the imminence of the Taliban’s takeover became apparent — <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/16/afghanistan-withdrawal-taliban-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult</a> found a decline in support for withdrawing troops and an increase in opposition to the withdrawal. In the survey, 49 percent of registered voters supported the decision to remove troops, while 37 percent opposed it, a shift from the pollster’s <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/07/14051637/2107045_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous survey in early July</a>. Additionally, 51 percent said they disapproved of Biden’s handling of the situation in Afghanistan and <a href="https://twitter.com/MorningConsult/status/1427363282135011328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 25 percent</a> felt the withdrawal was going well. While we’ll have to see what polls show in the coming days, this survey suggests at least some backlash to the Biden administration’s approach.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it’s possible Americans won’t penalize Biden all that much for what’s happened in Afghanistan because, outside of <a href="https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/upload/electoralcostofwar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some major conflicts</a>, foreign policy doesn’t usually weigh heavily on voters’ minds. Foreign policy is a critical matter — events in recent days have reminded us of the serious implications of the U.S.’s decisions — but the reality is that for years Americans have paid <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/afghanistan-war-memory/396701/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very little attention</a> to the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Additionally, Americans’ perspectives on the Afghanistan conflict are mixed, with <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/352793/americans-split-whether-afghanistan-war-mistake.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup recently finding</a> about an even split on the question of whether it was a mistake for the U.S. to send troops in the first place. After 20 years in Afghanistan and the unpopular war in Iraq, Americans are <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2019/09/do-americans-really-want-end-forever-wars-survey-says/159760/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skeptical of intervening militarily</a> in foreign countries — <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/564824-poll-75-percent-say-us-should-not-get-involved-after-haitian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even for humanitarian reasons</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One thing that does seem likely, however, is that opinions of Biden’s handling of Afghanistan will become more polarized by party. We’re already seeing this with the new Politico/Morning consult survey: Net support for the withdrawal among Democrats was +53 (69 percent supported it, 19 percent opposed) while GOP net support was -27 (31 percent supported it, 58 percent opposed). And it’s possible Republican attitudes on Afghanistan may shift farther away from Democratic ones. Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/foreign-policy-doesnt-usually-affect-elections-could-iran-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to follow cues</a> from elites in their parties on foreign policy issues, and at this point, Republicans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/16/republicans-criticize-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are going on the attack</a>. Both the hawkish wing of the party and the more Trumpian isolationist faction <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/16/1028081817/congressional-reaction-to-bidens-afghanistan-withdrawal-has-been-scathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are criticizing Biden</a> for what’s happened, even though many Republicans, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/04/973604904/trumps-deal-to-end-war-in-afghanistan-leaves-biden-with-a-terrible-situation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including former President Donald Trump</a>, wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan. So it’s possible <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-really-really-dislike-biden-but-its-not-just-about-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what little standing Biden enjoyed among Republicans</a> overall could further erode. Democrats, on the other hand, are unlikely to break with Biden even if more of them now disapprove of the withdrawal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the whole, we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-should-still-pay-attention-to-joe-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t expect</a> to see a big shift in Biden’s approval rating, given just how polarized American politics are. But it’s also impossible to currently ascertain the longer-term consequences of the Taliban’s takeover, such as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/15/afghanistan-taliban-terrorist-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential increase in terrorism</a>. It’s possible that what’s happened in Afghanistan will dominate headlines for weeks to come, but even that’s uncertain. After all, <a href="https://twitter.com/rp_griffin/status/1427322936038416385?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American news coverage of Afghanistan has surged before</a>, only to quickly evaporate. And even if the spotlight stays on the crisis in Afghanistan, that doesn’t necessarily mean Biden will lose ground in approval. Consider a common comparison the media has made in recent days: the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/08/15/saigon-fall-kabul-taliban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall of Saigon</a> (now Ho Chi Minh City) in April 1975 in South Vietnam to North Vietnamese forces, a similarly chaotic moment of defeat for the U.S. at the end of the Vietnam War. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/23995/gerald-ford-retrospective.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a Gallup poll</a> taken before North Vietnamese troops took control of the city, then-President Gerald Ford’s approval rating was 39 percent, and it was 40 percent in a survey taken right afterward. And <a href="https://twitter.com/DKarol/status/1427272244275908618?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this was at a time</a> with a substantially less polarized electorate and many more swing voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/bin-laden-2001-end-war-afghanistan/619767/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">But fairly or not</a>, the reality is that Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/15/us/politics/afghanistan-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will now likely be associated</a> with the ugly end of America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, which ultimately failed to build a stable democratic regime. At this point, though, it remains to be seen just how that will influence overall public opinion toward Biden and his presidency.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, President Biden’s agenda took a big step forward with <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-11-trillion-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-big/story?id=79378221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the U.S. Senate’s overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to pass</a> his $1.1 trillion infrastructure package. This first step toward a deal — the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/11/house-democrats-moderates-infrastructure-spending-503917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still must pass it</a> — couldn’t come at a better time for Biden, either, as the delta variant of the coronavirus has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led to a surge</a> in cases, throwing much of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/consumer-spending-gross-domestic-product-economy-business-ea9f24b146848b0821b549abb6cf78c8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic recovery</a> of the past few months into jeopardy. There is also the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/taliban-seek-project-calm-us-speeds-chaotic-evacuation-79474090?cid=clicksource_4380645_1_heads_hero_live_hero_hed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collapse of Afghanistan’s government</a> Biden must now contend with as he oversees the withdrawal of America’s military presences in the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s too soon to know how Biden’s handling of Afghanistan will affect his approval rating, but approval of his handling of the pandemic, which has hovered around the low 60s for much of his presidency, has already taken a hit. Now only<em> </em>55 percent<em> </em>of Americans approve of the job he is doing, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s coronavirus presidential approval tracker</a>. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="593" height="586" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-15-at-7.34.26-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-15-at-7.34.26-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-15-at-7.34.26-PM.png?w=593 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-15-at-7.34.26-PM.png?w=1186 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This downturn in how Americans think Biden is handling the pandemic also seems to be at least somewhat connected to the recent decline in his overall approval rating, which has fallen to about 50 percent in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>, the lowest point so far in his eight months in office. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What to make of Biden’s job approval ticking downward?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/bidens-approval-rating-fallen-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79388894</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Well, the first thing to keep in mind is that the recent slide in Biden’s approval is still relatively small, as his average approval rating has fallen from about 52 percent over the course of July to 50 percent now. And that’s not that unusual given our current <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperpolarized political environment</a>; opinions of the president <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-should-still-pay-attention-to-joe-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are now largely baked in</a> so that a president’s ratings tend to hover <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within a narrow range of outcomes</a>. We don’t know the range in which Biden’s approval will ultimately settle, but if the past two presidents are any indication, it’ll be a narrow one: Donald Trump’s approval mostly hovered between 40 and 45 percent during his presidency, while Barack Obama’s approval tended to fall between 45 and 50 percent. In that sense, Biden’s current approval rating is perfectly normal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible this current decline could be temporary, given the role the delta variant <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/04/joe-biden-coronavirus-approval-rating-502439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has played in driving</a> Biden’s overall numbers down. Approval of Biden’s handling of the coronavirus has seen the largest decline in the past few weeks, although his numbers on some other issues have also slipped slightly, too. To be clear, he still polls better on COVID-19 than on other issues, like crime and immigration. But among Republicans and independents, where this has been one of his strongest issues, his approval has taken a particularly large hit in recent weeks. Since mid-July, his coronavirus approval numbers among independents have declined from the high 50s to the low 50s, and among Republicans, his numbers have sagged from the low 30s to the low 20s. (Democrats’ attitudes on Biden’s handling of the coronavirus have ticked down a hair, from the low 90s to high 80s.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there are also some reasons to think that this slip in Biden’s overall approval rating might not be a blip.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The biggest reason is that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/04/biden-approval-independents-covid-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independents may be souring on Biden</a> — and it’s not clear that it’s just his handling of the coronavirus driving it. Biden’s ratings among independents have fallen in recent weeks — a sample of polls conducted since early July by Morning Consult, The Economist/YouGov and Ipsos suggests Biden’s approval with this group has fallen by an average of 2 to 4 percentage points in recent weeks. But Biden had already been slowly losing ground among independents. For instance, Biden’s approval among independent voters in Morning Consult’s polling has trended downward since he took office, from around the low 50s to the low 40s. That’s a very slow descent over the past eight months, but it’s also a trend that predates the surge in American cases of the delta variant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-only-on-ap-4dafe5b7a4adf2502280bb23b775af07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns about the economy</a> have played a role in Biden’s decline. Recent surveys suggest Americans are particularly worried about inflation, for instance, which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/11/july-prices-cpi-inflation-fed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shot up in recent months</a>. In fact, about one-third of registered voters named inflation as their top economic concern in an early August <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/566297-poll-inflation-named-as-top-economic-concern-among-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey by The Hill/HarrisX</a>, and 86 percent of Americans told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/bidens-approval-rating-on-handling-of-covid-and-economy-fall-in-latest-cnbc-all-america-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC/Hart Research/Public Opinion Strategies</a> in late July that they’d taken at least one action to combat the rise in prices, such as reducing their spending on discretionary items or saving less money. Biden’s approval on his handling of the economy has ticked down slightly in recent surveys, too, including a <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/08/Fox_August-7-10-2021_National_Topline_August-11-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News poll last week</a> that found approval of his handling of the economy at 47 percent, down from <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/06/Fox_June-19-22-2021_National_Topline_June-23-Release-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51 percent in June</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, it’s true that these economic concerns are at least partly tied to the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, but there are also some indications that Americans might be growing leery of large government expenditures. A late July <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/28/inflation-biden-economic-policies-pre-pandemic-behaviors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult survey</a> found, for instance, that slightly more registered voters (59 percent) thought the Biden’s administration’s policies were very or somewhat responsible for the 13-year high in inflation than America’s return to pre-pandemic behaviors (53 percent). While Republicans were the biggest driver of this difference — 82 percent blamed the administration compared to 39 percent who blamed the reopening process — independents were also more likely to say the Biden team’s policies were responsible, 58 percent to 47 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not to say that Biden’s policies are unpopular, however. The coronavirus stimulus package <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-signs-19-trillion-covid-relief-bill-hours/story?id=76392367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed in March</a> had <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-bidens-covid-19-relief-bill-help-democrats-avoid-a-midterm-defeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the support</a> of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-betting-on-public-support-to-push-his-agenda-polls-show-his-big-spending-packages-have-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly two-thirds</a> of Americans. And that recent Fox News survey found 62 percent of registered voters also backed the bipartisan infrastructure deal, with 56 percent even saying they supported the Democrats’ <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rocky-road-ahead-infrastructure-bill-35-trillion-budget/story?id=79404937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still-in-progress $3.5 trillion spending plan</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Democrats’ spending plans do risk sparking a backlash, as FiveThirtyEight contributor Daniel Cox <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-push-for-big-government-solutions-is-popular-now-but-it-could-backfire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued in May</a>. Cox noted that last September a record-high share of Americans — 54 percent — <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/321041/new-high-government-solve-problems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Gallup</a> the government should do more to solve the country’s problems, compared with 41 percent of Americans who felt the government was doing too much. But now more recent polling suggests support for government intervention has already slipped. Only 44 percent told Fox News that they preferred the federal government “lend them a hand,” compared to 57 percent who said the same in August 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that the situation in Afghanistan could take a further toll on Biden’s approval ratings — it’s just too soon to say at this point. But if Biden’s approval decline is mainly tied to reactions to the delta variant surge, which <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;facet=none&amp;pickerSort=desc&amp;pickerMetric=new_cases_smoothed_per_million&amp;hideControls=true&amp;Metric=Confirmed+cases&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=IND~USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~FRA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could abate before too long</a>, that could point to a possible silver lining for Biden. Then again, there could be more substantial, long-lasting cracks in his support, perhaps tied to his administration’s big spending ways.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The COVID-19 pandemic is now, more than ever, a story about the unvaccinated. They’re the most vulnerable — in states reporting breakthrough infections, over 90 percent of cases, hospitalizations and deaths have occurred among people who are unvaccinated or not yet fully vaccinated, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-data-from-the-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a> (KFF). And this significant pool of Americans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/17/unvaccinated-coronavirus-covid-variants-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may open the door</a> for even more dangerous mutations than the delta variant — nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as contagious</a> than previous strains — that could challenge the effectiveness of existing vaccines.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So who, exactly, are we talking about? Three in 10 American adults remain unvaccinated, according to the <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-july-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest survey</a> from the KFF. But they’re not a monolith — their reasons, backgrounds, politics and willingness to eventually get vaccinated all vary. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, among vaccine holdouts, the biggest group are those who say they definitely don’t want the vaccine — about 14 percent of the overall population — and there’s no evidence they’re changing their minds. That number has remained pretty constant for months. (The most recent poll we have was conducted in July, so we’ll have to wait to see if the increased risk posed by the delta variant changes anything.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Ten percent of vaccine-eligible Americans want to “wait and see” how the vaccine is working for others before deciding whether to get the jab. This group has shrunk significantly over time, suggesting they can be swayed. They’re more diverse than the hard noes; 4 in 10 adults in the wait-and-see group are people of color, compared with 26 percent in the “definitely not” group. There are also larger proportions of Democrats, younger adults and people reporting lower levels of education and income among the wait-and-see-ers. They have concerns about the vaccine, but some of them are also facing access barriers, said Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/covid-19-cases-rising-americans-thoughts-steps-fivethirtyeight-79188933</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">“They may not have paid time off of work in getting the vaccine and recovering from side effects, they may not have a trusted health care provider that they can go to to ask them questions about the vaccine, and they’re also more likely than the ‘definitely not’ group to say that they’re worried about getting infected,” Hamel said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most adults who have yet to get the vaccine, whether because of worries about safety or access barriers, say it’s unlikely they’ll get the jab this year — and nearly half say they “definitely” won’t. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="532" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Compared to the “wait-and-see” group, those in the “definitely not” group have larger proportions of non-Hispanic white adults, Republicans, adults living in rural areas and white evangelical Christians.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 14 percent of Americans who are firmly opposed to getting the vaccine are overwhelmingly non-Hispanic white adults, they are much more likely to be insured, and they are more likely to identify as Republican.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1122" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-3-DESKTOP.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-3-DESKTOP.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-3-DESKTOP.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-3-DESKTOP.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="2862" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-3-MOBILE.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-3-MOBILE.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-3-MOBILE.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-3-MOBILE.png?w=1240 2x"></figure></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can see partisanship geographically too: The vaccination <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-is-growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gap has been growing</a> between counties that voted for former President Donald Trump and those that voted for President Biden. In two months, the gap went from 6.5 percent to 11.7 percent.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-4-DESKTOP.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-4-DESKTOP.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-4-DESKTOP.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-4-DESKTOP.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="1694" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-4-MOBILE.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-4-MOBILE.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-4-MOBILE.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-4-MOBILE.png?w=1240 2x"></figure></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those firmly opposed to the jab are also much more likely to believe misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. A Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-april-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> from April found that 81 percent of the “definitely not” group was more likely to believe or was unsure about at least one vaccine myth, including the false ideas that vaccines contain fetal cells, cause infertility or change our DNA. This may explain why they still overwhelmingly think the vaccine is a bigger risk to their health than COVID-19.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="886" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-5-DESKTOP.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-5-DESKTOP.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-5-DESKTOP.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-5-DESKTOP.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="1668" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-5-MOBILE.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-5-MOBILE.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-5-MOBILE.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mejia.VACCINE-POLLS.0813-5-MOBILE.png?w=1240 2x"></figure></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">So as the ‘wait and see’ group has shrunk over the last few months, and the share of vaccinated Americans has climbed to about 70 percent, the bloc of still unvaccinated Americans has become more heavily made up of those who remain staunchly unpersuaded to get a vaccine. And that could become a problem for everyone. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/science/johnson-delta-vaccine-booster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vaccines</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-delta-variant-and-covid-19-vaccines-what-to-know-11627079604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have proven</a> to be effective against the delta variant, but unvaccinated Americans can open the door for more dangerous mutations. If that time comes, vaccinated Americans may be in trouble too, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said in an <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article253248688.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with McClatchy last week.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“People who are not getting vaccinated mistakenly think it’s only about them. But it isn’t. It’s about everybody else, also,” Fauci said.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Something rare just happened in Congress. During an era defined by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme partisan animosity</a>, Republican and Democratic senators came together on Tuesday<strong> </strong>to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-11-trillion-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-big/story?id=79378221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass a $1.1 trillion infrastructure package</a> that invests billions of dollars in roads, bridges and infrastructure projects; provides federal funding to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/inside-senates-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-79387452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modernize public transportation</a> and the electrical grid, allowing for more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/climate-electricity-infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewable energy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first blush, this looks like a huge win for President Biden, who campaigned on <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/22/biden-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-500526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the importance of bipartisanship</a>. And as my colleague Geoffrey Skelley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-americans-really-care-about-bipartisanship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously reported</a>, Americans like it (or at least they say they like it) when Republicans and Democrats work together. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this bill is not without political risk for Biden and Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For starters, it faces a long path to becoming law. That’s because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/senate-passes-infrastructure-bill-and-budget-resolution.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has held firm</a> in her decision to not bring up the infrastructure bill in the House until the Senate passes a second, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/senate-passes-3point5-trillion-budget-resolution-after-infrastructure-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more ambitious spending package</a> through the budget reconciliation process. Progressive House members have also threatened to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/10/the-senate-passes-infrastructure-bill-whats-next.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withhold support for the bipartisan infrastructure bill</a> unless the Senate acts on this bigger package that includes funding for climate change and health care, among other priorities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This could set up a big political fight for Democrats this fall. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the chamber’s most vocal moderate Democrats, says <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-825739838a790668b2d2855a72821d56" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he has not decided</a> if he’ll support the legislation with its current price tag of $3.5 trillion, issuing a statement in which he warned of the bill’s “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-debate-35-trillion-spending-plan-enters-second-day-2021-08-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grave consequences</a>” for the nation’s debt. Sen. Krysten Sinema of Arizona, another vocal moderate, said in late July that <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/07/28/arizona-sen-kyrsten-sinema-wont-back-democrats-3-5-trillion-reconciliation-bill/5402193001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she will not support</a> a bill of that price. Plus, touting ambitious bill packages hasn’t worked well for Democrats in the past. Back in 2010, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/WN/HealthCare/obama-signs-health-care-bill-law/story?id=10178597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Affordable Care Act</a> faced a similarly divided Democratic Party, and in fact, subsequent research suggests that the law hurt Democrats in that year’s midterms. <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/nyhan/files/2021/03/health-care-vote-effects.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One 2012 study found</a> that Democrats who voted in favor of the ACA saw their vote share <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X11433768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop by 8.5 percentage points</a>, on average. Moreover, Republicans didn’t just do well that midterm cycle — they won their largest share of seats in the House <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Party-Divisions/74-Present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the 1940s</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that voters will be turned off if the fight over passing the infrastructure and reconciliation bills drags on too long and is perceived as too complicated. Research has found that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voters-like-a-political-party-until-it-passes-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters often punish</a> — rather than reward — parties that move to achieve their policy goals. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s working in Democrats’ favor right now, though, is that the infrastructure bill is popular. An <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/08/04/americans-support-infrastructure-bill-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov</a> poll from last week found that 51 percent of U.S. adults supported the infrastructure measure, while just 19 percent opposed it. A Quinnipiac survey <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released the same day</a> put support for the bill even higher, with 65 percent of Americans approving of the package. That said, both polls suggest that more Democrats than Republicans are in favor: 61 percent of Democrats versus 47 percent of Republicans in the Economist/YouGov poll, and a whopping 93 percent of Democrats versus 41 percent of Republicans in the Quinnipiac poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason something like infrastructure appeals to Americans is because many think that improving infrastructure should be a priority in Washington. According to an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-government-and-politics-only-on-ap-a5454467619247e89b9c87697ac0d6f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP-NORC survey in July</a>, both Republicans and Democrats were overwhelmingly in favor of various proposals for the infrastructure bill, including funding for roads, bridges and ports as well as funding for pipes that supply public drinking water.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And this fits in <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/bidens-plan-for-getting-big-things-done.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s governing strategy</a> of trying to pass measures that are popular with the overall electorate in the hope that voters will later reward him and Democrats. But it’s not clear whether that strategy will pay off. It’s certainly better than Biden trying to push through unpopular bills, but as the Washington Post’s Perry Bacon Jr. wrote for FiveThirtyEight earlier this year, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-dont-fear-an-electoral-backlash-for-opposing-really-popular-parts-of-bidens-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popularity around the COVID-19 stimulus package</a> that Democrats passed in Biden’s first 100 days may not result in electoral benefits. For instance, polling from the Pew Research Center found that support for the bill was especially high among <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-bidens-covid-19-relief-bill-help-democrats-avoid-a-midterm-defeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower-income Republicans</a>, but at least as it pertains to Biden’s approval rating, Republican voters not only largely disapprove of Biden, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-really-really-dislike-biden-but-its-not-just-about-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they <em>strongly</em> disapprove of him</a> as well. At the end of the day, it could be that most Americans are not going to break from their political views regardless of what the other side passes in terms of policy.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also likely Republicans will <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-climate-164e59e31e42a646bc520042ac5e13af" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try and use the high cost</a> of the infrastructure and reconciliation bills as leverage against Democrats next year. A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/most-gop-senators-sign-pledge-to-not-help-democrats-on-debt-ceiling-11628638081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of Republicans</a>, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have already vowed that Democrats “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-9fa48bfe5daeb95179cf539b59c4b7e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t get our help</a>” to raise the debt limit. Moreover, the bipartisan infrastructure bill now in front of the House is expensive. According to an estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/us/politics/infrastructure-cost-senate-cbo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add $256 billion to the federal debt</a> over the next decade, and as we hinted at, debate over the debt limit this fall is already expected to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/09/democrats-debt-limit-mcconnell-502885" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further divide the two parties</a>. Plus, polls suggest that even now voters are concerned about inflation and the federal government’s ability to handle it. According to a <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/566297-poll-inflation-named-as-top-economic-concern-among-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hill-HarrisX poll</a> in August, 31 percent of registered voters named inflation as their top concern when thinking about the future of the economy. Among Republicans, that number jumped to 37 percent, but 23 percent of Democrats also put inflation as their top concern. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Congress in recess until mid-September, it’ll be awhile before we have a clear sense for where this political fight is headed, and which party has the upperhand, but for now, it’s possible that we’ve seen the limit to what popular bills can do.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-impact-warning-report-united-nations-intergovernmental-panel-ipcc-code-red-humanity/">major climate report</a> released Monday by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that global temperatures are likely to lead to even worse heat waves and other types of extreme weather. Despite that alarming finding, though, U.S. adults don’t seem to be taking climate change more seriously, according to new polling from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/09/climate-change-natural-disasters-ipcc-report-data/">Morning Consult</a>. In fact, since May, concern over climate change and its impact has remained steady: The share of U.S. adults who say they’re “very concerned” has hovered between 38 percent and 42 percent, while roughly one-third of adults say they’re “somewhat concerned.”</li><li>On Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/andrew-cuomo-had-nowhere-to-go-but-out/">announced plans to resign</a> after the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, released a report last week detailing <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.08.03_nyag_-_investigative_report.pdf">allegations of sexual harassment by 11 different women</a>. Now Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul will become governor, making her the state’s first female governor. But polls show she’s unknown to most New Yorkers. When Marist <a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/new-york-state-marist-poll-results-analysis-august-11-2021/">asked residents about Hochul’s favorability</a>, 64 percent of New Yorkers said either they’ve never heard of her or they don’t know how to rank her.. That said, just 13 percent had an unfavorable view of her and 23 percent had a favorable view, so there is a lot of upside here for Hochul to make a positive impression as she has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/wireStory/hochul-run-governor-finishing-cuomos-term-79420623">now said she plans to run for governor in 2022</a>. </li><li>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed how Americans get groceries. According to new Gallup polling, the percentage of U.S. adults who now <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/353090/grocery-shopping-online-fewer-dining.aspx">say that they order groceries online at least monthly</a> has more than doubled, going from 11 percent in 2019, to 23 percent now. And at this point, this phenomenon is mostly concentrated among married people with young children (37 percent) and those with an annual household income over $100,000 (29 percent). However, a majority of American adults (64 percent) say they never order groceries for pickup or delivery. </li><li>There’s been a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/">big discussion as of late</a> into whether schools should be allowed to teach critical race theory and have frank discussions about racism in the U.S. And new polling from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/08/12/deep-divisions-in-americans-views-of-nations-racial-history--and-how-to-address-it/">Pew Research Center</a> shows that most Americans believe increased attention to  the history of racism is a good thing for society. Per the poll, 53 percent of U.S. adults think it’s “very” or “somewhat” good for society to be aware of the history of slavery and racism in America, while 26 percent of respondents think it’s bad for society. The survey found wide partisan and racial divides, too. Black (75 percent), Asian American (64 percent) and Hispanic adults (59 percent) were more likely to view heightened attention to this topic as a good thing, while just a little under half of white adults (46 percent) felt the same way. The partisan divide was even more stark, Pew found. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, only 25 percent said greater attention to racism and slavery was good for society, compared to 78 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. </li><li>Democrats and Democratic leaners voters are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to support making college tuition free, according to new polling from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/11/democrats-overwhelmingly-favor-free-college-tuition-while-republicans-are-divided-by-age-education/">Pew Research Center</a>. Per their survey, 85 percent of Democrats said they favor making college tuition free, compared to just 36 percent of Republicans. Those most strongly supportive of tuition-free college were adults who fall between the ages of 18-29 (73 percent), who have only a high school diploma (69 percent) and who were women (68 percent). There was a racial divide, too: overwhelming majorities of Black (86 percent), Hispanic (82 percent) and Asian American (69 percent) adults supported free college tuition, but only 53 percent of white adults did.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval </strong></h2>

<p>What If The House Of Representatives Had More Than 435 Seats?See how adding more seats makes Congress more representative</p>
<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/ryan-best/">Ryan Best</a></p>
<p>The number of voting members in the U.S. House of Representatives has been stuck at 435 for more than 100 years1 even though the country’s population has more than tripled in that time. This has created the perfect recipe for unequal representation: Every decade, these 435 seats in the House <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/congressional-apportionment/about.html">must be reapportioned</a> to adjust for population changes, even though more seats aren’t added. This means representatives in some states like Delaware end up representing way more people than in other states like Montana.</p>
<p><em>Here’s how apportionment works and which states are over- and underrepresented as a result</em></p>
<p>We’ve now apportioned all 435 seats in the House! Notice how smaller states are much more likely to be further from the national average.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>A scatterplot of states by state population and average district size versus the national average, where dots are sized by state population. With 435 seats in the House, the average state’s population per congressional seat is 50.2k people away from the national average.</p>
<p>With all 435 House seats apportioned, we see significant discrepancies in district sizes across states. Montana and Rhode Island, for instance, will each have about 215,000 fewer people per district than the national average. Delaware, by contrast, will be the most underrepresented state in the union: Its 990,837 residents will have just one representative. But it’s not just the smaller — that is, less populous — states that get a raw deal. Bigger states also suffer from underrepresentation compared with some smaller states. Take California: Its population is 68.5 times as large as Wyoming’s, but based on the 2020 census, California was apportioned only 52 seats compared with Wyoming’s one. This means the average California House member will represent more than 761,000 constituents, while Wyoming’s will represent just shy of 578,000.</p>
<p>To be sure, perfectly equal representation in the House isn’t actually attainable — the fact that each state is guaranteed at least one seat and that districts can’t cross state lines limits what’s possible. But we could get <i>much</i> closer to equal representation if we expanded the size of the House beyond our current (and rather arbitrary) cap of 435.</p>
<p>One method we could use to add more seats to the House is the <em>small state rule</em>, where we’d divide the total U.S. population by that of the smallest state (Wyoming). Another is the <em>cube root law</em>, or the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20446639">trend observed in political science</a> that the number of seats in many countries’ lower chambers is quite close to the <a href="https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/algebra/cuberoots.php">cube root</a> of that nation’s population. And in some countries that have even more representatives <a href="https://fruitsandvotes.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/economix-expand-the-us-house/">like the U.K., France and Germany</a>, political scientists have found that number is closer to the cube root of twice the country’s population (<em>2x cube root law</em>).</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>As you’ve probably discovered, the more seats we add to the House, the more equal representation generally gets across all 50 states. That said, there are some pretty big limitations to how many seats we could realistically add to the chamber. (Can you imagine the electoral and logistical chaos that would ensue from doubling the size of the House in one fell swoop?) Bottom line: Each seat we do add to our current cap of 435 does get us just that much closer to the one-person, one-vote ethos that the House was ultimately created to fulfill.</p>]]></description>

Every 10 years, the Census Bureau counts how many people each state has and then uses that number to calculate how many representatives each state gets out of the 435 seats.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, the House has &lt;a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Apportionment/Determining-Apportionment/#:~:text=The%20total%20membership%20of%20the,Representatives%20from%20the%2050%20states." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;441 members&lt;/a&gt;: 435 are voting members from each of the 50 states, and six are nonvoting members. The District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa each have a delegate, while Puerto Rico has a resident commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a> In April, for instance, we learned from the reapportionment process that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California would lose a seat for the very first time</a> while Texas would gain two.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite some states losing seats while others pick them up, the reapportionment process is itself now fairly mundane. That wasn’t always the case, though.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“The <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/washington-casts-first-presidential-veto-april-5-1792-221503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first presidential veto</a> was used on the apportionment law, so it’s been a hot issue from the very, very beginning,” said <a href="https://uwm.edu/history/people/anderson-margo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Margo Anderson</a>, a professor emerita at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who studies <a href="http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300195422/american-census" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the social and political history of the census</a>. In fact, until the House was capped at 435 seats<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This number increased to 437 in 1959 to accommodate the statehood of Alaska and Hawaii but returned to 435 in 1963, after the reapportionment process in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> by the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1901-1950/The-Permanent-Apportionment-Act-of-1929/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1929 Permanent Apportionment Act</a>, each apportionment period was regularly accompanied by clashes over how to best divvy up political power in Congress — including the size of the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, it’s probably a good thing that Congress is no longer debating the size of the House every 10 years. After all, the reason we have the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act in the first place is that Congress <a href="https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/House-Arrest-Dan-Bouk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was unable to reach an agreement</a> on how to reapportion the House for nearly a decade.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, the fact that the size of the House hasn’t increased in more than a century is a real problem for our democracy. For starters, there is an ever wider gulf between Americans and their representatives, as the average number of people represented in a district has more than tripled, from about 210,000 in 1910 to about 760,000 in 2020.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout this piece, we’ll often refer to census years as the time when the House was reapportioned for simplicity’s sake. But historically, Congress has &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/reference/apportionment/apportionment_legislation_1790_-_1830.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;usually passed apportionment acts&lt;/a&gt; in the year or two &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the census was released, but still in time for elections ahead of the next Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>15</sup></a> Moreover, some states are severely <a href="https://apportionment.us/Ladewig&amp;Jasinski.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over- and underrepresented</a> as a result.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Increasing the size of the House would not resolve all the challenges facing the U.S., as any expansion would involve trade-offs. For instance, adding representatives could decrease day-to-day legislative efficiency, and it would undoubtedly increase the size of the federal government. Yet expanding the House is one of the more straightforward reforms that leaders in Washington could pursue in our era of polarized politics. The size of the House is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2006-title2/USCODE-2006-title2-chap1-sec2a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determined by statute</a>, not the Constitution, meaning Congress could pass (and the president could sign) a law to change it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s worth exploring, then, whether 435 is still an appropriate number of House members to represent our sprawling, diverse nation. Whether Congress will take up this issue anytime soon is another question entirely, but here’s how we got stuck at 435 in the first place — and what it would mean if we increased that number.</p>



<hr><h2><strong>Why 435?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There have been 435 seats in the House for so long now that it might seem as if the Founding Fathers had foreseen it as a natural ceiling for the chamber’s size. But that isn’t the case: 435 is entirely arbitrary. The House arrived at that number because of political expediency — and it has stayed there because of it, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Up until 1910, when the chamber <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1910_Apportionment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded from 391 to 435 seats,</a><a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon statehood, Congress added two seats for New Mexico and one for Arizona in 1912 during the &lt;a href="https://history.house.gov/Congressional-Overview/Profiles/62nd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;62nd Congress&lt;/a&gt;, which had already passed the &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1910_Apportionment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Apportionment Act of 1911&lt;/a&gt;. This brought the total number of House seats to 394 before the House expanded to 435 seats in the 63rd Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> the size of the House had experienced a mostly unchecked pattern of growth. Only once, after the 1840 census, did the number of seats in the House not increase; 1910, however, marked the last time the House grew, even though the U.S. population has more than tripled since then, from over 90 million in 1910 to over 330 million today.</p>

For the first time, <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/geography/urban_and_rural_areas.html#:~:text=The%201920%20census%20marked%20the,population%20was%20defined%20as%20urban." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority of the population lived</a> in “urban” areas. And although the Census Bureau’s definition was broad — it included any place with at least 2,500 people — the finding reflected America’s power center was moving away from rural areas toward urban ones <a href="https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to industrialization</a> and high levels of <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/european-immigrants-united-states-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe</a>. This made the apportionment process particularly challenging, as Congress had to navigate two competing concerns: first, the worry that greater urban power would lead to rural seat loss if the House didn’t expand, and second, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/08/taft-signs-bill-increasing-house-size-to-433-aug-8-1911-761943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing belief</a> among many members that the House was already too crowded and that an increase in seats would make it truly unwieldy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevertheless, the Republican chair of the House Census Committee <a href="https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/House-Arrest-Dan-Bouk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put forward legislation</a> in 1921 to increase the size of the House by 48 seats — 483 in total. Once again, this would have prevented any state from losing a seat, a politically attractive option.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimizing seat loss had long been a major consideration in the apportionment process, to the point that only a handful of states lost any seats in the five apportionments from 1870 to 1910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> But this time both parties were deeply divided over expanding the House, with arguments that adding seats would be too expensive or hinder legislative functions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Congress tried a number of alternatives. First, the House passed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1921/01/20/archives/house-kills-plan-for-increase-to-483-votes-overwhelmingly-for.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an amended bill</a> to keep the House at 435 members. Eleven states stood to lose seats as a result, and unsurprisingly many senators from those states worked behind the scenes to keep that bill from ever getting a vote in the Senate. Next, the House tried to expand to just 460 seats instead of 483, which would have caused only two states to lose a seat, but that narrowly failed by four votes on the House floor. This left Congress at an impasse, and over the next few years, reapportionment stalled. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some rural legislators charged that the timing of the 1920 census presented an inaccurate picture of the country’s population, claiming for instance that many people had migrated to cities only temporarily during World War I but would soon return to rural areas. Others argued that non-citizens ought to be excluded from the counts, which would have primarily affected Northern states with large immigrant populations. Meanwhile, some Northern Republicans, upset by Democrats’ disenfranchisement of Black Americans in the South, countered that representation ought to be reduced in Southern states that suppressed voting rights. There were also arguments over which method was best for <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41382.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apportioning seats,</a> as one method tended to put <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/05/27/in-battle-over-reapportionment-even-math-is-a-target/f540a781-7fda-414c-9e10-d955372556d4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly more seats in less populous states</a> and the other put more seats in more populous states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The lack of consensus on how to reapportion the House meant that by the late 1920s, reapportionment had dragged on for nearly a decade and had <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25110586" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the makings of a constitutional crisis</a>. “The issue began to come to a head as the 1928 election loomed,” said Anderson of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. “Because the realization was, we’ve got the Electoral College apportioned on the basis of the 1910 census, and if the popular vote and the electoral vote diverge, it’s because we didn’t reapportion.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/cuomo-resigning-now-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79389991</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Fortunately for electoral legitimacy, Republican Herbert Hoover won both the popular and electoral vote <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1928&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 1928</a> presidential election. Having served from 1921 to 1928 as secretary of commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau, he was especially cognizant of Congress’s apportionment failure. In April 1929, Hoover called a special session of Congress, where one of the main focuses was apportionment, and by June, legislation had passed both the House and Senate and was signed by Hoover. The law, the Apportionment Act of 1929, created what we know as the “automatic” reapportionment process today. It capped the number of House seats at 435 and moved the responsibility of determining the seat count from Congress to the president — an early example of <a href="https://today.law.harvard.edu/feature/presidential-power-surges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress giving away power</a> to the executive branch.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why even now the secretary of commerce &lt;a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:13%20section:141%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title13-section141)&amp;amp;f=treesort&amp;amp;edition=prelim&amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;jumpTo=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reports apportionment figures&lt;/a&gt; to the president, who then transmits that information to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But given the rancor surrounding reapportionment, the law didn’t come without serious consequences for representation. Specifically, it <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/insights-on-law-and-society/volume-20/issue-2/an-enumeration-of-the-population--a-history-of-the-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut requirements</a> that members be elected in single districts and that those districts be contiguous and compact, serving relatively equal-sized populations. This meant a state that lost seats could now draw wildly disproportionate districts to keep power in more rural parts of the state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It essentially created massive malapportionment for the next 40 years,” said Anderson. But, she stressed, this was done because it made the law “politically palatable.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the law’s lack of a population requirement helps explain why more than half of all members from rural districts backed it, even though most of the states that lost seats were based in the rural South and Midwest.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 21 states lost seats as part of the reapportionment process, and most of them were in the South or Midwest. Meanwhile, the 11 states that gained seats were industrial states like New York and Michigan and fast-growing states mostly in the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> These representatives knew their states might lose seats, but they hedged that their slower-growing or shrinking districts might not end up on the chopping block now that the apportionment process didn’t require districts to have equal populations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Later, to uphold the tenet of “one person, one vote,” the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1963/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would rule</a> that congressional districts must be approximately equal in population, but that wouldn’t happen until 1964. And even then, unequal representation in the House has persisted, largely because the size of the chamber hasn’t budged despite massive growth in the U.S. population.</p>



<hr><h2><strong>The problem with being stuck at 435</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 1910, the largest state, New York, had about 9 million more people than the smallest — that is, least populous — state, Nevada. But today, the largest state, California, has nearly <em>39 million more people</em> than the smallest, Wyoming. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This staggering gap makes it far more likely for states to end up with wildly unequal district populations thanks to the Constitution’s requirement that each state have at least one congressional district. The Supreme Court requires districts to have equal populations, but this applies only to the districts within a state — not between states. So even though the average House district will have just over 760,000 people after this round of reapportionment, each state’s average district will vary quite a bit, especially as states get smaller in size.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Take the smallest and largest states with only one representative: Wyoming and Delaware, respectively. Wyoming, with just under 578,000 people, winds up overrepresented because it’s guaranteed a seat despite falling well short of that 760,000 national average. Conversely, Delaware has nearly 991,000 people, which leaves it underrepresented because it isn’t quite large enough to earn a second seat. Meanwhile, Montana has only about 95,000 more people than Delaware, but that’s enough for the apportionment formula to eke out a second seat, meaning Montana will have two districts to Delaware’s one and an average district size of just over 542,000, making its constituents the most represented in the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">State lines make perfectly equal districts across the country impossible, but there’s no question that increasing the size of the House would help reduce how unequal district sizes among states have become. Expanding the House could also make districts smaller, which in turn could help with representation, as the average number of people living in a congressional district has grown by about 520,000 people from 1920 to 2020 — three times more than the total shift from 1790 to 1910.</p>

On the one hand, this is somewhat understandable given the U.S. has the third-largest population in the world after China and India, the latter of which also happens to be the only democracy with more people per representative than the U.S. But beyond India, other large democracies with more than 100 million people, like Brazil and Japan, offer their constituents far more representation than the U.S. Moreover, their lower legislative chambers are only somewhat bigger than the U.S. House.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Our congressional districts are just massive, there’s really nothing else like it,” said Jonathan Rodden, a <a href="https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/people/jonathan-rodden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political scientist at Stanford University</a> who studies political geography. “The scale of districts in Canada, the U.K. and Australia is so much smaller … the U.S. is really an outlier in this.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brian Frederick, a <a href="https://www.bridgew.edu/department/political-science/dr-brian-frederick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political scientist at Bridgewater State University</a>, studies apportionment issues and <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Congressional-Representation--Constituents-The-Case-for-Increasing-the/Frederick/p/book/9780415873468" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has argued</a> that the House should be expanded. He notes how the size of America’s districts hurts the quality of representation that voters receive. In fact, his research has found a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249692020_Constituency_Population_and_Representation_in_the_US_House" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lot of upsides for smaller districts</a>. For instance, representatives who serve fewer people are more popular, more likely to have contact with their constituents and more likely to get higher marks for their constituent service. Moreover, they often better reflect the views and makeup of the people in their districts. “The reality is that it’s easier to represent fewer people than it is a larger number of citizens on a per-district basis,” said Frederick. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both he and Rodden noted that an expansion of the House could also increase the relative demographic diversity in the House. For instance, having districts with smaller populations could produce a plurality-Native American congressional district in Arizona or New Mexico, which is currently not possible given the size of the group’s population. However, Rodden warned that opportunities to expand representation for minority groups could vary, especially in the South, where Black voters are often <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/09/how-a-widespread-practice-to-politically-empower-african-americans-might-actually-harm-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over-concentrated in districts</a> to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26600481" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ensure representation</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adding seats to the House could have <a href="https://contentdm.washburnlaw.edu/digital/collection/wlj/id/5912/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electoral benefits</a>, too. First, a growing House would make it less likely that states lose representation in the reapportionment process. Under current conditions, states with a shrinking population often lose seats, but this is true even of states where the population is growing.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania all grew about 2 percent between 2010 and 2020, for instance, but all three states still lost seats in the 2020 apportionment process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> An expansion of the House would also help reduce the Electoral College’s bias toward small states, as more populous states would pick up more representatives, and therefore electoral votes in the Electoral College.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A state’s electoral vote count is the total number of representatives plus a state’s two senators. (The current number of electors is also what FiveThirtyEight is named after, so if this happened, we might have to consider a name change. Perhaps SixThirtyEight?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> And finally, a larger House could theoretically <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/download/downloads/id/14402/Why_the_House_Must_Be_Expanded___Democracy_Clinic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help reduce partisan gerrymandering</a>. As Rodden told me, when you add more and more seats, you converge on proportional representation at some point because the districts just become so small. Still, he cautioned that line drawers could get pretty creative, so more districts might not always result in more proportional representation.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Unintentional-Gerrymandering%3A-Political-Geography-Chen-Rodden/05b1766bb58a5419d28dae07e4cbc7e27f2109ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a 2013 paper&lt;/a&gt; that Rodden co-authored, he found that the more districts were added to Florida’s map, the more proportional the partisan split became across those districts, although Republicans still retained an advantage given Democrats’ overconcentration in urban areas. But he didn’t find this pattern everywhere. For instance, his forthcoming study of Pennsylvania’s map didn’t find that adding more districts led to more proportional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>22</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, expanding the House has many potential upsides — many of them beneficial to democracy, too — but, of course, a lot hinges on just how many seats would be added. And on that point there is no easy answer.</p>



<hr><h2><strong>How to expand the House</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">A number of ideas have emerged for how best to expand the House. Some reformers have suggested a one-time, arbitrary fix, like <a href="https://www.amacad.org/ourcommonpurpose/recommendation-1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding 50 seats</a>. Others have argued for a more substantive overhaul, like resizing the House <a href="https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/representation-in-the-house-the-wyoming-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on the population of the smallest state</a> — often called the Wyoming rule, as Wyoming has occupied this position since 1990. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s actually a fairly straightforward solution that isn’t too far off from what America used to do before — albeit unintentionally. It’s known as the <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199287741.001.0001/acprof-9780199287741-chapter-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cube root law</a> in political science, or the fact that the size of a country’s parliament often hews to the <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/cube-root.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cube root</a> of the nation’s population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://ps.ucdavis.edu/people/mshugart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Shugart</a>, a professor emeritus at University of California, Davis, has <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Seats_and_Votes.html?id=DzVsQgAACAAJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to unpack why this is often the case</a>. After all, there is no law that says countries’ parliaments must be the cube root of their population, yet they often are, as the chart below shows. Of the 30 major democracies <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198089/different-democracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shugart and his co-authors looked at</a> alongside the U.S., a majority of them have legislatures very close to — or fairly near — the cube root of their populations.</p>

Its lower legislative chamber, the House of Commons, has 338 seats, almost exactly in line with the cube root law’s expectation of 335 seats. This is in large part because Canada has <a href="https://redecoupage-federal-redistribution.ca/content.asp?section=info&amp;dir=his/rep&amp;document=p1&amp;lang=e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequently adjusted the chamber’s seat count</a> to account for population growth. But other bigger democracies like Brazil and Japan also have seat counts that fall fairly close to the cube root of their respective populations. Of course, this isn’t true of every democracy Shugart and his co-authors studied. Some countries like the U.S. fall well below the cube root of its population. And countries like Australia, India and Israel are even more underrepresented than the U.S. in their legislatures.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower chambers in the case of Australia and India. Israel has a unicameral legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> It’s also the case that some countries like Germany, Italy and the U.K. may actually be <em>overrepresented</em> in their lower chambers — for instance, the U.K.’s House of Commons has 650 seats, well more than the expected 404 seats.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">According to Shugart, the reason why representation in countries’ lower chambers is often so close to the cube root of their populations is that the legislators must strike a balance between communicating with one another and their constituents. “It is about finding what is the optimal size,” he said. And in many countries, that seems to be roughly the cube root of a country’s population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, it’s a pattern the U.S. used to mostly follow until the size of the House was capped at 435 seats in 1929. But as the chart below shows, the House would have to grow to 692 seats to reflect where the cube root law expects representation in the U.S. to be now.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1158" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/skelley.STUCK-AT-435.4.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/skelley.STUCK-AT-435.4.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/skelley.STUCK-AT-435.4.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/skelley.STUCK-AT-435.4.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="1502" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/skelley.STUCK-AT-435.4-mob.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/skelley.STUCK-AT-435.4-mob.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/skelley.STUCK-AT-435.4-mob.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/skelley.STUCK-AT-435.4-mob.png?w=1240 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That would make the House almost 60 percent larger than it is now, so it’s hard to imagine a one-time increase of that scope. Shugart suggested a phased expansion over the next few decades, although he also didn’t think the House necessarily had to get all the way to 692 seats — he just stressed that, according to the cube root law, where the U.S. currently falls suggests that it is dramatically underrepresented. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of the potential benefits of a bigger House, though, there would likely be steep opposition to expanding it because of some of the tradeoffs — and potential downsides — involved. For instance, a larger House would by necessity mean a bigger government and more spending. House members <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/salaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make $174,000 per year</a>, and after five years of service <a href="https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/ac0d1dd5-7316-4390-87e6-353589586a89.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they are also eligible for a pension</a>. Combine that with new staff, new construction for office space, perhaps even a roomier House chamber and you’re talking about <a href="https://www.mattglassman.com/?p=4325" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many millions or even billions of dollars</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There could also be consequences for governing, too, such as more gridlock and partisanship. “By increasing the number of players who have to be satisfied in the legislative game, you make arriving at the kind of majorities — or, in most cases, supermajorities — that you need to pass legislation more difficult,” said <a href="https://harrisburg.psu.edu/faculty-and-staff/l-marvin-overby-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L. Marvin Overby</a>, a political scientist at Pennsylvania State University-Harrisburg who studies Congress and <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/3235166?journalCode=pol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has expressed skepticism</a> toward the promised benefits of House expansion. He also warned that a bigger House might produce fewer competitive seats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ending-gerrymandering-wont-fix-what-ails-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to partisan sorting</a> and fewer representatives open to compromise. “You would have even less of an incentive as an individual member of Congress to try to do things on a bipartisan basis,” said Overby, “because your district would be increasingly homogeneous — increasingly Democratic or increasingly Republican.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As such, even more elections may be effectively decided by primaries instead of general elections than they are today, which is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already the case</a> in the vast majority of House districts. And with more safe seats, incumbents would likely have an even easier time getting reelected than <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/house-primaries-a-little-more-action-this-year-than-usual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they currently do</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, there simply isn’t public support for expansion at this point. In 2018, 51 percent of Americans told the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/04/26/5-the-electoral-college-congress-and-representation/#should-the-allocation-of-senate-seats-or-the-size-of-the-house-be-changed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a> that the size of the House should stay the same, while only 28 percent wanted to expand it (another 18 percent actually wanted to shrink it). Moreover, members of Congress aren’t wild about the idea, either. Legislation <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/996/text?r=7&amp;s=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced in February</a> by Rep. Alcee Hastings of Florida, a Democrat <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/us-rep-alcee-hastings-dies-84-impeached-judge-76899297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who died in April</a>, aims to establish a bipartisan commission to examine the size of the House, among other things. But the bill has only four co-sponsors and <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-alcee-hastings-house-size-electoral-college-20210209-ezlhpnqfq5ag3er6kzz7iwjuzq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks unlikely to go anywhere</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, there are pros and cons to increasing the size of the House, but at the very least, the idea should be more openly debated because, in terms of changes that could be made to our institutions, expanding the House is actually doable. For instance, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-has-always-favored-smaller-states-it-just-didnt-help-republicans-until-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Senate’s small-state bias often gets a lot more attention</a>, but any change to the Senate would require a constitutional amendment whereas the size of the House could be altered with a simple bill.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s going to be difficult to increase the size of the House of Representatives; I’m under no illusions,” said Frederick of Bridgewater State University. Nevertheless, it may be time for a change given how unequal districts have become between states and how underrepresented Americans are after more than 100 years of being stuck at 435 House members. Said Frederick, “There’s no doubt that a larger House with smaller constituency population size per district would improve the representational quality that citizens receive from members of Congress.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the early days of the pandemic, there was a real sense of camaraderie. We were all in this together. We stood on our balconies and stoops and leaned out windows to clap for front-line workers. We stayed home to keep each other safe. Now, that altruistic mentality has reverted to the all-too-familiar mean of tribalism. It can feel like the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthony-fauci-covid-19-unvaccinated-americans-delta-variant-face-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle lines have been drawn</a>: on one side, those who have been vaccinated, and on the other, those who haven’t. </p>

And among those who haven’t, their reasons for not getting the jab vary from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/covid19-vaccine-dashboard/#section-26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns over potential side effects</a>, to a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-58086377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fear of needles</a>, to simply <a href="https://twitter.com/DeNovo_Fatima/status/1424693278469984256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not being able</a> to take time off work. The <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 30 percent</a> of eligible Americans who have yet to be vaccinated are not all anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists, and treating them as such could make them <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/24/how-talk-vaccine-hesitant-friends-family-about-getting-shot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even less likely</a> to get the shot.</p>

<hr><h2><strong>“The vaccine hasn’t been around long enough for me to know it’s safe.” </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that compared to something like a tetanus shot, which has been in use for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly a century</a>, COVID-19 vaccines have a much shorter record of safety. But there are a few things to consider. One is that, due to the pandemic, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions of people</a> have received these vaccines. Collecting data on how a medical intervention impacts <em>billions</em> of people would take decades in any other scenario, but we’ve been able to get it in just a few months. And because these vaccines are new, they are being carefully monitored. It’s how experts were able to identify that the AstraZeneca vaccine carries a small risk of a rare blood clot condition called thrombocytopenia syndrome. The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rare-blood-clot-cases-not-higher-after-astrazeneca-second-dose-study-2021-07-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk is less than 10 in 1 million</a>, yet researchers were able to identify it quickly due to intensive monitoring and the sheer number of people getting their shots. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the first vaccines using mRNA that have been approved, research on this kind of vaccine delivery method has been <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happening for decades</a>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Dendritic%20cell%20immunotherapy%20for%20HIV-1%20infection%20using%20autologous%20HIV-1%20RNA%3A%20a%20randomized%2C%20double-blind%2C%20placebo-controlled%20clinical%20trial&amp;journal=J.%20Acquir.%20Immune%20Def.%20Syndr.&amp;volume=72&amp;pages=31-38&amp;publication_year=2016&amp;author=Jacobson%2CJM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous clinical</a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Immunization%20of%20HIV-1-infected%20persons%20with%20autologous%20dendritic%20cells%20transfected%20with%20mRNA%20encoding%20HIV-1%20Gag%20and%20Nef%3A%20results%20of%20a%20randomized%2C%20placebo-controlled%20clinical%20trial&amp;journal=J.%20Acquir.%20Immune%20Def.%20Syndr.&amp;volume=71&amp;pages=246-253&amp;publication_year=2016&amp;author=Gandhi%2CRT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trials</a> for mRNA vaccines showed the vaccines were safe, with mild side effects like headache or soreness at the injection site. It also might be helpful to know that mRNA (or messenger ribonucleic acid) is not some new, lab-created substance, it’s a <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-mrna-the-messenger-molecule-thats-been-in-every-living-cell-for-billions-of-years-is-the-key-ingredient-in-some-covid-19-vaccines-158511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naturally-occurring molecule</a> that our body produces and uses as part of its daily cellular functions. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re also building on decades of understanding of how vaccines work,” said Namandjé Bumpus, director of the Johns Hopkins University Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences. Part of that understanding includes the fact that adverse side effects from vaccines almost always show up very soon after they’ve been administered — from a few minutes, as in the rare cases of anaphylaxis after the Pfizer and Modern vaccines, to a few weeks, as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01419-1#:~:text=There%20is%20now%20compelling%20evidence,vector%20vaccine%20or%20the%20Ad26." target="_blank" rel="noopener">we saw with</a> the rare blood clot condition. The <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/vaccines-are-highly-unlikely-to-cause-side-effects-long-after-getting-the-shot-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longest time</a> before a side effect appeared for any type of vaccine has been six weeks. And because vaccines are designed to prompt our body to mount its own immune response, the actual vaccine doesn’t stay in our system — our bodies <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/vaccines-are-highly-unlikely-to-cause-side-effects-long-after-getting-the-shot-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process the ingredients</a> in the shot within a day or two. Since the vaccines have been in use for months at this point, any side effects should have emerged. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Could there be unforeseen effects of the vaccines that haven’t yet appeared? Possibly. But as Genevieve Kanter, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the regulation of biomedical technologies, pointed out, the novel coronavirus — and its variants — also haven’t been around very long. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We don’t know the long-term effects of COVID-19, either,” Kanter said. But what we know so far isn’t ideal: <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-long-haulers-long-term-effects-of-covid19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some people who recover from COVID-19</a> have side effects that have lasted for months, including fatigue, breathing difficulties and cognitive impairments. </p>



<hr><h2><strong>“I can still get COVID-19 after getting vaccinated, so there’s no point in getting the shot.” </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since before the vaccines were even available, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/covid-19-vaccine-dont-expect-cure-scientists/story?id=71333281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experts have warned</a> that they wouldn’t be 100 percent effective at preventing infection. Luckily, the vaccines that we ended up with were actually much more effective than what <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/covid-19-vaccine-dont-expect-cure-scientists/story?id=71333281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early predictions suggested</a> — Moderna and Pfizer are both <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better than 90 percent</a>, and Johnson &amp; Johnson is around <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72 percent effective</a> against the original strain of COVID-19 in the U.S. — but since they aren’t 100 percent, that means some vaccinated people can still get COVID-19. Early studies show the vaccines are less effective against the delta variant, with both <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pfizer</a> and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moderna</a> around 90 percent effective against infection, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/science/johnson-delta-vaccine-booster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J&amp;J</a> up to 71 percent effective against hospitalization. And we’re seeing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/delta-variant-most-prevalent/2021/08/08/d1017f0e-f558-11eb-9068-bf463c8c74de_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more breakthrough infections</a> as the delta variant spreads.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevertheless, study after study shows that your risk of getting COVID-19 is much lower if you’re vaccinated than if you’re unvaccinated. In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/react-study-shows-fully-vaccinated-are-three-times-less-likely-to-be-infected" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study published last week</a> that followed over 98,000 people in England from late-June to mid-July, vaccinated individuals were three times less likely to contract COVID-19 than unvaccinated individuals, even as the delta variant dominated cases. In fact, even if you do get infected after vaccination, your risks of getting seriously ill, needing to go in the hospital, needing to go in the intensive care unit or dying are reduced even further. Vaccinated Americans have accounted for less than 0.06 percent of hospitalizations, according to <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-data-from-the-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a review from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, which looked at states that report breakthrough cases. Of the more than <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">166 million Americans</a> who have been vaccinated, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,507 have died after contracting COVID-19</a> — a rate of 0.0009 percent. </p>

<hr><h2><strong>“Vaccinated people can still spread the virus, so it doesn’t make a difference to public health if I’m unvaccinated.”</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our understanding about whether vaccinated individuals can spread the virus to others is still evolving, and though <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/07/30/1022867219/cdc-study-provincetown-delta-vaccinated-breakthrough-mask-guidance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s evidence to suggest that they can</a>, there are still important public health reasons to get a jab. For one, your chances of getting COVID-19 in the first place <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/data-shows-how-rare-severe-breakthrough-covid-infections-are/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are reduced when you’re fully vaccinated</a>, which will in turn limit your likelihood of spreading the virus to someone else — you can’t spread what you don’t have. The more people who are vaccinated, the less easily the virus is able to circulate in the population. This helps protect people who can’t yet be vaccinated, such as children under age 12, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/health/coronavirus-children-delta.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who are being hospitalized at much higher rates</a> than earlier in the pandemic. You may have read about herd immunity and the fact that, for this virus, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/delta-s-spread-seen-pushing-herd-immunity-threshold-above-80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we would need very high levels of immunity</a> to reach that point. But Namandjé Bumpus, director of the department of pharmacology and molecular sciences at Johns Hopkins University, pointed out that regardless of whether we reach herd immunity, a more vaccinated population will lessen the spread of COVID-19 — a 70 percent vaccination rate is still better than 60 percent, which is better than 50 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Herd immunity is not this magic number where suddenly a bell will be rung across the country,” Bumpus said. “Every person counts.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But perhaps even more important for public health is the fact that fewer infections provide less opportunity for the virus to mutate into new, potentially more deadly, strains. Each time the novel coronavirus infects a person, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-the-coronavirus-mutates-and-what-this-means-for-the-future-of-covid-19-154499" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it replicates inside the body</a>. When the virus duplicates, it sometimes makes an exact copy of itself, and other times its copies have a slight mutation. Sometimes these mutations make the virus weaker, and other times, they make it stronger — such as being better able to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02039-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attach to our cells</a> — according to Dr. Jonathan Li, director of the Harvard/Brigham Virology Specialty Laboratory at Harvard University.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every time the virus infects a new person, there’s a chance it can find a mutation that benefits itself,” Li said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those beneficial mutations are what allow the novel coronavirus to evolve into new variants, including the delta variant, which is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/07/delta-variant-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 50 percent more contagious</a> than the original strain of the virus. New variants may be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00121-z%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">able to evade our immune responses</a>, rendering our existing vaccines less effective (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as with</a> delta) or making it easier for unvaccinated people to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/unvaccinated-more-than-twice-as-likely-to-get-covid-19-again-cdc-says-11628276064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get COVID-19 a second time</a>. By getting vaccinated, you’ll reduce the likelihood that you’ll get an infection, denying the virus a new opportunity to mutate and get stronger. And even if you do get a rare breakthrough infection, the <a href="https://news.arizona.edu/story/covid-19-vaccine-reduces-severity-length-viral-load-those-who-still-get-infected" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccines help reduce</a> the length and severity of infection, meaning you’re still reducing the time the virus has to mutate. </p>



<hr><h2><strong>“The vaccines haven’t been fully approved by the FDA.”</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true, none of the vaccines currently in use have been fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, they have all been granted emergency use authorization, which is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not an easy hurdle to clear</a>, and is constantly monitored — the FDA could <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/recalls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revoke this authorization</a> at any time if safety concerns arose. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/pfizer-vaccine-approval.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All signs suggest the FDA will fully approve</a> these vaccines within the coming months. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the reason the process has taken so long is because <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA required six months</a> of safety data to consider full approval, so we needed to wait until enough time had passed to collect the data. That means the process for granting full approval requires a “longer follow-up, [but] not necessarily more rigorous review,” said Susan S. Ellenberg, a former FDA official and a professor emeritus of biostatistics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who was on the Operation Warp Speed Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Given the urgency of a deadly pandemic, the emergency use authorization was granted to make sure we could get access to these vaccines sooner rather than later. Plus, if the FDA had rushed the full approval process, it may have eroded trust in the vaccines, rather than increased it, according to Ravina Kullar, an infectious disease expert and fellow at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p>



<hr><h2><strong>“I already had COVID-19, so I’m immune and don’t need the vaccine.” </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having a bout of COVID-19 does provoke an immune response, but <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/people-who-already-had-covid-19-should-still-get-vaccinated-scientists-urge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we still don’t know</a> how robust that response is or how long it lasts. It’s an unknown, whereas the vaccines are well studied and understood, so you can be assured your shot will give you a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-coronavirus-pandemic-ad52011f4ca1853fad6eee41a7310c2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong immune response</a>. It also isn’t as easy to confirm that you’ve had COVID-19 as it is to confirm that you’ve been vaccinated, which could pose problems for travel or work, depending on requirements. </p>



<hr><h2><strong>“I heard the vaccine can cause infertility.” </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a lot of rumors about potential scary side effects from the vaccine, and the ones around fertility are particularly frightening. However, there is no evidence that the vaccines cause any fertility risks — in fact, <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/science-in-5/episode-24---vaccine-myths-vs-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no vaccine in history</a> has ever caused infertility. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pregnant people are also at a higher risk</a> of more severe COVID-19 infections, so getting vaccinated is especially prudent if you might become pregnant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One version of this rumor <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-syncytin-idUSKBN2A42S7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be based on a confusion</a> between two types of proteins. The novel coronavirus attaches to the cells in our body using spike proteins. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) are designed to prompt our body to produce these spike proteins so that our immune system can learn how to identify them and attack them in case we come in contact with the virus. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/28/coronavirus-vaccines-dont-cause-infertility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some people have confused these spike proteins</a> with a completely different kind of protein called syncytin-1, which is part of placenta formation during pregnancy. They claimed the vaccine will cause our immune system to attack syncytin-1, causing infertility or miscarriages. This is not true. Syncytin-1 and the spike protein are immunologically very different, and our body can easily distinguish between the two, according to Ravina Kullar, an infectious disease expert and member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There is one small similarity, but the overall construction of the protein is completely different,” Kullar said. “Our immune system is way too smart to be confused by that.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Aug. 14, 2021, 1 p.m.): </strong>A previous version of this article compared COVID-19 deaths in all vaccinated Americans, regardless of infection, to the death rate for all infected Americans. That comparison has been removed.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">After New York Attorney General <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.08.03_nyag_-_investigative_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letitia James’s report</a> found that Gov. Andrew Cuomo had violated state and federal law by <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/Attorney-general-concludes-Cuomo-sexually-16359949.php?IPID=Times-Union-HP-CP-Spotlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexually harassing 11 women</a>, Cuomo <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-andrew-cuomo-resign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed intent</a> on riding it out. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just last week <a href="https://apnews.com/article/andrew-cuomo-investigation-sexual-harassment-04b0e7ba80db368124a5e9c9bcf4dc0d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he denied the report’s charges</a> and said that he wouldn’t resign. But with <a href="https://abc7ny.com/andrew-cuomo-biden-resign-attorney-general-letitia-james/10927344/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Democrats, including President Biden</a>, calling for his resignation, an impending impeachment investigation in the state legislature and public opinion now solidly against him, it all became too much for Cuomo. On Tuesday, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/andrew-cuomo-resign-york-governor-sexual-harassment-allegations/story?id=76171581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he announced his resignation</a>, effective Aug. 24.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When the allegations of sexual harassment first broke earlier this year, one of Cuomo’s political saving graces was that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/4-ways-andrew-cuomos-political-future-could-play-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public opinion hadn’t turned against him</a>. But in the aftermath of the report’s release, that quickly changed. Polls found that <a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Marist-Poll_NYS-NOS-and-Tables_202108040647-2.pdf#page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anywhere from 60</a> to <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent</a> of New Yorkers thought Cuomo should resign or that the state legislature should start impeachment proceedings if he didn’t resign, including a majority of Democrats. With such strong opposition within his own party, Cuomo had few options available to him. He had reportedly tried <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/8/9/22616581/cuomo-impeachment-seeking-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to reach a backroom deal</a> whereby he wouldn’t seek reelection in exchange for avoiding impeachment, but that clearly doesn’t seem to have been an option. The state legislature had been in the process of moving ahead with impeachment proceedings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-scandals-hurt-candidates-running-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some politicians have survived scandals</a>, but as my colleague Nathaniel Rakich has previously noted, politicians faced with charges of sexual harassment <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/4-ways-andrew-cuomos-political-future-could-play-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been forced out at a higher rate</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-people-are-resigning-from-congress-than-at-any-time-in-recent-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after the #MeToo movement in 2017</a>, when claims of sexual harassment and misconduct in the work place have been taken more seriously.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cuomo posed a serious liability to his own party. Sexual harassment is something that Americans, especially Democrats, view as a significant problem. In 2019, 80 percent of Democrats <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/247901/americans-views-sexual-harassment-workplace-victimization-trends.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Gallup that they thought sexual harassment was a major problem</a>, while 62 percent of Americans overall thought the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it was also easier for Democrats to push for Cuomo’s resignation because his successor, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, wasn’t herself mired in scandal, and as a Democrat, she would also keep the party in charge of the state. By comparison, one big reason the Democratic governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, didn’t resign following his <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/resisting-calls-to-resign-northam-denies-hes-in-racist-yearbook-photo-admits-he-appeared-in/article_f75d342d-e028-586e-8631-70d52424d604.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blackface scandal in 2019 was that his immediate successors, both Democrats, all</a> had their own problems: the lieutenant governor <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/4/18210638/justin-fairfax-ralph-northam-virginia-sex-assault-allegation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced multiple sexual assault allegations</a> and the attorney general had <a href="https://wamu.org/story/19/02/06/virginia-ag-mark-herring-admits-to-blackface-photo-from-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his own blackface scandal</a>. Had Democrats pushed for all three to step down, the governorship might have ended up in Republican hands. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hochul makes history now as the first woman governor of New York, but given she only has 15 months left to serve in Cuomo’s term, this also puts the 2022 New York gubernatorial election under a cloud of uncertainty as Cuomo — especially prior to the allegations — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-government-and-politics-campaigns-coronavirus-pandemic-0eca65bc9468ec773628c4045a8470ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was expected to mount a bid for a fourth term</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Hochul runs, the fact that she is an unelected incumbent could make for an interesting electoral dynamic. Right now, she’s not terribly well known — about half of New York’s registered voters in <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent Quinnipiac University poll</a> said they didn’t have an opinion of her job performance. That gives Hochul an opening to make an impression with voters, but she doesn’t have much time. The 2022 campaign is already underway, and even though unelected gubernatorial incumbents who run for a full term have <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/stepping-up-how-governors-who-have-succeeded-to-the-top-job-have-performed-over-the-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to win their party’s nomination</a>, they also are more vulnerable to a primary challenge than elected incumbents. And in a blue state like New York, there are a number of high-profile Democrats who might throw their hat in the ring. That said, it’s early yet, and we still don’t even know if Hochul will run. But for now, we’re keeping an eye on what New Yorkers think of Hochul and what that means for the race for the governor’s mansion in 2022.</p>]]></description>

He will be replaced by Lieutenant Gov. Kathy Hochul, who will become the first female governor of New York. In this emergency installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast, the crew talks about what led to Cuomo’s resignation, how New Yorkers feel about his replacement and what this means for New York’s 2022 Democratic primary race for governor.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Critical race theory is quickly becoming <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/06/24/critical-race-theory-fox-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Republican Party’s favorite culture-war cudgel.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From April to mid-July, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-obsession-critical-race-theory-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News mentioned it nearly 2,000 times</a>, per Media Matters, a left-leaning media watchdog that tracks right-leaning media outlets. In fact, since February, mentions of the theory have more than doubled month-over-month on Fox News with prominent Republicans, including former <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/06/18/trump-says-critical-race-theory-borders-on-psychological-abuse/?sh=3086eaba450e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Donald Trump</a>, former <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mike-pence-gop-critical-race-theory-state-sanctioned-racism-1604033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vice President Mike Pence</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-race-and-ethnicity-government-and-politics-education-74d0af6c52c0009ec3fa3ee9955b0a8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/559208-ted-cruz-says-critical-race-theory-is-as-racist-as-klansmen-in-white-sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Ted Cruz</a>, all railing against it.        </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The attacks aren’t merely rhetorical, either. According to a July report from the Brookings Institute, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/07/02/why-are-states-banning-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight states</a> (Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona and South Carolina) have passed laws banning critical race theory-related content from being taught in schools. Similar legislation has been <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced in over a dozen other state capitols</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Few Americans can define what <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/many-americans-embrace-falsehoods-about-critical-race-theory-2021-07-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a> actually is — an academic framework that <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originated among legal scholars in the 1970s</a> to help explain how racism permeates American institutions — but it’s not surprising that it has emerged as a bogeyman on the political right. Increasingly, the Republican base is politically animated by white racial grievances, which is a major reason why misrepresentations of critical race theory — “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/559208-ted-cruz-says-critical-race-theory-is-as-racist-as-klansmen-in-white-sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every white person is racist</a>” or “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/15/scholar-strategy-how-critical-race-theory-alarms-could-convert-racial-anxiety-into-political-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain children are inherently bad people because of their skin color</a>” — have found such a receptive audience. After all, many of the same grievances helped fuel Trump’s rise. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From the earliest days of his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/03/how-political-science-helps-explain-the-rise-of-trump-the-role-of-white-identity-and-grievances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support has been most heavily concentrated</a> among white Americans who think they face significant racial discrimination. In fact, perceived anti-white discrimination powerfully predicted voter preferences in the 2016 general election. One <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/discrimination-race-religion_n_5833761ee4b099512f845bba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> conducted shortly after the election found Trump voters were over four times more likely than Clinton voters <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/discrimination-race-religion_n_5833761ee4b099512f845bba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to say white Americans face “a lot” of discrimination</a> (45 percent versus 10 percent, respectively); other polls also consistently showed that Republicans and Trump’s 2016 supporters <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/racial-justice-2020-george-floyd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw racial discrimination</a> against white people as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/08/02/discrimination-against-whites-was-a-core-concern-of-trumps-base/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bigger problem than unfair treatment of racial and ethnic minorities</a> in American society. Those views have only grown more pronounced in Republican politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, the chart below, which draws on data from the American National Election Studies, shows that support for the Republican presidential candidate has steadily grown by 12-to-15 percentage points since 2012 among white Americans who think there’s at least a moderate amount of anti-white discrimination in the U.S.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the reverse is true among white Americans who don’t think there’s much anti-white discrimination: Support for the Republican presidential candidate has steadily dropped. The same pattern holds even after accounting for several factors that are also strongly correlated with presidential vote choice, such as partisanship, ideology and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_resentment_scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial resentment</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is still a relatively new phenomenon in our politics, however. For instance, I found in my research with fellow political scientists John Sides and Lynn Vavreck that perceptions of anti-white discrimination <a href="https://unherd.com/2019/01/trumps-white-identity-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were not as predictive of voters’ preferences</a> in elections immediately preceding 2016, after controlling for other relevant factors. With Trump’s rise in 2016, perceived anti-white discrimination became a significantly more powerful predictor of voting behavior with the same controls in place.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, white grievance politics now explains more than just vote choice. Sides, Vavreck and I <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwsslcf9zzcudz9/white%20identity21.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in a 2021 working paper</a> that perceived anti-white discrimination increasingly predicts public opinion of people and policies connected to the former president, like Pence or repealing the Affordable Care Act. We also find that perceived anti-white discrimination is increasingly associated with Americans’ partisan attachments, much the way public opinion of Barack Obama often spilled over into <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1017/s0022381612000904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Black</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10659129211007211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islamophobic attitudes</a> that would shape party identification during his presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These findings dovetail with the important research of Duke University political scientist Ashley Jardina. Her book, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/white-identity-politics/5C330931FF4CF246FCA043AB14F5C626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“White Identity Politics</a>,” argues that white racial grievances more strongly influence political beliefs when white people perceive themselves as under threat, which is one reason why Trump was so effective in his <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trumps-use-of-white-identity-politics-strategic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many appeals</a> to the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-stephen-miller-capitalize-white-america-s-fear-its-racial-ncna1102081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/us/politics/donald-trump-white-identity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/06/21/donald-trump-is-a-symbol-of-white-identity-politics-in-europe-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical threats</a> that they were supposedly facing. And Republican attacks on critical race theory follow the same playbook, framing its teachings as an anti-white “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existential threat to the United States</a>.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican politics have become so animated by white victimhood in the Trump era that any honest accounting of racial injustice in U.S. history is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-politics-of-white-liberals-and-white-conservatives-are-shaped-by-whiteness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost certain to draw conservative ire</a>. Indeed, I found that the share of Republicans who think there’s too much Black history taught in schools <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/28/democrats-and-republicans-are-increasingly-divided-on-the-value-of-teaching-black-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased by 30 percentage points</a> from 2000 to 2018. But when you combine the rise of white identity politics in the GOP with its mischaracterization of critical race theory as tantamount to anti-white indoctrination, it’s even easier to see how a relatively obscure framework emerged as a leading issue in Republican Party politics. Moreover, the war on critical race theory suggests that the white grievance politics Trump helped activate isn’t going anywhere; rather, it’s a key part of the GOP strategy moving forward.  </p>]]></description>
