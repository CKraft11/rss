<p data-paragraph="main">After the disastrous Iowa caucuses in 2020 and years of grumbling before that, the Democratic National Committee entertained a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-nevada-voted-first-in-the-democratic-presidential-primaries-or-new-jersey-hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draft proposal</a> that would shake up which states vote first on the presidential primary calendar. Ultimately, the proposal wasn’t considered at the DNC’s meeting in March, but the conversation isn’t going away. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew debates which states should vote first. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also look at a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/politics-television-realistic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new survey</a> suggesting that most Americans think “The West Wing” and other political TV shows accurately reflect how politics works. And FiveThirtyEight contributor Laura Bronner joins to discuss where public opinion stands on accepting Ukrainian refugees after the White House announced last week that the U.S. would admit up to 100,000.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">By any measure, the past two years have been rough. This month, we marked the two-year anniversary of the nation’s first shutdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19. The coronavirus pandemic has caused <a href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 6 million global deaths</a> since its beginning, including <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly a million in the United States</a>, and continues to kill <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of people</a> in this country every day. As a nation, we have yet to fully reckon with the sheer scale of the loss. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even before the virus arrived, though, there was political strife in the United States. The pandemic hit at the tail end of five tumultuous and divisive years that saw former President Donald Trump’s arrival on the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2021/01/29/how-america-changed-during-donald-trumps-presidency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national political stage and his first presidential term</a>. The pandemic persisted through his reelection campaign against now-President Joe Biden and then Trump’s failed attempt to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2022/01/06/1070610129/photos-one-year-later-a-look-back-on-the-jan-6-insurrection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn the results when he lost</a>. All of this helped shine a spotlight on the racist systems, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police violence</a>, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/anti-immigrant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xenophobia</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/business/economy/coronavirus-pandemic-income-inequality.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">income</a> and <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/december/has-wealth-inequality-changed-over-time-key-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealth</a> inequalities that had long made life in the United States more difficult for Black Americans, new immigrants and low-income families. In many cases, these forces are now getting worse.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The economic fallout from the pandemic and attendant shutdowns and disruptions has widened a divide between <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-pandemic-hurt-low-wage-workers-the-most-and-so-far-the-recovery-has-helped-them-the-least/#:~:text=Many%20low-wage%20jobs%2C%20such,risk%20of%20contracting%20COVID-19." target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-wage workers</a> — who have been forced to keep working in person, leaving them vulnerable to the virus and <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-2020-employment-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial troubles</a> — and high-wage workers. Behind all of this, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/02/1033054816/our-future-on-a-hotter-planet-means-more-climate-disasters-happening-simultaneou" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> has caused more flooding in Gulf Coast states, wildfires in the West and other problems worldwide. Now, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine feels even more destabilizing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So given all of this, how are Americans doing?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The answer is, surprisingly, kind of OK. People in general are resilient and optimistic and can find ways to thrive even in the worst of times. But that doesn’t mean that Americans are optimistic about the direction of the country. This was hinted at in a January Gallup poll in which <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389375/satisfaction-own-life-five-times-higher.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a full 85 percent</a> of respondents said they were satisfied with their own lives, while only 17 percent were satisfied with the direction of the country. That disconnect, though, isn’t unusual. Since Gallup began asking that question in the 1980s, the share of Americans who say they’re “somewhat” or “very” satisfied with their personal lives has been fairly stable, ranging anywhere from 73 percent to 90 percent, while satisfaction in the direction of the country has generally been lower and less stable.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans rate their lives better than the country's direction" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NWC1d/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Inside this vast divide, I found deeper issues, both in the ways we think about well-being and also in the true state of American lives, through conversations with seven therapists and clinical psychologists. The clinicians I spoke with were part of a larger group of 1,320 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/16/well/mental-health-crisis-america-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in a November 2021 survey</a> from The New York Times and Psychology Today about what they’d seen in their practices. I also spoke to an expert on <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global happiness</a> and looked at global measures of other <a href="https://www.gallup.com/analytics/349280/gallup-global-emotions-report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I believe the human capacity to adapt is beautiful,” said <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/leah-seeger-minneapolis-mn/331591" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leah Seeger</a>, a marriage and family therapist based in Minneapolis. “Even though things are hard, people always adapt to their circumstances.” But at the same time, <a href="http://sociology.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/keyes-corey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corey Lee M. Keyes</a>, a sociologist at Emory University who has long studied the concepts of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12096700/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">languishing and flourishing</a> to better describe how mental health often falls on a spectrum, sounded a note of caution in our email correspondence: “Humans can adapt and get used to things and can lower standards and aspirations to feel good,” he wrote. But “[a]dapting to things was meant to be a short term thing, not long term.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png" alt="" width="268" height="100" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png?w=268 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png?w=536 2x"></figure></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The therapists I spoke with told me that at the beginning of the pandemic, in the spring of 2020, they first worked to help clients stabilize their lives, during what was meant to be a brief lockdown, to prevent the virus from spreading while the nation developed the tools to fight it. But as the pandemic dragged on, and schools, businesses and families had to find ways to operate while keeping people safe, a collective strain began to show up in different ways. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the pandemic is a global phenomenon, it has also become an intensely personal experience for many. More than two years in, people continue to report higher levels of <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2022/march-2022-survival-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a> after the number of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/well/mind/therapy-appointments-shortages-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking mental health care in the U.S.</a> surged during the first year of the pandemic compared to 2019. The therapists I spoke with said they still have more demand than they can meet. Last year, Gallup reported that 2020 <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/352205/2020-sets-records-negative-emotions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set a record for negative emotions</a> worldwide.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pollster creates the index based on an annual survey of adults from over 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a>  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the pandemic also showed us how volatile swings in emotion could be. <a href="https://www.gallup.com/175196/gallup-healthways-index-methodology.aspx#:~:text=Gallup%20and%20Sharecare%20in%202012,to%20measure%20well-being%20worldwide." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup’s tracking of well-being</a> has followed the relative ups and downs of the pandemic closely, showing a record low in April 2020, near the beginning of the pandemic, when only <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388682/life-ratings-retreat-close-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 percent</a> of respondents reported themselves as “thriving.” The share of those who said they were thriving stayed low, too, as unemployment claims and the daily death toll rose in 2020. But then the numbers began to creep up again as vaccines became available and the economy began reopening by the end of 2020. The thriving group rose to a 14-year high <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388682/life-ratings-retreat-close-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the first half</a> of 2021, when it looked like the pandemic may end. But then, of course, the delta variant arrived in another deadly wave, and the number of Americans who said they were thriving dropped once again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other signs that Americans are struggling have emerged. For instance, there’s been an increase in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2021/20211117.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drug overdose deaths</a>, which were already alarmingly high pre-pandemic. The U.S. also has <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a relatively low life expectancy</a>, which impacts overall well-being, compared to other wealthy countries. The murder rate has also risen sharply, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/upshot/murder-rise-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spiking around 30 percent</a> from 2019 to 2020, although it remains relatively low compared to the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s. “I would make the argument that these are symptoms of a sick society,” said <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/david-goldberg-birmingham-al/32235" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Goldberg</a>, a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The sickness is also apparent in Americans’ divided assessment of the country’s structural racism and how to address it. Officer Derek Chauvin’s <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/crime-law-and-justice/killing-of-george-floyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">murder of George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/22/invisible-black-women-death-race-gender-disadvantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police shooting of Breonna Taylor</a> in Louisville sparked a widespread Black Lives Matter movement for racial justice in 2020, and later that year we saw the election of Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to hold the office. In 2022, meanwhile, President Biden nominated the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose confirmation hearings were <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/3/22/22991834/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson-republican-josh-hawley-ted-cruz-child-pornography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full of nasty attacks on her record</a>, ranging from racist dog whistles to QAnon conspiracy theories. As my colleague Alex Samuels and FiveThirtyEight contributor Neil Lewis Jr. recently wrote, these steps toward racial justice <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have often caused a backlash from white Americans</a>, especially white Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The pandemic also coincided with a rise in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-339-percent-nationwide-last-year-repo-rcna14282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Asian and anti-Asian American violence</a>. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/pooja-sharma-berkeley-ca/466634" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pooja Sharma</a>, a clinical psychologist in Berkeley, California, who sees many patients of Asian and South Asian descent, said that has weighed heavily on many of her clients. “They’re just feeling like, ‘We just don’t know where we fit in,’” she said. “It feels like the world is a heavy place.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While these issues existed before the pandemic, it can feel as though the pandemic has exacerbated them. “We have this Republican and Democrat divide,” Goldberg said. “We have the poor and rich divide, and it seems like we now increasingly have this divide between those who are healthy and those who are immunocompromised,” he said. “I’ve got several patients who are immunocompromised, and they feel terribly betrayed and alone,” by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2022/03/01/us/mask-mandates-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the relaxing of mitigation measures</a> like mask mandates.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png" alt="" width="268" height="100" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png?w=268 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png?w=536 2x"></figure></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The disruptions themselves weren’t all bad for Americans’ happiness. Many of the therapists I spoke with said that people who were forced to stay at home had no choice but to face what was already going wrong with their lives, which may have led to an opportunity for personal growth for some. “What happened is that the pandemic was like this big magnifying glass,” said <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/gabriela-sehinkman-beachwood-oh/339530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gabriela Sehinkman</a>, a clinical social worker in Ohio. Some of the signs of distress — seeking therapy, getting a divorce, <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/03/the-great-resignation-or-the-great-rethink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quitting a job</a> — might be people finally dealing with long-simmering problems rather than just struggling through the day. “It forced us to really recalibrate priorities,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For that to happen, though, people need resources to change their lives, like access to therapy or the financial security to seek a new job. Seeger said happiness is a higher-order pursuit: If people are struggling to maintain their housing, suffering from food insecurity or have lost income, then they can’t seek happiness. Indeed, many Americans haven’t had the chance for that reassessment, as they’ve had to keep reporting to work at grocery stores or health care facilities as per usual. The effects of the pandemic <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-reminded-us-of-just-how-unequal-america-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were distributed unequally</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Happiness Report</a>, a yearly report published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network that gets much of its data from the Gallup World Poll, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2016/HR-V1Ch2_web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in 2016</a> that countries with high levels of income,wealth and well-being inequality also had lower levels of overall happiness overall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the most important resources to securing happiness, though, is a sense of community, according to John Helliwell, an author of this year’s report. And the U.S. <a href="https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/Appendix_1_StatiscalAppendix_Ch2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does worse</a> on this metric than the happiest countries: American respondents ranked 25th out of 146 countries when it came to the share who said they could rely on someone in times of trouble and 98th on the level of perceived corruption in their government and business institutions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Helliwell told me that the countries that rank highly overall score well on every measure they ask about, but that a lack of social support networks, lack of trust in each other and lack of trust in institutions is important in determining overall happiness scores. Social trust, though, was declining in the U.S. even before the pandemic, and Americans told <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/07/22/trust-and-distrust-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pew Research Center in 2018</a> that declining trust in government and in each other was making it harder to solve many of the country’s problems.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Each year, the World Happiness Report ranks countries according to answers from Gallup's World Poll. The United States ranks well below many <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/happiness-benevolence-and-trust-during-covid-19-and-beyond/#ranking-of-happiness-2019-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European countries</a> and just below Canada, where Helliwell lives. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Focusing on individual well-being instead of rebuilding trust in communities and institutions is very American, Helliwell said. “It turns out that if people are doing something just to make themselves happy, it won’t,” he said. “What really makes you happy is doing the right thing and helping others.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the therapists I spoke to echoed the idea that Americans have been too siloed in their lives and missing a sense of community belonging, especially during the past two years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There is this really deep messaging in our country … around, ‘I should be happy alone. I should be happy on my own. And If I’m not happy on my own, I need to do more work to be able to be happy on my own,’” said <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/emily-fasten-san-francisco-ca/207058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily Fasten</a>, a marriage and family therapist in San Francisco. “And I challenge that, because I do think we need our relationships, and cultivating relationships is a very satisfying aspect of life.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When taken to the extreme, this emphasis on the individual can lead to a sense of social isolation, alienation and loneliness. FiveThirtyEight contributor Daniel Cox, a research fellow for polling and public opinion at the American Enterprise Institute, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-social-alienation-among-some-trump-supporters-help-explain-why-polls-underestimated-trump-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has found that many Americans increasingly feel socially isolated</a>. Before the 2020 election, 17 percent of Americans said they had no one they were close with, a 9-point increase from a similar poll in 2013. Cox wrote that social isolation is linked with distrust in social institutions and democratic processes. This likely complicated our national response to the pandemic; according to Helliwell and other authors of the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/happiness-trust-and-deaths-under-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 World Happiness Report</a>, a countries with less trust in social institutions tended to have higher death rates from the coronavirus; the institutional failure to protect people from death and illness fed into further distrust, creating a vicious cycle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this way, the direction of the country and the satisfaction of our personal lives has become intertwined. “How someone’s individual life is going, it’s always tempered, at least in my clients, by the sort of anxiety or fear of what the future is going to look like and what’s going to be possible,” Fasten said. “And that is definitely influencing people’s ability to be happy and make choices.” </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson are now over. And they were incredibly ugly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In advance of the hearings, my colleague Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-racism-and-sexism-could-define-ketanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote that Jackson’s identity as a Black woman</a> as well as her professional background as a former public defender meant that it was likely she’d be subjected to more questions regarding her qualifications than another nominee would be. And sure enough, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee wasted little time grilling Jackson — often in ways that suggested women and people of color are less qualified than their white counterparts, or that their race makes them inherently biased against white people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were attacks both <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ketanji-brown-jackson-georgetown-day_n_623a04c6e4b0c727d484145b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inside</a> — and <a href="https://theweek.com/supreme-court/1011637/gop-tweet-linking-ketanji-brown-jackson-with-critical-race-theory-draws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside</a> — of the hearings that tried to paint Jackson as a supporter of critical race theory, a legal framework for understanding systemic racism that the GOP has co-opted as a catch-all term for anything related to race. Her judicial record in cases involving child pornography was also heavily scrutinized, even though there is no evidence that she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/us/politics/judge-jackson-child-sexual-abuse-fact-check.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncommonly soft</a> in her sentences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We don’t know yet whether the hearings will dramatically alter Americans’ support of Jackson, but at this point, many Americans support her confirmation. Per a March 1-18 poll from Gallup, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/390956/supreme-court-nominee-jackson-support-tied-highest.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58 percent of Americans said</a> the Senate should vote to confirm Jackson, versus 30 percent who thought she should not be confirmed and 12 percent who had no opinion. Notably, that’s the second-highest level of support that Gallup has recorded for a Supreme Court nominee dating back to Robert Bork’s nomination in 1987.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four nominees for whom Gallup didn’t collect data: Stephen Breyer, Douglas Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> Only Chief Justice John Roberts scored higher than Jackson, and only <em>slightly</em> higher — 59 percent of Americans said they supported his nomination in 2005.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For weeks now, anywhere from a plurality to a majority of Americans have said that they support confirming Jackson. No polls have been conducted entirely after the start of the confirmation hearings — but nine different polls have found plurality support for Jackson’s confirmation since Jackson was announced as the nominee<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes a Mar. 19-22 poll &lt;a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/l8ynsbxwgl/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from The Economist/YouGov&lt;/a&gt;, a March 18-21 poll &lt;a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/21121154/2203138_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Morning Consult/Politico&lt;/a&gt;, a March 17-20 poll &lt;a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/02ak9bdo3h/tabs_Supreme_Court_Hearing_20220317.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from YouGov&lt;/a&gt;, a March 11-14 poll &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017f-9039-d4fc-a1ff-bebff8c90004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Morning Consult/Politico&lt;/a&gt;, a March 7-13 poll &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/17/more-support-than-oppose-jacksons-supreme-court-nomination-with-many-not-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, a March 4-6 poll &lt;a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/08161506/2203034_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Morning Consult/Politico&lt;/a&gt;, a Feb. 26-March 1 poll &lt;a href="https://civiqs.com/documents/Civiqs_DailyKos_monthly_banner_book_2022_02_ce91w4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Civiqs&lt;/a&gt;, a Feb. 26-March 1 poll &lt;a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/aa58ig9d3b/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from The Economist/YouGov&lt;/a&gt; and a Feb. 25-27 poll &lt;a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/28114405/2202168_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Morning Consult/Politico&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> and five more have found <em>majority</em> support for it.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes the aforementioned Gallup poll, a March 2-7 poll &lt;a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/WSJPOLL032022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from The Wall Street Journal/Impact Research/Fabrizio, Lee &amp;amp; Associates&lt;/a&gt;, a March 3-7 poll from &lt;a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-support-judge-kentanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-to-the-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Navigator,&lt;/a&gt; a March 10-14 poll &lt;a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3839" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Quinnipiac University&lt;/a&gt; and a March 10-14 poll &lt;a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_032122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Monmouth University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">But while Jackson has enjoyed majority support in many polls, there’s likely a ceiling to her approval since political polarization has made the process of selecting Supreme Court justices <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-harder-than-ever-to-confirm-a-supreme-court-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more contentious</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for Jackson’s nomination among Democrats has been particularly high, sometimes clocking upward 70 percent in the polls we looked at, but Republicans’ views have been much more divided. For instance, Morning Consult/Politico found in late February that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/22/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-confirmation-hearing-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 percent of Republicans thought</a> that the Senate should confirm Jackson, while 30 percent opposed her nomination. But across three subsequent polls in March, support was lower among Republicans and opposition was higher, hovering in the mid-to-high 30s. Polls from The Economist/YouGov, dating from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/aa58ig9d3b/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 26-March 1</a> and <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/l8ynsbxwgl/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 19-22</a>, found a similar trend — but with greater levels of opposition among Republicans. In the earlier poll, 45 percent opposed confirming Jackson, but this figure grew to 52 percent in the later poll. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent Supreme Court nominees haven’t received the same level of support they once did from Congress, either. Of the seven justices confirmed since Stephen Breyer, only Roberts has received more than 69 percent of the Senate voting in favor of confirmation. He is also the only justice among those seven to have earned the backing of a majority of the other party’s senators.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/595822-the-three-republicans-who-voted-to-confirm-brown-jackson-for-appeals-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Republican senators backed Jackson’s nomination</a> to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last year, but as evidenced by the tenor of this week’s hearings, there’s little chance Jackson garners more — or even the same level of — Republican support this time around.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If confirmed, Jackson would be the first Black female Supreme Court justice, and as such, many Americans think her nomination is historic. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/17/more-support-than-oppose-jacksons-supreme-court-nomination-with-many-not-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A March 7-13 poll</a> from the Pew Research Center found that 66 percent of Americans thought Jackson’s nomination was at least somewhat important. And <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_032122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a March 10-14 poll</a> from Monmouth University found that 53 percent of Americans approved of Biden prioritizing the nomination of a Black woman. But one Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/bidens-promise-to-nominate-a-black-woman-to-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from Feb. 18-21</a>, which predates Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/kbj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nomination</a> of Jackson, found lower levels of support for his promise to appoint a Black woman. Fifty-two percent of Americans said it was at least somewhat important to them that a Black woman become a Supreme Court justice, while 48 percent said it was not very or not at all important to them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Black Americans, Jackson’s nomination has been especially important. For instance, that Pew survey found that 90 percent of Black adults said having a Black woman on the Supreme Court would be at least somewhat important to them, compared with 66 percent of adults overall. And even though the AP/NORC poll found that a smaller share of Americans thought it was important a Black woman be nominated to the court, 85 percent of Black Americans said in that poll that it was at least somewhat important to them. But as my colleague Alex Samuels wrote earlier this week, this is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ketanji-brown-jacksons-nomination-may-not-be-enough-to-turn-out-black-voters-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely not enough to substantially improve Black voter turnout</a> or Democrats’ prospects in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the hearings now over, we now wait for Jackson’s confirmation vote. Given that the Senate almost surely won’t vote within the next week, there’s still plenty of time for public opinion to change around Jackson, especially as clips from the hearings make the rounds on social media and television. At this point, though, Jackson still benefits from having the support of many Americans, and opposition to her nomination doesn’t seem to exceed typical partisan divides. With a Democratic-controlled Senate, that might be all that’s needed for her ascension to the nation’s highest court.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/generation-z-future-of-faith/">Generation Z is the least religious generation yet</a>, according to recently published data from the December 2021 American National Family Life Survey from the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life. Thirty-four percent of Generation Z (those between the ages of 18 and 24) reported being religiously unaffiliated, compared with just 9 percent of those in the Silent Generation (those between the ages of 76 and 93). The survey’s authors attribute Gen Z’s lack of religious affiliation to less religious participation during their formative years, finding that compared with older generations, Gen Z was less likely to have attended religious services or educational programs, or to have prayed with their family or read religious texts while growing up. A greater share of Gen-Z Americans also said they were never religious (15 percent, compared with 10 percent of 25- to 40-year-olds, 6 percent of 41- to 56-year-olds, 3 percent of 57- to 75-year-olds, and zero percent of 76- to 93-year-olds).</li><li>Americans largely plan to tune out the 94th Academy Awards, according to a March 4-7 poll from YouGov. Forty-nine percent said they <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/j1cseekwm7/tabs_Academy_Awards_20220304.pdf">were not interested at all in watching the Oscars</a>, while just 9 percent said they were very interested. That’s in line with a March 15-18 poll from Morning Consult/Politico, where <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/21123905/2203112_crosstabs_MC_ENTERTAINMENT_OSCARS_Adults_STACKED_v2_CC.pdf">67 percent of Americans said</a> they were probably or definitely not going to watch. Of the best-picture nominees, YouGov found that “Dune” had the highest share of Americans who said they’d watched it — 26 percent — followed by “West Side Story” (25 percent) and “Don’t Look Up” (24 percent). And Morning Consult/Politico found that 22 percent had watched some or all of “Don’t Look Up,” versus 20 percent for “Dune” and 16 percent for “West Side Story.” (For more on what Americans think about the movies, you can check out <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/who-is-americas-favorite-actor/">our latest “The United Stats of America” episode here</a>.)</li><li>What schools teach is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/">a hot-button issue in the U.S.</a>, and although <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2022-03/FOR%20THE%20WEBSITE%20with%20branding%20v2%20Selzer%20Co%20GCNP%202249%20Methodology%20Document%203-21-2022.pdf">71 percent of Americans</a> said in a March 15-20 poll from Grinnell College/Selzer &amp; Company that they trusted schools in their district to ensure library books are appropriate, only 49 percent said they trusted their local district when it came to teaching about racism. (Forty-three percent said they didn’t trust their district on teaching racism, compared with the 22 percent who said the same of their district and its library books.) Furthermore, when asked about what children were being taught in public schools, 64 percent said that schools were on the wrong track, while just 24 percent said schools were heading in the right direction.</li><li>In the wake of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-americans-may-or-may-not-blame-biden-for-higher-gas-prices/">high gas prices</a> brought on by inflation and sanctions on Russia, a majority of likely voters think the U.S. should now increase domestic production of oil and gas. According to a March 18-21 poll from Echelon Insights, a Republican firm, <a href="http://60p3co1nax34ovc830mr2sak-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/March-2022-Omnibus-EXTERNAL-TOPLINE.pdf">69 percent said that the U.S. should increase domestic production</a> in response to banning imports of Russian oil, and 62 percent said that increasing production domestically was the best way to deal with rising gas prices. When asked about specific policies, 42 percent supported approving the Keystone XL pipeline and 41 percent supported expanding oil drilling on federal lands.</li><li>A majority of American men have invested at least something in cryptocurrencies, according to a March 14-20 poll from The Harris Poll. To be sure, <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Data-Tables-Wave-108.pdf">49 percent of men surveyed said they’d invested nothing at all</a> in cryptocurrencies, versus 51 percent who’d invested at least some, but that stands in stark contrast with American women. Nearly three-quarters of women (72 percent) have zero crypto investments, while 28 percent have invested at least some.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings wrapped up on Thursday, and all indications point to Jackson being confirmed, largely along partisan lines. She would be the first Black woman and first public defender to serve on the court. Since her confirmation is expected, the hearings — similar to past ones — were more about politics. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Galen Druke and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux discuss the messages that senators sent and whether we were able to glean anything about what kind of justice Jackson would be. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When it comes to the presidential primary calendar, it can feel like if you’re not first (or, at least, not living in one of the four states that get to vote early on), you’re last. For a long time now, that has meant that if you don’t hail from Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, candidates and political media could care less what you think. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But for Democrats that might finally change. <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2008/1/2/20062199/other-states-are-sick-of-iowa-new-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concerns about</a> Iowa and New Hampshire’s <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/10/13/harry-reids-sorry-not-sorry-apology-for-disparaging-iowa-nh/73884784/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">representativeness</a> have only grown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/opinion/iowa-new-hampshire-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in recent years</a>. Not to mention that after Iowa’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/iowa-might-have-screwed-up-the-whole-nomination-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disastrous 2020 caucuses</a>, where myriad technical problems hampered the reporting of results, there have been <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/05/26/its-time-to-fix-democrats-iowa-and-new-hampshire-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed calls</a> for the Democratic Party to alter its calendar ahead of the 2024 presidential cycle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The latest push came earlier this month, when the <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2022/03/11/dnc-plan-end-iowa-caucuses-first-place-presidential-calendar-democrats/9433481002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Des Moines Register reported</a> that the Democratic National Committee was examining a draft proposal to determine which states would vote early. Under that proposal, states would seek a waiver to vote early based on multiple criteria, including a state’s “ability to run [a] fair, transparent and inclusive primary”; ethnic diversity; geographic diversity; union representation; and general election competitiveness. And although the DNC <a href="https://www.kwwl.com/news/national-democrats-continue-discussions-on-the-future-of-iowas-first-in-the-nation-caucus-status/article_33f1ac50-a3ec-11ec-8eb4-230d109c4a79.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t end up considering the proposal</a> at its March gathering, intraparty debate <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/22/iowa-democrats-nomination-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over the calendar will continue</a>, with the possibility that some set of these criteria will play a role in determining the voting order of states in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that in mind, we took a look at what the primary calendar might look like if the early-voting states were determined by these sorts of criteria. Of course, not every state would apply for a waiver, and we also can’t know for sure what data the DNC would use or, moreover, what secret sauce it would employ when deciding how to weigh various data points; nor does the DNC have full top-down control over the voting order of states. But! If we set all that aside, this might still be the direction in which the party moves, so here’s a look at which states would score well — or poorly — based on the fairness of their elections, their ethnic and racial diversity, their rate of union membership and their competitiveness in the 2020 presidential election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First up is a states’ ability to run fair, transparent and inclusive primaries. Following the contentious 2016 Democratic contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, when Iowa’s caucuses featured a razor-thin margin with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-05/iowa-democrats-say-recount-impossible-in-clinton-sanders-virtual-tie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no mechanism</a> for a recount and <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2016/02/03/editorial-something-smells-democratic-party/79777580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple caucus states</a> struggled to <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2016/03/02/record-caucus-crowds-catch-officials-off-guard-as-sanders-wins-colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handle large numbers of voters</a>, Democrats have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-will-democrats-move-away-from-caucuses-affect-the-2020-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embraced the use of primaries</a>, going from 14 caucuses in 2016 to two in 2020, and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/governor-signs-law-giving-nevada-1st-presidential-primary-78226292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely one</a> — or maybe even zero — in 2024.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Iowa and Nevada were the only 2020 caucus states" aria-label="Map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qXWei/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="680" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">State-run primaries score well on the DNC’s election-fairness metric because those primaries give voters the ultimate flexibility in casting their votes. Generally speaking, voters have hours to vote at their local precinct (or even more time if their state allows for early voting!) and can then go about their day. This is also somewhat true for states where the <a href="http://www.frontloadinghq.com/search/label/party-run%20primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state party runs the primary</a> instead of the state government — usually because the state has no presidential primary law — but we scored state-run primaries higher because the two types aren’t equivalent: In state-run contests, the state and local government manage things and voting is similar to casting a ballot in the general election, whereas a party-run event tends to have shorter hours and fewer voting locations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Caucuses, on the other hand, score the lowest because they are much more time intensive. In Iowa, for instance, Democratic voters must commit at least a couple of hours of their evening to the process, which typically involves hearing supporters talk up each candidate, casting a vote and then potentially shifting support if the voters’ candidate doesn’t have enough backing to be “viable.” Time and accessibility are big reasons why primaries <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/historic-turnout-in-2020-not-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually have higher turnout</a> than caucuses. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as you can see in the map above, there isn’t actually that much difference between the states on this metric. Only Iowa scores really poorly, and in 2024, Iowa may be the only state that uses a caucus — provided it doesn’t go for a party-run primary<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/04/republican-senators-defend-iowa-caucus-110665" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;It’s unlikely&lt;/a&gt; that Iowa’s Republican-controlled legislature will pass a presidential primary law, so if Iowa Democrats want a primary, they’ll have to run it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> — as Nevada passed a law last year that established it will <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/governor-signs-law-giving-nevada-1st-presidential-primary-78226292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use a presidential primary starting in 2024</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the DNC’s next metric — the racial and ethnic diversity of a state — there is more of a stark difference. Iowa once again scores poorly as one of the whitest states in the country, but so does New Hampshire. In fact, this lack of diversity in the first two states to vote is one of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/31/democrats-primary-schedule-2024-478680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the biggest criticisms</a> of the Democratic primary calendar, especially considering about 2 in 5 Democrats identify as people of color, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. We don’t know how the DNC would measure the diversity of a state — for instance, would they consider the overall diversity of the state or just the diversity among Democrats? — but one straightforward way to measure a state’s diversity is to use the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/racial-and-ethnic-diversity-in-the-united-states-2010-and-2020-census.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Census Bureau’s Diversity Index</a>, which calculates the likelihood that two people chosen at random in a state will be from different racial and ethnicity groups. Based on that measure, western states like Hawaii, California and Nevada score extremely well, as the table below shows.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nevada, of course, already votes early, having gone third in the Democratic primary <a href="http://www.frontloadinghq.com/2009/03/2008-presidential-primary-calendar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2008</a>,<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, Michigan voted third in 2008, but it &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/09/04/primary.calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;disobeyed party rules&lt;/a&gt; to do so and lost its delegates as a result (although it later got &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/us/politics/01rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;half of them back&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>8</sup></a> so between its recent switch to a primary and its sizable racial and ethnic diversity, it would score very well on these first two criteria. As for the other states that currently vote early, Iowa and New Hampshire score among the bottom six spots, while South Carolina finished right in the middle of the pack.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means the DNC might want to take note of the other places that score highly on this metric; Maryland, the District of Columbia, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Florida and Georgia round out the top 10, including the three western states we mentioned earlier. We know geographic diversity is something else the draft proposal prioritized, so if the DNC wanted to pick a Northeastern state instead of New Hampshire, the party might pay special attention to New Jersey. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">New Jersey Democrats <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/move-iowa-jersey-democrats-vie-early-presidential-primary/story?id=83505174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently made the case</a> to the DNC that the Garden State should go early, and the fact that New Jersey ranks eighth in the Census’s Diversity Index suggests it would help improve the relative diversity of the early states. Not to mention, New Jersey ranks second in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index</a>, and for a party largely built on a base of voters <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/in-2020-the-largest-metro-areas-made-the-difference-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living in large metropolitan areas</a>, it might also be a good fit under that metric.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Labor union membership was another criteria laid out in the draft resolution, and while participation in unions <a href="https://www.epi.org/unequalpower/publications/private-sector-unions-corporate-legal-erosion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has declined markedly over the past 50 years</a>, organized labor remains an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-ruling-wounds-both-democrats-and-unions-neither-fatally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influential part</a> of the Democratic coalition. It <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spends millions</a> on behalf of Democratic candidates, and Biden won 56 percent of voters in union households in 2020, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to national exit polls</a>. Here, too, Hawaii tops the list, although it just narrowly edges out New York as the state with the largest share of workers who belong to unions as of 2021, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t05.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Hawaii <a href="https://elections.hawaii.gov/elections-in-hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t have a presidential primary law</a> — Democrats there <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/23/politics/joe-biden-hawaii-democratic-primary-results/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used a party-run event</a> in 2020 — but the Aloha State is still an attractive early-state option (maybe most of all for campaign reporters) given how well it scores on both diversity and union membership. Union membership is also a point in favor of New York and New Jersey, which also both rank in the top 10 for diversity. Meanwhile, of the current early states, Nevada ranks 17th and New Hampshire 21st, while Iowa ranks 33rd and South Carolina finishes dead last when it comes to union participation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The last factor we’ll examine is how competitive a state was in the 2020 general election, using the popular vote margin between President Biden and then-President Donald Trump. On this metric, Georgia and Arizona top the list as both states were decided by less than a half percentage point in 2020, followed by Wisconsin, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/even-though-biden-won-republicans-enjoyed-the-largest-electoral-college-edge-in-70-years-will-that-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “tipping-point” state</a>, or the state that delivered the decisive 270th electoral vote Biden needed to win.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This is actually a metric where most of the current early states score fairly well, too: Nevada, New Hampshire and Iowa all rank in the top 13, while South Carolina comes in at 18th. It’s also a weak point for some of the other states that score well on diversity and union membership: Biden carried Hawaii, New Jersey and New York by at least 15 points in 2020, for instance, making them uncompetitive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So where does this leave us in the early-state debate? Well, if we take each of these four components, <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/mean-normalization-and-feature-scaling-a-simple-explanation-3b9be7bfd3e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standardize the data</a> for each state<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each metric, I took a state’s value or score — for example, the share of a state’s population in a union — and subtracted the average for that category, then divided that by the standard deviation of the data for all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Also, whether a state uses a primary or a caucus can’t be calculated in quite the same way, so I gave every state that used a primary in 2020 a value of 1 (including Nevada, which is now a primary state), every state that used a party-run primary a value of 0 and every state that used a caucus -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> and then sum the scores across all four measures, Nevada is perhaps the best early-state choice for Democrats, just narrowly edging out New York:</p>

 <footer><p>The scores represent the standardization of each output, except for primary access, where states with primaries were scored as 1, states with party-run primaries were scored as 0 and caucus states were scored as -1. Primary access is based on 2020 voting method and recent changes to state law where applicable.</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">New Jersey and Hawaii also make the top five, as does Washington, which already experienced a primary calendar change recently, moving its primary to early March in the 2020 Democratic contest. There isn’t a ton of good news in these scores for the other three early-voting states, however, as South Carolina and New Hampshire ranked in the low 30s, while Iowa comes in at 47th.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We mentioned this earlier, but there is one other important consideration here that was not possible to score: geographic diversity among the early-voting states. And that’s something Democrats (and Republicans) already have with the current lineup. Each of the first four states comes from one of the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four census regions</a>: Nevada from the West, Iowa from the Midwest, South Carolina from the South and New Hampshire from the Northeast. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevada seems well-positioned to hold onto its position as the key Western state under these metrics, but maybe New York or New Jersey fight to replace New Hampshire from the Northeast. Lower down the list, Michigan as the Midwestern state with the highest score looks to supplant Iowa, and Georgia edges out South Carolina as the Southern state that scores highest.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we are <em>not</em> suggesting that Nevada, New York, Michigan and Georgia are about to top the 2024 Democratic primary calendar. Rather, this exercise gives us a better idea of how the different priorities laid out in the draft resolution might shake up the primary calendar. In the end, though, it’s unlikely that the DNC will take such a cut-and-dry approach. For instance, South Carolina doesn’t score all that well (32nd overall), but part of its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-joe-biden-be-in-trouble-in-south-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeal as an early state</a> for Democrats is that it has a <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/census_2000/cb01cn176.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable Black population</a>, which is an important part of the Democratic base. And while Georgia also has a larger number of Black voters, one advantage to South Carolina is it’s not as populous, so it’s cheaper to advertise in — something that is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40270928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally true</a> of most media markets in the current early states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, say that the DNC does try to change things, states in danger of losing their primo spots on the calendar can push back. Different state laws could make it challenging to supplant Iowa and New Hampshire, too. <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/43.4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa law dictates</a>, for instance, that the state’s caucuses shall be held “at least eight days earlier” than any other presidential contest, while New Hampshire’s law <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/02/05/why-is-new-hampshire-the-first-primary-in-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gives discretion</a> to its secretary of state to move the date to preserve the Granite State’s status as the “first in the nation” primary. In fact, every state government and/or state party sets the date of its contest, so while the DNC can try to influence those choices, they ultimately have only so much power to set the calendar. Not to mention the GOP <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/07/republican-panel-no-changes-iowa-caucuses-2024-election-president/6695300001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t plan to make any changes</a> to its early primary calendar, which could make it even more complicated to supplant states like Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, while it’s clear Iowa and New Hampshire have plenty of reason to worry, don’t necessarily bet against them kicking off the cycle again in 2024.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">According to a <a href="https://blueprintpolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BPP-Georgia.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent survey</a> from Blueprint Polling, Republican Herschel Walker is leading Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock 49 percent to 45 percent in Georgia’s 2022 Senate race. According to <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/texas-2022-beto-and-abbott-matchup-likely-in-governor-s-race-ag-paxton-tries-to-avoid-runoff-in-republican-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another</a> from Emerson College/The Hill/Nexstar, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, leads Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke 52 percent to 45 percent. And according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/john-zogby-strategies-emi-research-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yet another</a> from John Zogby Strategies/EMI Research Solutions/Unite NY, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, has 14-to-19-point leads over an array of possible Republican opponents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are surely good signs for Walker, Abbott and Hochul … or are they?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These polls, like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the others</a> you’ve seen of the 2022 general election so far, were conducted seven months or more before the general election. This means that there is still plenty of time for the trajectory of a race to change — whether due to news events, campaign strategy or shifts in the national environment. But while these polls are still from very early in the election cycle, they’re already pretty useful at this stage — you just have to bear in mind that, like all polls, they come with a margin of error.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s according to our analysis of general election polls for Senate and governor conducted in the first six months of every election year going back to 1998. Using over 2,000 polls, we built polling averages for 261 Senate races and 225 gubernatorial contests that had at least one survey in the first six months, finding that these polls have a fairly strong relationship to the final results in November, as the chart below shows.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_multivariable/bs704_multivariable5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;correlation between&lt;/a&gt; the Senate polling averages and results was .897, while the correlation between the gubernatorial polling averages and results was .839.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>10</sup></a></p>

Gubernatorial polls conducted during this span had a similar weighted average error of 8.6 points. That’s not super precise, but it’s also not much worse than polls conducted in the final three weeks of the 1998-2020 campaigns, which had a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted average error of 5.4 points</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Early polls have also tended to “call” races correctly more often than not this far out, though that’s a bit of a quick-and-dirty way to understand polling accuracy. In a weighted average, early Senate polls have identified the eventual winner 76 percent of the time, while early gubernatorial polls have been right 78 percent of the time. This is only marginally worse than polls conducted in the last three weeks of the campaign, which averaged out to 81 percent for the Senate and 83 percent for governor races from 1998 to 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a catch with the topline numbers for early surveys: Polls that show close races for Senate or governor — those with margins between 0 and 5 points — are essentially coin flips when it comes to being correct in November, as the table shows. The likelihood that polls nailed the eventual winner in races where the candidate has a 5-to-10 point edge or a double-digit lead is much higher, though, at roughly 75 percent and 90 percent of the time, respectively.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">One more point in early polls’ favor: We found that they did not consistently overestimate either party — i.e., their weighted average bias was not disproportionately skewed toward Democrats or Republicans. Overall, early Senate polls conducted in the first six months of all races from 1998 to 2021 had only a 0.1-point weighted average bias toward Republicans, while early gubernatorial surveys had just a 0.02-point lean toward the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This doesn’t mean that some <em>individual</em> cycles didn’t have significant biases — only that early polls in those cycles weren’t any more biased than polls later in those cycles. (If you’re a regular FiveThirtyEight reader, you’re probably already familiar with the fact that the late polls overestimated Democrats in both 2016 and 2020; well, it turns out the early polls did, too.) </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But good luck guessing the direction of the bias of early 2022 polls. True, in the last four cycles, early Senate polls have been about 3 to 6 points too good for Democrats. But in three of the four cycles before that, early Senate polls had overestimated Republicans — and early gubernatorial polls overestimated Republicans in 2018, too. Moreover, as the 2018 cycle showed, one set of polls could be skewed toward one party, while surveys for another office could end up biased toward the other party. Though the 2022 electoral environment <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is shaping up</a> to be <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advantageous for the GOP</a>, just how accurately the polls gauge races remains to be seen. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to the 2022 election, though, there are still some takeaways for us based on our analysis of early polls in previous cycles. For instance, there’s not much we can say about Georgia’s Senate race, as Walker leads Warnock by about 2 points, on average; we found in previous cycles that when a candidate led by 0 to 5 points, the accuracy of polls was essentially a coin flip. We likely have a better sense of the ultimate outcome in Texas’s governor’s race, though, as Abbott currently leads O’Rourke by about 6 points, on average, which has historically given candidates a 3-in-4 shot at winning. Finally, in New York’s gubernatorial contest, we don’t know for sure whom each party will nominate, but assuming the apparent frontrunners do meet in November — Hochul and GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin — the early polls definitely point toward a Hochul victory, as she leads Zeldin by about 13 points, which is the sort of advantage that historically has signaled a candidate has a 9-in-10 chance of victory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So can you trust the polls this far out? Sure you can, but be careful about how you interpret them. Polls are not a precise measurement of where a race will end up, even in the final days of an election. That said, they’re pretty telling, even many months before the general election.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It was a promise Joe Biden made during a low point in his presidential campaign, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-suffers-huge-2020-loss-in-new-hampshire-primary-2020-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after he lost both</a> the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary. Just <a href="https://apnews.com/article/stephen-breyer-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-campaign-2016-south-carolina-3a36206929862d7c06293a5724eff2fd" data-type="URL" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/stephen-breyer-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-campaign-2016-south-carolina-3a36206929862d7c06293a5724eff2fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">days before the South Carolina primary</a>, when Black voters would <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/1/21160030/biden-black-vote-south-carolina-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectively hand him</a> the Democratic nomination, Biden said at the end of a debate that if he were elected, he would nominate the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a promise that some Republicans have since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/20/ted-cruz-biden-promise-black-woman-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">derided as discriminatory</a> or <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/gop-sen-wicker-compares-biden-s-supreme-court-pledge-affirmative-n1288211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">akin to affirmative action</a>, but the president’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson</a> to fill the seat of retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, is the one notable promise to Black voters — perhaps the only one — that Biden has managed to uphold. And according to political science research and experts I spoke to, this promise of appointing the nation’s first Black woman to the Supreme Court <em>is</em> important to Black voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In February, political scientists <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/jaclyn-kaslovsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaclyn Kaslovsky</a> of Rice University and <a href="https://www.andrewrstone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew R. Stone</a> of Washington University in St. Louis published a piece in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/15/biden-supreme-court-nominee-black/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a> about their research showing that Black Americans place a high value on what’s called “descriptive representation.” In other words, having someone who looks like them in a position of power — particularly in the judiciary — is very important to Black Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kaslovsky told me one reason why Black Americans may want more Black people in positions of power is that they’ve been historically underrepresented in politics. “There’s research arguing that group consciousness matters for how people evaluate political institutions,” she said. “So, as Black Americans become more represented in the judiciary, they may feel like their voices are legitimated by that institution.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jackson’s confirmation process comes at an important time, too, as Black Americans have soured on Biden in the past six months, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of presidential approval polls going back to October. But while it’s possible that Jackson’s nomination offers the president a lifeline with Black voters, who overwhelmingly want to see her confirmed, there are also many reasons why Biden’s nomination of Jackson won’t be enough. Although research shows that a diverse judiciary is important to some Black voters, it’s unlikely that Jackson’s nomination will erase <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-failure-to-pass-a-voting-rights-bill-fits-a-pattern-of-failing-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s longstanding problem</a> of failing to address and implement policies that would benefit <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/03/07/african-americans-are-the-democrats-most-loyal-constituency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ most loyal base</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Biden dropped the ball on so many things, and not just things that people hoped for or expected he’d do, but promises he made to the American public, like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062070001/student-loan-forgiveness-debt-president-biden-campaign-promise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restructuring student loan debt</a> or <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/11/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-all-americans-to-be-eligible-for-vaccinations-by-may-1-puts-the-nation-on-a-path-to-get-closer-to-normal-by-july-4th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managing the pandemic better</a> or <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/biden-promise-tracker/promise/1583/offer-8000-tax-credit-child-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implementing the child tax credit</a>,” said <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/sociology/faculty/rlr3462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert L. Reece</a>, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin. “I’d bet that type of stuff starts to become more and more prominent as the election becomes closer, especially given that Jackson’s nomination has less of an immediate impact on people’s lives.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s working in Biden’s favor is that polls suggest that Black voters <em>really </em>want<em> </em>Jackson to make it through the nomination process and that her appointment is motivating them ahead of what’s expected to be a grueling midterm cycle for Democrats. While surveys on midterm enthusiasm among Black Americans are generally sparse, at least one survey from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/09/black-voters-midterms-ketanji-brown-jackson-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> shows that Black voters became more enthusiastic for the midterm elections in late February — right around the time Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/kbj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made Jackson’s nomination public</a>. Other polls similarly show Black Americans’ eagerness to get Jackson through the nomination process. According to <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-support-judge-kentanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-to-the-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navigator Research</a>, 89 percent of Democratic voters and 88 percent of Black voters said they trusted Biden’s judgment on who should be the next Supreme Court justice. In fact, among all races and ethnic groups, Black voters were the most likely to say they would support the Senate’s confirmation of Jackson, at 71 percent; only 11 percent of Black voters said they would oppose the confirmation, for a net support of 60 percentage points. Asian American and Pacific Islander voters had the second-highest level of support for Jackson’s confirmation: 58 percent would support her confirmation, for a net support of 51 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But enthusiasm for Biden’s Supreme Court pick hasn’t translated to support for Biden himself so far. In fact, disillusionment with his administration has increased in the past six months. </p>

Still, Biden’s approval is down overall, and the dwindling support among Black Americans is particularly notable given that this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/08/black-voters-helped-biden-get-elected-his-presidency-will-be-defined-by-how-he-acts-racial-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bloc helped clinch</a> the presidency for Biden in 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, not only are Biden’s struggles with Black voters now part of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-year-in-bidens-approval-rating-is-in-troubleonly-trumps-was-lower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger trend</a> in his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abysmal approval ratings</a>, but, according to Reece, other frustrations are likely playing a role, too — for instance, a lack of movement on critical policy concerns like <a href="https://time.com/6051071/george-floyd-biden-police-reform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police reform</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/01/1023393344/black-leaders-question-whether-biden-will-fulfill-campaign-promises-to-black-vot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting rights legislation</a>, COVID-19 rates and inflation, which still <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-is-taking-biggest-toll-on-nonwhite-voters-wsj-poll-shows-11647255601?mod=hp_lead_pos12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately affect</a> Black Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the short term at least, it’s possible that Jackson’s confirmation — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-racism-and-sexism-could-define-ketanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assuming it goes through smoothly</a> — will galvanize some Black voters. But, Reece warned me, if this is the <em>only </em>thing the Biden administration is banking on to court the Black vote, it’s probably not going to be enough. “People need tangible things. Not just symbolic representation to get out and vote, especially in the midterms,” he said. “Not only do <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/24/voter-turnout-always-drops-off-for-midterm-elections-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less people typically vote</a>, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-republicans-really-have-a-big-turnout-advantage-in-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans tend to vote</a> in higher shares.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, while the historic nature of Jackson’s nomination shouldn’t be dismissed, the Biden administration should not discount the fact that appointments and platitudes alone may not be enough to persuade Black voters to turn out in droves this year the same way <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/large-racial-turnout-gap-persisted-2020-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they did in 2020</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have long struggled with engaging Black voters, though, and this is a symptom of a larger problem, as former FiveThirtyEight senior writer Farai Chideya <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained ahead of the 2016 presidential election</a>. Because Black Americans reliably vote Democratic, they are treated somewhat as a “captured” voting bloc: That is, they’re often ignored by Republicans but taken for granted by Democrats. As a consequence, Democrats in power, including Biden and current members of Congress, tend to not address or prioritize many of the policy concerns Black communities have.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Jackson’s nomination is pretty far away from the midterms, and there’s still plenty of time for voters to either forget Biden took this step or<em> </em>warm up to him before November. As the Morning Consult/Politico poll shows, along with tracking polls from <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/president-biden-job-approval-rating?crossBreak=black" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a>, Biden’s standing among Black Americans has the potential to rebound. But, as Reece told me, “Biden will have to rely on something else to motivate Black people come November. I’m not sure if Jackson’s nomination will be the thing that gets people out of their seats for a midterm election.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Nov. 4, 2008, Barack Obama, then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a senator from Illinois</a>, was elected the first Black president of the United States. His election was seen as a hopeful moment in America and <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/human_rights_vol36_2009/fall2009/on_celebrating_an_election_as_racial_progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ushered</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05elect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots</a> of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2008/12/30/end-of-racism-oped-cx_jm_1230mcwhorter.html?sh=267378f349f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think pieces</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-oe-steele5-2008nov05-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> that his presidency was the start of a new “post-racial” society. At long last — in the eyes of many, at least — there was hope that the racial wounds that have long divided Black and white Americans would heal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That, of course, never happened. Even at the time, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/08/racism-is-the-only-reason-obama-might-lose.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain white voters</a> refused to vote for Obama because of his race, and a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-hatecrimes/election-of-obama-provokes-rise-in-u-s-hate-crimes-idUSTRE4AN81U20081124" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rise in hate crimes</a> followed his win. Moreover, in the lead up to Obama’s first election, some <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1065a4RaceandPolitics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls showed that</a> only about one-third of white Americans (38 percent) thought Obama would help race relations, compared with 60 percent of Black Americans. Moreover, a plurality of white Americans thought (or, perhaps, hoped) that his candidacy would have no impact on race relations, essentially upholding the status quo. What’s more, some white voters during this period <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/rise-white-identity-politics-didn-t-start-trump-explains-michael-ncna926191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started to become resentful</a> of a Black man ascending to the highest political office. And <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-racial-stereotypes-impacted-voting-for-obama-and-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that backlash</a>, in part, spurred the election of former President Donald Trump eight years later. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s election killed any illusions anyone might have had about a “post-racial” America. Indeed, Trump was successful in finding a predominately white audience who lapped up his overt racism toward people of color and who were eager to embrace a rising sense of <a href="https://theconversation.com/trump-tapped-into-white-victimhood-leaving-fertile-ground-for-white-supremacists-150587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white victimhood</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump may be out of power, but those feelings aren’t. They may even be growing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With President Biden having just passed one full year in office, public opinion research shows that white Americans — and especially Republicans — see whites as victims of discrimination more than, say, Hispanic or Black Americans. According to a 2021 survey by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/18/majorities-of-americans-see-at-least-some-discrimination-against-black-hispanic-and-asian-people-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, for example, only 17 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning Americans said there is “a lot” of discrimination against Black people in today’s society. That number rose to 26 percent when Republicans were asked whether they believed <em>white</em> people faced “a lot” of discrimination. And intense <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-backlash-is-a-type-of-racial-reckoning-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white racial resentment</a> remains present both among Trump’s base and in our politics today. Case in point: Trump, who’s a (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-majority-of-republican-voters-actively-want-trump-to-run-for-president-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very, very early</a>) favorite to win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, is still hitting that same drum; during a recent political event, the former president went so far as to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-rally-trump-claims-covid-19-treatment-is-anti-white-people-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falsely claim</a> that white people were currently being discriminated against and sent to the “back of the line” when it came to receiving COVID-19 vaccines and treatment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump is not the first white person to feel like a victim of discrimination or to make claims in that spirit. This phenomenon started long before him. But in the U.S., if we look at things like the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-many-americans-dont-see-the-racial-wealth-gap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial wealth gap</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-wells-fargo-black-home-loan-refinancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage denial rates</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fewer-black-americans-are-getting-the-covid-19-vaccine-no-its-not-hesitancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 vaccination and illness rates</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-black-women-are-often-missing-from-conversations-about-police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police violence rates</a> or myriad other data sets, we quickly see plenty of systemic biases against Black Americans and other minority groups (such as increasing <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-339-percent-nationwide-last-year-repo-rcna14282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hate crimes against Asian Americans</a>). You can’t, however, find such widespread evidence for anti-white discrimination. So why have many white Americans started to see themselves<em> </em>as the victims of racial discrimination?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back in 2011, Harvard Business School professor <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=326229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Norton</a> and Tufts University professor <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/psychology/people/faculty/samuel-sommers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samuel Sommers</a> published <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691611406922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study</a> showing that white Americans perceived bias against whites as increasing from the 1950s to the 2000s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Sommers, it’s hard to pinpoint just <em>one </em>factor driving this feeling of white victimhood among white Americans. “There’s this sense that there’s only so much of anything to go around, so more of something for other groups or entities might mean less of something for me and my group,” he told us. “That makes a lot of sense when you’re talking about food at the table in front of you, but it feels like it’s getting applied to things like equal rights — or respect and status.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These feelings <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/08/racism-is-the-only-reason-obama-might-lose.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were especially prevalent in the late 2000s</a>, when white people saw a Black man rising to the nation’s highest office. But today, beyond Obama, other perceived “threats” to white Americans — such as an increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiracial nation</a> that could eventually lead to the U.S. becoming <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/26/14340542/white-fear-trump-psychology-minority-majority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a “majority-minority” society</a>, or<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/26/14340542/white-fear-trump-psychology-minority-majority" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> <a href="https://theconversation.com/trump-tapped-into-white-victimhood-leaving-fertile-ground-for-white-supremacists-150587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s loss in 2020 to Biden</a> — likely fueled existing beliefs and feelings of inadequacy and victimhood among white Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The same is likely true of the discussions about “racial reckonings” following the murder of George Floyd, coupled with a few high-profile examples of Black people breaking barriers. Indeed, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous polling</a> has documented that white Americans — and especially white Republicans — largely think too much attention is paid to race and racial issues. And, as we wrote about in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-helped-build-the-social-safety-net-why-are-many-now-against-expanding-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our last article</a>, there are additional concerns about racial minorities getting more than they deserve. Kamala Harris’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kamala-harris-biden-vice-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ascendance to the vice presidency</a> as well as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson</a> to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, for example, likely further stoked white Americans’ existing hatred against Black people and other marginalized groups. To use the language of Ohio State University professor <a href="https://english.osu.edu/people/mitchell.717" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koritha Mitchell</a>, “Black success beckons the mob.” There is a phenomenon Mitchell calls “<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/715439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know-your-place aggression</a>” whereby U.S. culture celebrates the success of straight white men (regardless of their merit) but discourages, diminishes or destroys the achievements of members of other groups. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This phenomenon is related to one of the other things Sommers told us about:<strong> </strong>jockeying for stigma. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Maybe that’s a more general human phenomenon that transcends race and racism,” Sommers said, “but now we’re talking about it on a much more serious and problematic level.” When white Americans see minorities succeed, it threatens them in a way that makes them feel like victims. As Sommers puts it: “It seems like there’s some kind of status, attention or special treatment that certain white people think will be bestowed on them if they make the claim that they’ve been treated unfairly.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, for a “post-racial” America to exist, white people would need to see people of color ascending to higher political offices and an increasingly multiracial nation as a win for <em>all </em>of America. Instead, many take these things as a personal attack and view it as a loss of their <em>own</em> status at the top of America’s racial hierarchy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We see evidence for this in public opinion data, too. With the help of Kathleen Weldon and Jacob Harris of the <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roper Center for Public Opinion Research</a> — a research center that has one of the largest archives of public opinion datasets (and where one of us, Neil Lewis Jr., is a faculty affiliate) — and Natalie Jackson from the <a href="https://www.prri.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Religion Research Institute</a> (PRRI), we looked at perceptions of discrimination against white Americans over time, and how those perceptions vary by both partisanship and race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since at least the year 2000, polling firms have been asking Americans questions about how much discrimination they perceive is faced by white Americans, asking respondents to place that discrimination on a scale or to compare it to other racial and ethnic groups. And our analysis of the Roper Center’s data shows that before Obama’s first election, roughly half of Republicans perceived there to be at least some discrimination against white people. Specifically, according to a 2000 poll from Princeton Survey Research Associates/The National Conference for Community and Justice, 56 percent of Republicans said that white Americans faced at least some discrimination, and by 2005, when the organizations asked the question again, that number dipped slightly to 47 percent. However, toward the end of Obama’s first term, other polling found the share of Republicans answering a similar question to be higher, as can be seen for the years 2011 and 2012 on the chart below, which uses data from PRRI.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">PRRI has asked a slightly different question — to what extent respondents agree that discrimination against white Americans is now as significant of an issue as discrimination against Black Americans and other minorities — almost yearly between 2011 and 2020. The trend across that timespan is a bit messier, but the share of Republicans who “completely agreed” or “mostly agreed” with the statement was mostly higher during Trump’s time in office than during Obama’s. </p>

The percentage of Democrats who say there is at least “some” discrimination against whites has steadily decreased since the turn of the century, and this trend is consistent across both Roper and PRRI datasets. These trends are also consistent with new research that builds on Norton and Sommers’s initial work. In a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/e6dar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forthcoming paper</a> in the journal <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perspectives on Psychological Science</a><em>, </em>a team of researchers from Tufts, Harvard and the VA Bedford Healthcare System found that race and partisanship shape perceptions of racism as a zero-sum game. “Liberal White Americans saw racism as a zero-sum game they were winning by a lot, moderate White Americans saw it as a game they were winning by only a little,” the researchers wrote, “and conservative White Americans saw it as a game they were losing.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, race and partisanship are intertwined: The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast majority of Republicans are white</a>, and indeed, if we look at the same question by race, we see similar patterns:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="864" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-race-hires.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-race-hires.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-race-hires.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-race-hires.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="621" height="1089" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-2-mobile@2x.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-2-mobile@2x.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-2-mobile@2x.png?w=621 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-2-mobile@2x.png?w=1242 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Worryingly, these trends may be <em>increasing </em>after Biden’s inauguration. PRRI didn’t ask the same question again in 2021, so we can’t make an apples-to-apples comparison there. But according to Pew’s 2021 survey, the share of Republicans — including “leaners,” i.e., Americans leaning toward one party or the other — who said there is at least “some” discrimination against white people was 63 percent. This includes 26 percent who said there is “a lot” of discrimination against white people, which <em>looks</em> like an all-time high. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We say “looks” because the polling data we have is messy. If we compare the Pew data to past Pew data (so that the methodology and question wording is consistent), we see an increase from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/01/democrats-far-more-likely-than-republicans-to-see-discrimination-against-blacks-not-whites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a> (16 percent) to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/18/majorities-of-americans-see-at-least-some-discrimination-against-black-hispanic-and-asian-people-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021</a> (26 percent) for the share of Republicans saying white Americans face “a lot” of discrimination. Those are only two data points, of course. We’ll need more polling to know how to interpret that result for sure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, other recent polls have yielded similar findings with different questions. <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/project-home-fire-center-for-politics-research-reveals-outsized-role-immigration-plays-in-fueling-our-national-divide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a>, using a summer 2021 poll conducted by Project Home Fire and InnovateMR, found that only 38 percent of Trump voters either somewhat or strongly agreed that white people have advantages over people of color (compared with 87 percent of Biden voters). Moreover, 84 percent of Trump voters expressed concern that bigotry against white people will surge in the coming years. Meanwhile, only 38 percent of Biden voters felt the same way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s striking is how these perceptions persist even in the face of extraordinary evidence to the contrary. We have already discussed some domestic evidence about the persistence of racial discrimination against minority groups. Additionally, on the international stage, we see anti-Black racism manifesting even during a war: Journalists <a href="https://twitter.com/Sifill_LDF/status/1498512483690102784?s=20&amp;t=MeCWB6dPrSMtQuc56eZcpA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitoring the invasion in Ukraine</a> have reported that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/open-door-die-africans-report-racism-hostility-trying-flee-ukraine-rcna17953" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black people are being violently removed</a> from <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/african-students-racism-ukraine-invasion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trains trying to get people to safety</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What could be fueling an increase in these views? Following Trump’s loss in 2020, the Republican Party leaned further into messages that paint Republicans and white people as victims of an overzealous movement for racial justice. For example, Fox News coverage of critical race theory — a decades-old framework for legal scholarship — surged during the Virginia gubernatorial campaign, according to a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-critical-race-theory-glenn-youngkin-1650208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsweek analysis</a>, only to quickly and starkly dip following Republican Glenn Youngkin’s win. And several pundits pointed to education and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/opinion/crt-backlash-du-bois.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a> as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-virginias-electorate-shifted-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasons for his success</a>. Republicans have also<em> </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-attacking-cancel-culture-and-woke-people-is-becoming-the-gops-new-political-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a seemingly successful political strategy</a> in attacking and amplifying race-related buzzwords, such as “woke,” once used in activist circles. And as FiveThirtyEight contributors Hakeem Jefferson and Victor Ray pointed out on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, the current narratives of victimization and the associated backlash to racial progress are some white people’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-backlash-is-a-type-of-racial-reckoning-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way of reckoning</a> with the changing times. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sommers underscored the gravity of leadership’s role in these processes when we talked with him: “If we’ve learned nothing else in the last five or so years, it’s just how influential top-down attitudes are. When leaders around the country and at a regional level are using racist or vulgar language themselves, that seems to move the needle on what’s considered normative and acceptable behavior in our society.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If we want to address the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-reminded-us-of-just-how-unequal-america-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inequities that continue to plague and divide our society</a>, white Americans — and in particular, white Republicans — will need to move away from the victimhood narrative and acknowledge our current reality. And the extent that the inequities can be muted or even mitigated depends heavily on what politicians choose to emphasize in the narratives that they construct about the state of our union. The success of minorities does not mean victimization for white Americans. Without recognition that we can all succeed — and that the nation will be better off for it — the patterns of disparities we have discussed throughout will continue to persist, and we will all be worse off for it.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Here we go again. For the fourth time in five years, the strange rituals of the Supreme Court confirmation process have overtaken the Capitol. In the weeks since U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/kbj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was formally named</a> as President Joe Biden’s nominee to fill a soon-to-be-vacant spot on the high court, she has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/02/ketanji-brown-jackson-senators-confirmation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paying courtesy visits</a> to the senators who will vote on her confirmation. Now she’s made it through the gauntlet of private chitchat and is heading into an onslaught of public questions, none of which anyone really expects her to answer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Supreme Court confirmation hearings have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kavanaugh-was-quietly-conservative-on-day-2-of-his-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a predictable rhythm</a>, and this one doesn’t look like it will be an exception. Jackson will face a several-day barrage of broad and complex questions about her background, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-were-willing-to-break-the-rules-on-kavanaugh-day-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her philosophy as a judge</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-battle-lines-are-set-after-the-first-day-of-the-amy-coney-barrett-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her stance on hot-button issues</a>. Democrats will grandstand and lob her softballs. Republicans will grandstand and try to paint her as a radical. Jackson will smile and offer a series of polite nonanswers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These hearings feel like they should be consequential — after all, Jackson is up for a lifetime seat on the country’s most powerful court. But the process of confirming a Supreme Court justice has mostly become just another partisan performance. Barring a last-minute surprise, the outcome is already sealed, and everyone knows it. Democrats have the votes, so Jackson is almost certain to be confirmed within a matter of weeks. Her presence on the court — while historic — won’t do anything to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change its conservative tilt</a>. The main question is whether a Republican or two, sensing a low-cost opportunity to make a gesture toward bipartisan harmony, will cross the aisle to vote for her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As I said, strange rituals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The task of confirming would-be justices wasn’t always so drawn out, or so political. Early in the nation’s history, it might only take a couple of days for a Supreme Court nominee to be confirmed once they were named by the president. As the Supreme Court has grown more powerful and high-profile, the process has gotten longer and talkier. Since the mid-20th century, when the high court began to wade deeper into contentious battles over civil rights, the length of time between a justice being nominated and confirmed <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/07/up-until-the-postwar-era-u-s-supreme-court-confirmations-usually-were-routine-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has grown dramatically</a>, in large part because of the addition of public hearings. Jackson’s confirmation process may end up looking short compared to other modern justices, but that’s only because it’s taken months for many recent justices to be confirmed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Senators have also grown more eager to publicly weigh in on nominees’ qualifications. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-confirmation-hearings-have-more-questions-and-fewer-answers-than-ever-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis from 2018</a>, the number of issues that were covered during the hearings has increased in recent years too, with a special focus on topics that have gotten more politically important, like civil rights and judicial philosophy. But that doesn’t mean nominees are sharing more about their actual views on the issues voters care about — in fact, when they’re asked about issues that could come before the Supreme Court in the future, they <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/2020/10/why-do-supreme-court-nominees-avoid-answering-so-many-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely refuse to say anything</a>. “He has responded to many questions over the course of these hearings but he has adequately answered far too few of them,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/weekinreview/alito-vs-roberts-word-by-word.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Patrick Leahy complained</a> after three days of back-and-forth with now-Justice Samuel Alito.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/14/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-confirmation-00016594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans have promised</a> Jackson a “respectful” back-and-forth. Whether that actually happens, of course, remains to be seen. It might not seem worthwhile to turn these hearings into a partisan bloodbath — after all, Jackson’s nomination won’t shift the ideological balance of the court, which will retain a 6-3 conservative majority. But <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-racism-and-sexism-could-define-ketanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I wrote earlier this month</a>, it’s possible that racist or sexist lines of questioning could filter into the hearings in subtle or explicit ways, and raise the temperature of the interrogations. Jackson is pretty popular overall, which makes this strategy risky — <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/08161506/2203034_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/WSJPOLL032022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-support-judge-kentanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-to-the-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> have found that about half of Americans want the Senate to confirm her to the Supreme Court, and only around 30 percent are opposed to her confirmation. (The rest said they didn’t know.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are certain aspects of Jackson’s background that the senators seem likely to linger on. Her supporters will highlight the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/politics/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic nature of her nomination</a>, as the first Black woman and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/15/ketanji-brown-jackson-would-first-federal-defender-supreme-court/9424483002/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public defender</a> to be tapped for the Supreme Court. They’ll also emphasize her impeccable qualifications. On the other hand, her detractors are likely to seize on her career as a public defender as evidence that her ideology is too extreme, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-criminal-defense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly on issues like crime</a>. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley previewed a potential line of attack in a Twitter thread last week where <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1504221927665250305?s=20&amp;t=tXLuj3W9RcrHOhdCJGAi7Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he claimed</a> that Jackson had a “pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook.” The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-criminal-defense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized her work</a> representing detainees at Guantánamo Bay.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And depending on their mood, other Republican senators may argue that she has the wrong qualifications for the job — in the past few weeks, conservatives have implied both that she’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/tucker-carlson-ketanji-brown-jackson-lsat-scores-credentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not qualified</a> and that she’s <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1497218325394374709?s=20&amp;t=ClLfsxf5qWp63pX_i52eaQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too qualified</a>. Alternatively, opponents may hone in on the cases where her decisions as a trial court judge were reversed by higher courts. That line of attack might not be very fruitful, though; According to an analysis of Jackson’s record as a trial court judge by law professors Josh Fischman and Kevin Cope, her reversal rate is low, like most of the other judges in the District of D.C. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These hearings, then, are really about politics, not Jackson herself. We already have a pretty good idea of where Jackson would land, and Republicans are unlikely to ferret out anything new. Over the years, as control of the Supreme Court has become an increasingly high-stakes political issue, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/bidens-supreme-court-pick-thrills-progressives-looking-win-rcna17429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocacy groups</a> have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/us/politics/severinos-amy-coney-barrett.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed presidents</a> to nominate justices who are <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/09/david-souter-the-supreme-court-justice-who-built-the-trump-court-218953/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideologically predictable</a>. Jackson is no exception. It’s true that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on the empirical metrics we have</a>, it’s not clear exactly where she’d fall on the court’s left wing, but she would almost certainly be a reliable liberal vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For that reason, Jackson will be lucky to get even a sliver of bipartisan support. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-harder-than-ever-to-confirm-a-supreme-court-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As my colleague Geoffrey Skelley wrote in February</a>, successful Supreme Court nominees used to get the overwhelming support of senators in both parties, but those days have been over for a while. All of Trump’s nominees were confirmed with very narrow margins. Jackson <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/595822-the-three-republicans-who-voted-to-confirm-brown-jackson-for-appeals-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did get three Republican votes</a> when she was nominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year — but there’s no guarantee those senators will remain on her side now that a Supreme Court seat is up for grabs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But unless a moderate Democrat unexpectedly defects, which seems unlikely right now, Jackson’s path to the Supreme Court looks smooth. Occasionally, big and important issues do come up that pose a real threat to the nominee’s confirmation — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/27/652309743/christine-blasey-ford-describes-alleged-sexual-assault-by-kavanaugh-before-senat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the allegations that Justice Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape a woman in high school</a> are a notable recent example. For the most part, though, Supreme Court confirmation hearings have become very similar to other televised congressional spectacles — an opportunity for senators to advertise their own ideological sentiments in viral soundbites. This time, the fact that control of the court isn’t at stake isn’t likely to stop senators from seizing the spotlight, and it certainly won’t speed the hearings along. At worst, that could mean the next few days descend into ugly race-baiting rhetoric — and at best, it could make the process feel pretty empty.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Congress can’t agree on much lately — except, apparently, their hatred of changing the clocks twice a year. On Tuesday, just after Americans set their clocks an hour forward over the weekend, the Senate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/us/politics/daylight-saving-time-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously passed a bill</a> that would make daylight saving time permanent (although they still have to send it to the House for consideration). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Supporters of the bill presented it as a gift for a groggy country struggling to get its sleep back on track. And it’s true that the annual clock-changing ritual is not especially popular. A <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_031522/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University poll</a> conducted March 10-14 found that only 35 percent of Americans wanted to keep resetting their clocks every fall and spring, while a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/03/16/1742a/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov poll</a> conducted March 16 found that 59 percent of Americans wanted to see daylight saving time made permanent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, putting the whole country on daylight saving time year-round seems like a no-brainer. But we’ve been there before, and it’s still unclear whether Americans would actually like permanent daylight saving time if they got it. Because while longer afternoons and a consistent schedule are appealing, there’s a tradeoff — dark winter mornings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the past four years, support for making daylight saving time permanent has really gained steam, and not just in Congress. According to the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/daylight-savings-time-state-legislation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, 18 states have passed legislation or enacted resolutions that would switch to permanent daylight saving time if Congress allowed it (and in some cases, if surrounding states also made the change).</p>


<div><iframe title="More than a third of states want DST year-round" aria-label="Map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zADPk/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="640" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, federal law doesn’t currently allow for permanent daylight saving time, so Congress has to take the lead, which is why the bill that just passed is a big step for proponents of daylight saving time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Originally, daylight saving time was implemented during World War I as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/climate/daylight-saving-time-electricity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a way to conserve energy</a>. The idea was that changing the clocks during the months with the most sunlight would encourage people to use less electricity. That <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/01/1050492391/daylight-saving-time-history-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t seem to be the case</a>, though. Instead, the real winners of daylight saving time are <a href="https://www.convenience.org/Media/Daily/2022/Mar/14/1-Daylight-Saving-Time-Is-Good-for-Business_GR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">businesses</a>, since people are <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/who-really-benefits-daylight-savings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to go out and shop</a> when they have an extra hour or two of sunlight after work. So, a switch to permanent daylight saving time would be <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/01/1050492391/daylight-saving-time-history-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a boon</a> for lots of industries — especially those for outdoor activities like sports and gardening.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What everyday people actually want, though, isn’t as clear. Polling shows that people generally don’t like the disruption of gaining or losing an hour twice a year, although their feelings might not be as strong as politicians make it out to be. In an <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/xtubiu759r/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted days before the clocks changed in November, for instance, only 21 percent of Americans said they were looking forward to the end of daylight saving time coming up, while 34 percent said they weren’t looking forward to it; 38 percent said they didn’t care. But there was more consensus on the concept of changing the clocks than on the solution: Among the 63 percent of people who wanted to eliminate the practice of gaining or losing an hour, 48 percent said they wanted permanent daylight saving time, 29 percent said they wanted permanent standard time and 21 percent had no preference.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Older Americans, it turns out, are also much more likely than younger Americans to dislike the time changes. The Economist/YouGov poll found that an overwhelming majority of respondents 65 and over (77 percent) wanted to eliminate the twice-yearly time change compared with less than half of respondents age 18 to 29 (42 percent). To be clear, those younger people aren’t strongly in favor of keeping the clock change: They were just about as likely to say they didn't want to change the clocks (27 percent) as they were to say they weren't sure (31 percent). But they were also less in favor of permanent daylight saving time than older people were, by 30 percent to 54 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This division could hint at one of the big reasons why people really don’t like changing the clocks: It can be physically disruptive. Messing with sleep patterns can affect our <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/daylight-savings-shows-how-your-metabolism-works-on-a-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating habits</a> or <a href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/daylight-saving-time-sleep-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental functioning</a> throughout the day. And an abrupt shift like adding or losing an hour can be especially troublesome for <a href="https://www.agingcare.com/articles/daylight-saving-time-health-156410.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older people</a>, who may already have more fragmented sleep. It can also upset bedtimes and nap routines for <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/parents/daylight-saving-time-sleep-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small children</a>, and even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pets-dogs-cats-daylight-savings-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make pets fussy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in exchange for later sunsets, people have to be OK with dark mornings. And that’s not a universally popular tradeoff. Americans actually experimented with permanent daylight saving time starting in January 1974, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/15/no-more-changing-clocks-history-says-be-careful-what-you-wish-daylight-saving-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it didn’t go well</a>. As reported in The Washington Post, support for year-round daylight saving time fell from a majority in late 1973 to around 30 percent in February and March 1974. According to Louis Harris polling that March, people were much more likely to say the change was a bad idea (43 percent) than a good one (19 percent). Parents who found themselves sending their children to school on pitch-black, cold winter mornings were particularly upset.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment ended that fall, when the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/01/archives/senate-votes-return-to-standard-time-for-four-months-and-sends-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Senate agreed&lt;/a&gt; to scrap permanent daylight saving time and &lt;a href="https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0055/1668702.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;President Gerald Ford signed&lt;/a&gt; the bill into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a> But anyone who wakes up on the early side — <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/wake-me-up-series-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which many Americans do</a> — might also dislike slogging through an extra hour of darkness as they begin their day. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/get-ready-to-spring-forward-into-daylight-saving-time-and-longer-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleep scientists</a> have argued that permanent standard time is <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2022/03/12/daylight-saving-time-spring-forward-fall-back-change-clocks-sleep-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more in sync</a> with our body’s natural rhythms. We might like an extra hour of light at the end of the day, their argument goes, but we <em>need</em> that extra hour of morning light. And regional differences play a role, too. It’s probably no coincidence that one of permanent daylight saving time’s biggest boosters is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, since states farther south <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/@3558773?month=1&amp;year=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t running the risk</a> of a 9 a.m. sunrise, even at the darkest times of year. But <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/what-would-happen-if-michigan-kept-daylight-saving-time-all-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">northern states</a>, and states on the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-daylight-saving-time-poses-a-host-of-health-concerns-according-to-a-neurologist#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cwestern%20edge%E2%80%9D%20effect,edge%20of%20a%20time%20zone." target="_blank" rel="noopener">western edges of time zones</a>, would face longer stretches of morning darkness.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another possibility, of course, is to stop putting all the weight of adjusting to the seasons onto the clocks and instead tweak our own schedules to gradually move the start time of our day. But that’s harder to legislate, so we’re left with some pretty unsatisfying options. We can keep dealing with the hassle of changing the clocks — or we can accept that, for a few months at least, we’ll either start or end our days in the dark. Which would you choose?</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-economic-impact/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-economic-impact/">Lower-income workers, in particular, have faced difficulties during the omicron surge</a> of the coronavirus, according to a Feb. 9-21 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor, 60 percent of workers living in a household making less than $40,000 annually said they had missed work in the past three months due to concerns over COVID-19, versus 33 percent of workers whose households earned between $40,000 and $89,999 annually and 43 percent of workers whose households made $90,000 or more annually. Moreover, just 32 percent of workers in lower-income households received paid time off if they got sick from COVID-19, compared with 57 percent of workers in households making $40,000 or more per year. Because these lower-income workers lack paid time off, a greater share came to work sick — 29 percent of workers in households making less than $40,000 annually said they went to work while symptomatic or after exposure to COVID-19 because they couldn’t afford to take time off; just 6 percent of workers in households making $40,000 or more said they had to do the same.</li></ul><ul><li>The <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/15/f1-fandom-netflix/">share of Americans who call themselves fans of a motorsport has revved up</a> in the past two years, according to polls from Morning Consult conducted Feb. 20-23, 2020, and March 5-7, 2022. While NASCAR still had the greatest share of fans, at 40 percent, Formula 1 saw its fan base increase the most (from 21 percent in 2020 to 28 percent in 2022), though MotoGP’s increase was a close second, at 6 percentage points. NASCAR, IndyCar and NHRA all gained fans, too, though by a more modest amount. The Netflix documentary series “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” which chronicles the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-drive-to-survive-remade-formula-1">annual struggle for the Formula One World Championship</a>, seems to be driving this boost in popularity. More than half of self-identified Formula 1 fans in the U.S. (53 percent) said the show, which <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/10/formula-1-drive-to-survive/619814/">developed a cult following</a> since its debut in 2019, was a major or minor reason why they became a fan.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/03/14/most-climate-scientists-expect-catastrophe">Climate scientists sound far more pessimistic than the American public</a> about the consequences of climate change, according to a September 2021 survey by Nature that polled authors and review editors of the latest report by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a March 10-13 U.S. News Poll of American adults by YouGov that asked the same questions. For example, while just 25 percent of Americans said they thought they would see catastrophic impacts of climate change in their lifetimes, 66 percent of the climate scientists who responded to the Nature survey said the same. Meanwhile, just 35 percent of Americans said they felt anxiety, grief or other distress due to concerns about climate change, versus 61 percent of the experts polled. That said, as to whether climate-related concerns might overrule one’s desire to have children, climate scientists were roughly in line with the general public, even though research has found that having one fewer child is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children">the most effective thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint</a>. Just 17 percent of the climate scientists who answered the question said global warming has made them reconsider having children, versus 18 percent of the general public.</li></ul><ul><li>According to a March 3-7 poll from Navigator, <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-support-judge-kentanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-to-the-court/">President Biden and the Democratic Party have an edge over the GOP</a> when it comes to which party Americans trust more to “put the right people on the Supreme Court.” Forty-six percent of registered voters said they trusted Biden and the Democrats more, while 39 percent said they trusted Republicans more. A slight majority (51 percent) of voters said they would support the Senate confirming Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, including 73 percent of voters who said they were familiar with her, while 27 percent of all voters were undecided and 22 percent opposed the confirmation.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/03/15/public-expresses-mixed-views-of-u-s-response-to-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/">Democrats and Republicans are largely united</a> on U.S. economic and military strategy toward Russia, but they seem more divided on accepting Ukrainian refugees, according to a March 7-13 poll from the Pew Research Center. For instance, Pew found that an overwhelming majority of Democrats (88 percent) and Republicans (85 percent) supported “keeping strict economic sanctions on Russia,” while just over a third (35 percent of Democrats, 36 percent of Republicans) supported “taking military action even if it risks a nuclear conflict with Russia.” But the parties sharply diverged when asked about “admitting thousands of Ukrainian refugees into the U.S.” — 80 percent of Democrats supported this policy versus 57 percent of Republicans, a 23-point gap.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">The conventional wisdom is that if former President Donald Trump wants the GOP presidential nomination in 2024, it’s his. But some Republicans are still jockeying for position to be the next leader of the party, the most prominent of which may be Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. He is considered to be in the political mold of Trump, just more disciplined. And this week DeSantis closed out a state legislative session full of conservative culture-war priorities that may well be geared toward a national audience. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Galen Druke speaks with Florida reporters <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/profile/244900712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ana Ceballos</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/staff/matt-dixon" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.politico.com/staff/matt-dixon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Dixon</a> about where DeSantis falls ideologically, how he’s shaped state politics and how he could shape the Republican Party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It may get the most attention, but partisanship is not the only way to measure how fair <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the country’s new congressional maps</a> are. Equally important is how well they represent communities of color. And on this front, the congressional lines that will be used in the 2022 election leave a lot to be desired.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In theory, under the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voting Rights Act</a>, every racial group must be given equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. When it comes to <a href="http://www.publicmapping.org/what-is-redistricting/redistricting-criteria-the-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>, this means drawing districts where nonwhite voters are the dominant voting bloc — enough to reasonably ensure they can elect their preferred candidate — <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1429826/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whenever possible</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this interpretation of the Voting Rights Act has been under siege lately by conservatives who believe it is <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=127399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unconstitutional</a>. And with the current conservative makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court, Republican legislatures have shown a willingness to push the boundaries of the law, minimizing the number of nonwhite districts (which usually vote Democratic) in order to maximize the number of Republican ones. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To complicate matters further, there is no agreed-upon standard for how diverse a district needs to be in order to elect a minority’s preferred candidate; even those who support the broader goal of more nonwhite representation often disagree. (For example, if Black voters constitute a majority of the primary electorate in a heavily Democratic district, that district could still elect Black voters’ candidate of choice even if Black voters are a minority of the district as a whole.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In practice, this means states often end up drawing fewer predominantly nonwhite districts than are possible. Just look at the most recent redistricting cycle’s report card. On the one hand, nonwhite Americans — namely Latinos — did gain clout in some states, but they lost it in others. And most importantly, racial minorities didn’t gain representation in several states where they easily could have.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with a positive development for nonwhite representation: Several new predominantly Hispanic congressional seats were created this redistricting cycle. (This makes sense, given that the Hispanic population of the U.S. increased by at least 11.6 million people between the <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Hispanic%20or%20Latino&amp;g=0100000US&amp;y=2010&amp;tid=DECENNIALPLNAT2010.P2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2010</a> and <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Hispanic%20or%20Latino&amp;g=0100000US&amp;y=2020&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a> censuses, accounting for more than 51 percent of the country’s growth on net during that period — and the fact that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/10/1083732104/2020-census-accuracy-undercount-overcount-data-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Latinos were undercounted</a> could mean they accounted for even more.) For example, the voting-age population<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I.e., the population age 18 or older. All district demographics for the remainder of the article are based on VAP rather than total population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> of Illinois’s 3rd District, which was previously 58 percent white and 31 percent Hispanic, is now 44 percent Hispanic and 43 percent white, giving the Chicago area two seats now where Latinos are the biggest racial group.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, we’re considering Hispanic or Latino ethnicity to be a race to make an apples-to-apples comparison with white, Black and Asian American populations. As a result, the terms “white,” “Black” and “Asian American” on their own refer specifically to non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic Asian American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But by far the biggest source of new Hispanic seats was California, whose redistricting commission appeared to <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1472965510748950534?s=20&amp;t=DSLVdnDj8Z1iY88M-MNzNg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go out of its way</a> to create new opportunities for the state’s <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Hispanic%20or%20Latino&amp;g=0400000US06&amp;y=2020&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest racial group</a>. California’s old congressional map had 13 districts where Latinos constituted a majority of the VAP; the new one has 18 (despite the fact that California lost a seat overall due to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reapportionment</a>!). This was accomplished by spreading the state’s Hispanic population more evenly among districts.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">True, Latinos were already a <em>plurality</em> of the VAP in most of the districts that have become majority Hispanic (all but the new 13th District), but in many cases the shift was still meaningful. For example, Latinos were 36 percent of the VAP in the old 19th District, but Asian Americans and whites were not far behind at 31 percent and 26 percent, respectively. In other words, Latinos were hardly guaranteed to get their preferred representative. However, the new version of this seat (renumbered the 18th District) is now 61 percent Hispanic, giving Latino Americans a much better shot at electing the candidate of their choice. It’s a similar story in the new 25th, 37th and 43rd districts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was the extent of the gains, however. On the flip side, there are also several districts where the ability of nonwhite people — especially Black people — to elect the candidate of their choice has been thrown into question. For example, the two districts covering Detroit (Michigan’s 13th and 14th districts) were each formerly 53 percent Black by VAP. But their successors (renumbered the 12th and 13th districts, respectively) are significantly less so. The 13th District is 45 percent Black and 40 percent white, while the 12th District is 47 percent white and just 44 percent Black. While it’s still possible that these districts will elect Black voters’ preferred candidates, it’s less likely than it was before. (In fact, voting-rights advocates filed a lawsuit over the map earlier this year for this very reason, but <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2022/02/03/michigan-supreme-court-upholds-redistricting-commission-maps/9226313002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was dismissed</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Something similar happened with Georgia’s 2nd District and North Carolina’s 1st District. These districts, which have historically elected Black candidates, got ever so slightly less Black (Georgia’s 2nd went from 49 percent Black and 41 percent white to 48 percent Black and 43 percent white; North Carolina’s 1st went from 48 percent white and 41 percent Black to 50 percent white and 40 percent Black). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This may not seem like a big deal, but because voting in the South is so polarized by race, this was enough to make each district a few percentage points more Republican; Georgia’s 2nd went from a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> of D+6 to D+4, while North Carolina’s 1st went from a partisan lean of D+7 to D+5. In other words, they are competitive enough that it’s possible that Republicans will win them in 2022, which is already shaping up to be a good midterm environment for the GOP. If so, these districts will have failed to elect Black voters’ preferred candidate for the first time in decades.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Latinos weren’t immune from being squeezed by redistricting, either. For example, Nevada’s 1st District used to have a Hispanic plurality (41 percent, vs. 32 percent white). But Democrats redrew <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada’s congressional map</a> to maximize the number of seats they would win, which required “unpacking” the 1st District and its Hispanic community. As a result, the new 1st District is 44 percent white and only 32 percent Hispanic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The worst news for nonwhite representation this cycle, however, was the progress that was not made. In several states, people of color did not gain electoral control of seats that have historically been denied to them or that they were arguably entitled to because of population growth.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas is the canonical example of the latter. The Lone Star State grew by 4 million people between the <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Hispanic%20or%20Latino&amp;g=0400000US48&amp;y=2010&amp;tid=DECENNIALPLNAT2010.P2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2010</a> and <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Hispanic%20or%20Latino&amp;g=0400000US48&amp;y=2020&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a> censuses — earning the state two more congressional districts — and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/12/texas-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95 percent of that growth was, on net, due to people of color</a>. However, the state went from 18 majority-minority districts to … 18 majority-minority districts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, Latinos alone accounted for almost half of the state’s net growth, yet the number of districts with a Latino majority or plurality actually decreased from 12 to 11. Rather than gaining congressional districts of their own, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/12/13/latinos-texas-redistricting-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burgeoning nonwhite communities in places like Dallas</a> were <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/15/texas-redistricting-dallas-fort-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carved up and parceled out to predominantly white, rural districts</a> in order to protect Republican incumbents from the forces of demographic change.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, people of color made up 68 percent of Colorado’s growth, on net, between the <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Hispanic%20or%20Latino&amp;g=0400000US08&amp;y=2010&amp;tid=DECENNIALPLNAT2010.P2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2010</a> and <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Hispanic%20or%20Latino&amp;g=0400000US08&amp;y=2020&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a> censuses, and many advocates were hoping that this would finally be the year that Colorado <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-denver-colorado-redistricting-race-and-ethnicity-f70b53cc580c16c3ab3014ece268a22b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drew a predominantly Latino district</a>. It didn’t happen, however: The state’s least white district (the new 8th District) is 56 percent white and only 35 percent Hispanic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in the South, Black people have <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/7/15/1383616/-Nearly-every-Southern-state-could-have-drawn-another-congressional-seat-that-would-elect-a-minority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been underrepresented in the House</a>, and their situation did not improve during this round of redistricting. In Arkansas, Democrats <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arkansas/hb1962/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed a map</a> that would have made the 2nd District 53 percent white and 37 percent Black, which might have been enough to elect Black voters’ preferred candidate. Similarly, Georgia Democrats <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/georgia/dem_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed a map</a> that would have turned the 10th District into a 41 percent Black, 39 percent white seat closer to Atlanta. Neither map, however, passed the states’ Republican-controlled legislatures, and the Arkansas 2nd that ended up passing is 69 percent white and 19 percent Black, while the Georgia 10th is 66 percent white and 21 percent Black.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Arkansas and Georgia maps are currently subject to <a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2022/03/07/federal-suit-challenges-arkansas-congressional-districts-over-racial-gerrymandering-of-2nd-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial-gerrymandering</a> <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/12/31/lawsuits-claim-georgias-redistricting-maps-ignore-black-population-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits</a>, but they’re unlikely to be overturned given what transpired in voting-rights advocates’ legal quest to add another Black seat in Alabama. After Alabama passed a congressional map that, like its old one, featured six majority-white seats and only one majority-Black seat, advocates sued, arguing that the Voting Rights Act required the state to have two Black districts. (Remember, the act theoretically requires states to draw districts where nonwhite voters are the dominant voting bloc whenever possible — and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps</a> drawn by the plaintiffs <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> that such a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">configuration</a> was <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indeed very possible</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A panel of three federal judges <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/24/alabama-congressional-map-blocked-federal-court/9205925002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a>, but after Alabama appealed their ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/07/1078292766/supreme-court-lets-alabama-use-gop-backed-map-of-the-states-congressional-distri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determined</a> it was too close to the 2022 election for the map to be overturned. This extinguished hopes not only that Black Alabamians would gain another seat in Congress, but also that courts would pave the way for drawing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">additional Black districts in states like Louisiana and South Carolina</a>, which, like Alabama, each have only one majority-Black seat but could support one more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court will issue a final decision on the Alabama case as part of its 2022-23 term, but given the court’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-just-made-it-harder-to-fight-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history of weakening the Voting Rights Act</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/24/1003049852/supreme-court-adds-affirmative-action-to-its-potential-hit-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">willingness to consider other challenges to civil-rights policies</a>, it is unlikely to err on the side of more nonwhite representation. More likely, it will change the historical interpretation of the Voting Rights Act and water down the act’s protections of minority districts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this way, the legacy of this redistricting cycle for people of color could be even worse than not giving them more representation; it could undermine the very law designed to ensure their enfranchisement.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): In the last two weeks or so, President Biden’s approval rating has ticked up from 41.1 percent to 42.9 percent, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> The share of Americans who disapprove of the job he’s doing has ticked down, too, from 53.6 percent to 52.3 percent.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2046" height="904" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-6.02.09-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-6.02.09-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-6.02.09-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-6.02.09-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Historically, State of the Union addresses <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-first-state-of-the-union-might-not-change-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t moved the needle much</a>, but Biden seems to have benefited at least a little bit from his March 1 address — perhaps in large part because it allowed him to once again address Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the U.S.’s response.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to know whether this current bump will last, but let’s tackle Biden’s approval rating in two parts. First, what do we know about why his approval rating has ticked up? Can we point to certain issues or groups where his standing has improved? Second, how should we think about this uptick? Is it a sign of things turning around for Biden, or is it more of a blip?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, first up, why do we think Biden’s approval rating is inching up?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): It’s impossible to totally disentangle all the events of the past month or so, but I think the simplest answer (which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually the right one</a>) is the crisis in Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-bounce-for-biden-following-state-of-the-union-march-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Marist/NPR/PBS</a>, Biden’s approval/disapproval spread on the issue of Ukraine shot up from 34/50 in mid-February to 52/44 in early March. His overall approval/disapproval increased from 39/55 to 47/50. And <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/08/biden-approval-improves-state-of-the-union-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Morning Consult/Politico</a>, his approval/disapproval on Ukraine went from 42/45 in late February to 46/42 in early March. His overall approval/disapproval went from 41/56 to 45/51 over that same span. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/amelia-thomson-deveaux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</a>, senior writer): At the start of the Ukraine crisis, Americans were on board with the steps that Biden was taking but still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-will-americans-grade-bidens-handling-of-the-crisis-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t approve of his handling of the crisis</a>. It now seems, though, that some folks are giving him credit. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Exactly, Amelia. And I think overall media coverage has had more to do with that than the State of the Union. Cable news has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-care-about-the-invasion-of-ukraine-but-that-doesnt-mean-they-will-rally-around-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered the war in Ukraine very intensely</a>. For example, on Feb. 24, the day after Russia started its invasion,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia actually started to invade early on the morning of Feb. 24 in Ukraine, but it was still late on Feb. 23 in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=Ukraine&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20220101000000&amp;edt=20220313235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fcs=comb&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;fdt=-05%3A00&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukraine was mentioned in 3,095 15-second clips on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC</a>. To put that in perspective, on Election Day 2020, former President Donald Trump was mentioned by name in <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=trump&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20201101000000&amp;edt=20201108235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fcs=comb&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;fdt=-05%3A00&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 2,675 clips</a>.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran a search of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC coverage so far this year in the Television News Archive using the GDELT Television API. In that database, daily news footage is split into 15-second clips, and searches return the clips that contain a mention of our search query (“Ukraine”). The cutoff for measuring coverage for any given day is midnight Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a></p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Ukraine is dominating cable news" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nbA1g/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="575" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That level of media coverage matters, especially when Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-currently-support-sanctioning-russia-for-invading-ukraine-but-are-reluctant-to-deploy-troops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally approve of the actions Biden is taking</a> with regard to Ukraine, and is likely more responsible than the State of the Union address for the uptick we see in his approval rating.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Although in fairness, Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/us/politics/biden-sotu-transcript.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked a lot about the war in Ukraine</a> in his State of the Union address, which may have contributed to some of that coverage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bigger question for me, though, is who is changing their minds on Biden? Last month, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-have-been-souring-on-biden-since-last-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex<strong> </strong>Samuels and I wrote a story</a> documenting how Biden seemed to have lost his shine among some Democrats starting last summer. If what we're seeing is mostly just Democrats coming back into the fold, that's not as dramatic as a shift among independents (or even — in a crazy world — Republicans!).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst): Right, I don't think we have quite enough data yet to declare that it's down to Democrats supporting Biden more, but that would make the most sense. If Biden's approval ticks up further, that's what I'm mainly watching for. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> A recent Morning Consult poll indicated Democrats and independents were driving <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/08/biden-approval-improves-state-of-the-union-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the shift in Biden's approval</a>, but as you said, Geoffrey, it's early days.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> What do we see in the data we have so far? After all, a 2-point bump from March 1 <em>isn't</em> a huge shift.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> No, Sarah, it's not a huge shift, and I think that's reflective of the fact that Biden is facing very real headwinds such as inflation. Americans still say <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-poll-biden-ukraine-inflation-midterms-11646975533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy is their top — or one of their top — issues</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> It’s really hard to say. Some polls have shown Biden gaining, while others have shown his approval largely unchanged. For instance, CBS News/YouGov put Biden's approval at 44 percent <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-biden-state-of-the-union-opinion-poll-2022-02-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in late February</a>, and at 43 percent (so basically the same) <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-sanctions-gas-prices-opinion-poll-2022-03-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a week and a half into March</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, Quinnipiac also found his overall approval/disapproval mostly unchanged, <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3835" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from 35/55 in mid-February</a> to <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38/51 in early March</a>, even as Americans warmed to his handling of Ukraine, which went from 34/54 to 42/45. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> So ... maybe Biden's approval rating isn't rebounding?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Well, I think it's important to remember that this is happening in the context of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-americans-may-or-may-not-blame-biden-for-higher-gas-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big spike in gas prices</a> — which would normally be terrible news for a president's approval rating.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our colleague Santul Nerkar wrote in December <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why inflation is such a powerful political issue</a>, and as you can see in the chart below, inflation often coincides with a sharp drop in a president’s approval </p>

It could be a short-lived buffer for Biden if the war drags on and gas prices keep going up.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Biden’s approval rating has more or less ticked up to where it was in January, but it’s still a <em>very</em> small shift.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, that isn’t that surprising given just how polarized our politics are; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-should-still-pay-attention-to-joe-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small shifts in presidential approval are the order of the day</a> now.<strong> </strong>Rather, what has been surprising about Biden’s approval rating is how much <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it dropped in the late summer and early fall</a>, around the time of the messy withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and the surge in the delta variant of the coronavirus in the U.S. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s approval rating declined by nearly 8 points from late July to early September last year, which marked a sharp drop over a fairly short period. Such a sizable and quick swing is unusual in our day and age, in which presidential approval has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to be pretty stable</a>. This may have partly been due to Biden’s “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-should-we-expect-of-bidens-approval-rating-in-the-first-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeymoon period</a>” ending pretty quickly, but it was still a precipitous slide: In our historical approval data, Trump’s approval rating never dropped that much in any month-and-a-half period, and former President Barack Obama’s did just once.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Do you think we're in a situation, Geoffrey, where presidential approval no longer rebounds quickly? Compared to past periods, it seems easier in our gloomy political era for voters to quickly turn on a president than it is to suddenly decide he's doing OK after all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Amelia, I would not rule it out entirely, but it would probably take fairly special circumstances, like a particularly strong rally-’round-the-flag moment — a stronger one than we're in now. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Ah, Geoffrey, you’ve stumbled onto one of my pet peeves! To paraphrase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vimZj8HW0Kg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LL Cool J</a>, don’t call it a rally-’round-the-flag effect!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As I wrote earlier this month, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-care-about-the-invasion-of-ukraine-but-that-doesnt-mean-they-will-rally-around-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rally-’round-the-flag effect has two specific causes</a>: heightened patriotism and a lack of criticism from opposition parties. But I’d argue neither condition is met in the U.S. right now. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, I would say what we’re seeing is a very rational public reaction to Biden's handling of the crisis. This may seem like an academic distinction, but I think it's an important one. After all, rally-’round-the-flag effects are about emotion: “I love America, and therefore I love our president!” But Americans’ response to what’s happening in Ukraine has been more rational: “I approve of the president's actions, and therefore I like our president (marginally) more.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> One thing that is shifting, though, is that Americans are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/12/upshot/ukraine-russia-ally-enemy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to see Russia as an enemy</a> and more likely to see Ukraine as a friendly country or an ally. Interestingly, that shift is happening among both Republicans and Democrats, which could explain why we’re not seeing more of a shift in Biden’s approval rating. People are having a reaction to the war — maybe even an emotional one — but it's dampened by partisanship. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Not to mention, there are so many other factors weighing Biden down, such as inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, gas prices, etc. If the status quo of any of those issues suddenly improved, Biden's approval would likely improve, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Put another way, you need a <em>real</em> rally-’round-the-flag effect to overshadow those issues now, which, to Nathaniel's point, hasn’t happened. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Speaking of which … Americans still generally don’t approve of how Biden is handling the economy and/or the pandemic, right? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Well, his approval rating on the pandemic has actually improved. In fact, in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our coronavirus presidential approval tracker</a>, he rose above water in early March for the first time since early January. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2018" height="750" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-6.00.27-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-6.00.27-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-6.00.27-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-6.00.27-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This could reflect the fact that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case counts are way down again</a> as the omicron surge has faded — which, of course, could be another reason why Biden’s overall approval rating has ticked up.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> At the same time, though, Americans aren’t quite as concerned with the coronavirus as they once were. According to Gallup, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 percent of Americans</a> said it was the country's most important problem in February, which is not low in the grand scheme of things, but it is <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354026/satisfaction-drops-covid-resurges-top-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notably less important to Americans than it has been over the past two years</a>. For much of 2021, around 20 percent or more named the coronavirus as the country’s top challenge, and 45 percent <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/349205/fewer-cite-coronavirus-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered that way in April 2020</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> There’s also some evidence that Americans don’t trust Democrats to handle the pandemic as much as they once did. A recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-poll-biden-ukraine-inflation-midterms-11646975533?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal poll</a> found that voters thought Democrats were best able to handle the pandemic — compared to Republicans — by an 11-point margin, but that’s down 5 percentage points from mid-November. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, as Geoffrey said, the pandemic isn’t the key issue it once was for voters; instead, it’s the economy. And on that issue, Biden gets abysmal ratings. Sixty-three percent of voters said they “somewhat” or “strongly” disapproved of Biden’s handling of inflation and rising costs in that Wall Street Journal poll, with 47 percent saying they thought Republicans were best equipped to handle inflation, versus 30 percent who preferred Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> There are just so many forces working against Biden right now. People are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/politics/unhappiness-americans-gallup-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super unhappy</a> in general. It's not hard to see why they'd blame the president for that unhappiness — fairly or unfairly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> The buck stops here, as former President Harry Truman <a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/trivia/buck-stops-here-sign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famously noted</a>, and that's how it goes as president — you get to enjoy the good, but you have to suffer the bad, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> What should we make of Biden's approval rating, then? Is it showing signs of rebounding? Or not really?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> I think it's a good sign for Biden that he's getting some Democratic enthusiasm back. He's also on track to appoint <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Black woman to the Supreme Court</a> — that's a campaign promise he's making good on. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maybe things are going from really dire to only kinda sorta dire? That’s, of course, based on my very scientific direness scale. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Biden’s approval has ticked up, but I'm not sure I would call it a rebound. I think we have to wait and see whether his approval rating climbs a bit more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And to Amelia's point, perhaps that happens due to other factors, like his Supreme Court pick, although I think it’s safe to assume that what’s happening in Ukraine will continue to overshadow most things besides inflation. Still, Biden could benefit if people continue to be OK with his handling of the crisis. Of course that could change, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> I also think we'll have to see how things go. If the war in Ukraine slogs on and prices keep going up, people might stop giving Biden so much credit for his handling of the war — and blame him even more for the economic fallout of the conflict. That's not where we're at right now, obviously, but I could see us getting there in the future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> On "The Bachelor," contestants often say “I'm falling in love with you” instead of “I love you” because, well, they've only known these people for a few weeks. In the same vein, yes, Biden's approval rating is “showing signs of rebounding,” but it certainly hasn't “rebounded.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Like most presidents, Donald Trump changed the political party he led. But Trump was hardly a normal president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was apparent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/lifestyle/magazine/trump-presidential-norm-breaking-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">while Trump was president</a>, but in many ways that’s even easier to understand now that he is out of office. Unlike previous presidents, Trump has refused to take a step back from the limelight. Instead, he has continued to try and be the party’s kingmaker, playing a far more active role in the 2022 primaries than he did in 2018 and 2020. His <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements have gotten bolder</a> and more aggressive down ballot, and he’s often used them to root out those who oppose him or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/us/politics/election-deniers-secretary-of-state.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his false claims about the 2020 election results</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">He also still commands <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/02/trump-desantis-close-2024-florida/9302491002/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considerable personal loyalty</a> among <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-majority-of-republican-voters-actively-want-trump-to-run-for-president-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters within the party</a>. But as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-might-still-be-trumps-party-but-that-doesnt-mean-theres-room-for-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’ve written before</a>, there is evidence that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trumps-hold-on-the-gop-still-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alliance</a> between Republicans and Trump is uneasy, and it could test how much clout he carries in the party. To be sure, that doesn’t mean we should <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-republicans-ever-turn-on-trump-itll-happen-all-at-once/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expect Republicans to break from Trump en masse</a>, but nevertheless, there are signs that both Trump’s style and ideas are evolving as other politicians take them up and inevitably change them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the last few years, a number of ambitious politicians have established a national name for themselves by claiming the Trumpist mantle — all while offering voters their <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/06/nikki-haley-plots-republican-party-future-with-without-trump/6001710001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own interpretations of Trump-style conservatism</a>. This group includes governors like Ron DeSantis of Florida and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia; senators like Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri; and even erstwhile members of the Trump administration like former Vice President Mike Pence and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though a few of these figures, like Cruz and Haley, had national ambitions prior to the Trump era, many became national figures starting in 2016 and thus created political profiles inextricably linked to Trump. Let’s take a look, then, at how these aspiring GOP leaders are reinventing — or resisting — Trumpism and what this might mean for the future of the Republican Party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The first category of note is politicians who have tried to distance themselves from Trump’s political style without really rejecting any of his views. The most prominent example of a GOP politician in this group is probably Youngkin, whose November 2021 victory in the Virginia gubernatorial race could serve as a model for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-republican/2021/10/08/f4fa9cc2-2566-11ec-8d53-67cfb452aa60_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-style candidates running in purple states</a>. What remains to be seen is whether this type of Trumpian politician will be any more successful at governing than Trump was. Youngkin’s administration so far has veered to the right and relied heavily on culture war tactics like going after <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/01/25/gov-youngkin-sets-up-tip-line-report-divisive-teaching-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a> in schools, which hasn’t <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/poll-shows-many-virginia-voters-disagree-with-governor-youngkin-on-masks-critical-race-theory/65-9e1360c5-bdf9-4f86-af4a-6859812dcdc2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proved popular among voters</a> in the state. It’s possible that this approach isn’t a political winner in a purple state, even when the Democratic brand is struggling. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some Republicans have gone further than Youngkin, though, explicitly trying to separate loyalty to Trump and his policy positions from believing in the Big Lie, the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Former New Jersey Gov. and Trump transition leader Chris Christie, who has also criticized Trump’s general approach to politics, has said, for instance, that the Republican Party needs to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/chris-christie-urges-republicans-to-drop-election-lies-conspiracies-this-has-to-stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move on from false beliefs</a> about the last presidential election. He also recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/politics/chris-christie-trump-republicans-january-6/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt</a> that Trump incited the Jan. 6 riot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pence has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/politics/pence-trump-rebuke-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also publicly contradicted</a> Trump, suggesting that Trump was wrong to claim that the vice president could “overturn” the results when Congress met to count the Electoral College votes. He’s also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/pence-hits-trump-room-gop-apologists-putin-83258089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repudiated Trump’s embrace</a> of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, Haley has tried to strike more of a middle-of-the-road approach, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/nikki-haley-calls-pence-saying-021027757.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticizing Pence’s rebuke of Trump</a> while maintaining publicly that Biden won the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nikki-haley-embraces-trump-in-her-vision-of-gop-future-11633424400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election</a>. In other words, there’s a not-so-insubstantial faction of Republicans trying to split the difference when it comes to Trumpism. They derive some of their national stature from their affiliation with Trump but disavow some of his more extreme positions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some Republicans, though, have broken even more decisively with Trump. Members of this group vary in their relationship to Trump’s legislative agenda — some actually backed core components of his policy goals — but they’re nonetheless distinct from others in the party in that they’re not trying to reinterpret Trumpism; rather, they’re aiming  to distance themselves from it. Some prominent Republicans who fall into this group include Reps. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-liz-cheney-calls-trump-unfit-future-office/story?id=82039304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liz Cheney of Wyoming</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/29/1050454729/gop-rep-adam-kinzinger-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-wont-run-for-reelection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Kinzinger</a> of Illinois and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/congress-electoral-college-tally-live-updates/2021/01/06/953945397/called-a-traitor-by-trump-supporters-romney-says-president-disrespected-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sens. Mitt Romney</a> of Utah, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/05/ben-sasse-2024-466424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Sasse of Nebraska</a> and <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/01/08/alaska-sen-lisa-murkowski-calls-on-president-trump-to-resign-questions-her-future-as-a-republican/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa Murkowski</a> of Alaska. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A key distinction, though, between these figures and Republicans like Christie, Pence or Haley is that it’s even harder to imagine any of the former entering or gaining traction in a GOP presidential primary. The presence of a more outwardly anti-Trump faction is still significant, though, as it raises questions about the viability of the larger party coalition. Currently, it appears that members of this group will be ostracized. For instance, Cheney and Kinzinger have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/us/politics/republicans-jan-6-cheney-censure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured by the Republican National Committee</a>. Cheney also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-there-no-place-for-liz-cheney-in-the-modern-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost her leadership position</a> for her comments about the 2020 election and support for Trump’s second impeachment, and Kinzinger, who also supported Trump’s second impeachment, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/29/rep-adam-kinzinger-wont-seek-reelection-next-year-517599" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t seeking reelection</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the polar opposite of the firmly anti-Trump group are those in the party who seem to be trying to out-Trump Trump, or leaning into the most bombastic reimagining of Trumpism possible. This group most prominently includes DeSantis, who has tried to establish himself as the 2024 front-runner of this wing of the party. As such, he has positioned himself as a leading figure in the <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2021/12/15/governor-desantis-announces-legislative-proposal-to-stop-w-o-k-e-activism-and-critical-race-theory-in-schools-and-corporations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP’s fight</a> to curtail <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2022/03/08/florida-abortion-law-ban-hb-5-florida-abortion-clinic/9414123002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion rights</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dont-gay-bill-passes-florida-senate/story?id=83301889" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ rights</a> and voting rights. He has even criticized Trump from his right, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/desantis-trump-covid-response/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying in January</a> that he regretted not speaking out in 2020 against Trump’s COVID-19 recommendations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Congress, this group includes legislators like <a href="https://www.wpr.org/us-sen-ron-johnson-continues-push-state-lawmakers-take-over-federal-elections-wisconsin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Ron Johnson</a> and Reps. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/18/marjorie-taylor-greene-won-conservative-views-and-donald-trump/4411352001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/30/politics/lauren-boebert-ilhan-omar-video-comments/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Boebert</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-madison-cawthorn-says-there-will-be-bloodshed-if-us-elections-continue-to-be-rigged/2021/08/30/297a9fa2-09c8-11ec-aea1-42a8138f132a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Madison Cawthorn</a> and <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/mccarthy-mtg-marjorie-taylor-greene-paul-gosar-white-nationalist-conference-191118196.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Gosar</a>. Trying to out-Trump Trump has a lot of different expressions, but among this group of Republicans, it broadly refers to their attitudes toward <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/technology/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19</a>, the 2020 election and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163487/madison-cawthorn-beach-ferrara-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electoral democracy</a> in general. This group’s rise to prominence illustrates the appeal of a constituency for an even more extreme version of Trumpism. That said, it’s not clear how broad the appeal is — Greene faces <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/new-poll-shows-the-challenge-and-opportunity-of-a-primary-of-marjorie-taylor-greene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several primary challengers</a> (though she is likely to <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/hopefuls-line-up-to-challenge-marjorie-taylor-greene-but-shell-be-hard-to-beat/LETWBNUQ6VF4HDZYSLDHGHNVBU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep her seat</a>) and is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-americans-think-of-marjorie-taylor-greene-liz-cheney-josh-hawley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular nationally</a>. Meanwhile, Johnson’s popularity in his home state of Wisconsin has <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/25/ron-johnson-unpopular-in-wisconsin-can-he-win-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined since 2020</a>, and he is up for reelection in November. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the post-Trump Republican coalition will look like moving forward. It’s possible that the GOP is now completely dominated by one individual, as evidenced by the purge of those who pushed back on the 45th president’s fraudulent claims that the election was stolen from him. But there are still other voices in the party, including some that have pushed back on some aspects of Trumpism. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, if the largest group of Republicans prove to be that which seeks to reinterpret Trumpism in some way, it’s possible it’ll end up wielding a lot of influence in the party. The key question here is whether these Republicans can carve out their own political identities while still drawing on the past president, as Trump and Trumpism now define the the party’s factions. This is a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/castro-says-he-not-biden-is-the-true-heir-to-obamas-legacy-015755071.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common dilemma</a> for politicians after an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/politics/ronald-reagan-republicans-2016/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influential presidency</a>. And it still remains to be seen whether Trumpism is open to reinterpretation by others, or whether, as is often the case in highly personal political movements, the ideology proves impossible to separate from the leader.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2021, political scientist <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/even-now-republicans-will-stick-together/617803/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hans Noel wrote</a> that Republicans could “agree to disagree about democracy,” citing the need for parties to form broad coalitions in the U.S. political system and the many historical examples of such coalitions exiting despite deep differences within them. But disagreeing over the basic tenets of democracy might prove too much of an intra-party fissure for Republicans to overcome to form a coalition. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact, too, that it is so hard to imagine a post-Trump Republican Party speaks to just how successful Trump has been in seizing control of the party, whether it’s from election officials at the state and local level or <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/republican-national-committee-sues-jan-6-panel-salesforce-subpoena-rcna19427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the RNC</a>. And it’s perhaps the biggest reason why in 2024, as was the case in 2016, a well-known but divisive figure — including Trump himself — might once again step in and fill the void.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Who gets blamed when gas prices go up? And what are the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-americans-may-or-may-not-blame-biden-for-higher-gas-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political consequences</a>? Last week, President Biden announced that the U.S. would ban imports of Russian oil and warned that it would mean higher prices at the pump. That comes after a year of rising prices already. The average cost in the U.S. today is $4.33 per gallon. A year ago, it was $2.86, <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to AAA</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When President Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-ban-russian-oil-imports-energy-products/story?id=83315763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced last week</a> that he was banning Russian oil imports to the United States to retaliate against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he conceded that Americans would pay more for gas as a result. “Defending freedom is going to cost,” Biden said. “It’s going to cost us as well.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But higher prices at the pump and elsewhere aren’t new. For nearly a year now, Americans have faced sharply rising inflation, and the latest numbers were further confirmation of that reality: U.S. prices last month rose 7.9 percent year-over-year, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/economy/us-consumer-price-inflation-february/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest such increase since 1982</a> and a continuation of a worrying trajectory as the country recovers from the pandemic recession and a beaten-down supply chain.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that this trajectory worsens, too, as the global economic outlook has gotten a lot more uncertain following Russia’s invasion late last month. Prices for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-asia-tokyo-sydney-1ac7c193d204266b2901fe420d32c2c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oil</a>, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wheat-continues-surge-toward-all-time-high-as-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-shuts-down-exports-11646664524" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wheat</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/carmakers-face-higher-costs-and-supply-issues-as-price-of-nickel-soars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other resources</a> have skyrocketed as countries around the world impose harsh sanctions against Russian industries, and U.S. gas prices have ticked all the way up to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/energy/record-gas-price/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.17 per gallon</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a precarious situation for Biden because inflation and, in particular, higher gas prices — including those spurred by overseas oil crises — have been shown to drag down presidential approval. At the same time, presidents haven’t always experienced lower approval as a result of these conflicts, so it’s possible that, given the situation in Ukraine, Americans won’t blame Biden for higher gas prices as they have blamed past presidents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Higher gas prices are hardly the only result of inflation, but they are one of the most visible and visceral realities of inflation for Americans. Scholarship has found that consumer sentiment gets <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3267721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly more pessimistic</a> in response to rising gas prices, and that Americans form higher inflation expectations and change their spending habits <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26237/w26237.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when they see higher gas prices</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Higher gas prices have also been shown to drag down presidential approval. As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote back in December</a>, overall inflation has been associated with several periods of downturn in presidential approval, and research has also found that higher gas prices typically have a <a href="https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Presidential-Approval-and-Gas-Prices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant and negative effect on presidents’ approval ratings</a>. But it’s not as simple as higher gas prices meaning lower presidential approval, according to <a href="https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/people/jon-krosnick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Krosnick</a>, a social psychologist at Stanford University who has researched the link between presidential approval and economic indicators. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Namely, situations like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine can play a role in whether Americans blame Biden — or something or someone else, like Russia and Vladimir Putin — for inflation, according to Krosnick. And in this particular situation, it’s possible many Americans will tolerate higher gas prices as a result of sanctions against Russia, according to recent surveys from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/omtmdczu48/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a> and <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The impact of economic indicators on presidential approval depends upon the attribution that the public makes for the cause of economic indicators getting better or worse,” said Krosnick. “In other words, what matters here is whether the president can reasonably be held responsible for what happened to gas prices, or anything else [can].”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, higher gas prices resulting from foreign oil shocks haven’t always worsened presidential approval ratings. Take, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/16/business/economic-scene-the-broad-impact-of-the-gulf-war.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1990 oil shock</a>, which was caused by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 of that year. Even as the price of oil spiked, former president George H.W. Bush’s approval jumped over 16 percentage points in less than a month as the international community swiftly condemned Iraq’s actions, and it rose again after the U.S.-led intervention in early 1991. Moreover, the price of oil <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111114053633/http://www.brookings.edu/economics/bpea/~/media/Files/Programs/ES/BPEA/2009_spring_bpea_papers/2009_spring_bpea_hamilton.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to roughly prior levels</a> in less than a year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unlikely that Biden will see this kind of upswell in his presidential approval rating, but it is true that we haven’t yet seen a drop in his presidential approval to accompany the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-sams-club-lines-as-gas-fuel-prices-soar-2022-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long lines at the pump</a> — in fact, we’ve seen the opposite. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval today</a> is about the same as it was at the start of the Ukraine crisis and has actually rebounded since the initial days of the invasion, a period of time over which prices have risen considerably. He could be seeing <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/08/biden-approval-rating-ukraine-00015065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bump</a> from his State of the Union address and from the Ukraine crisis itself, and as Krosnick noted, U.S. presidential approval often responds positively to international conflicts — even if big swings in approval are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-approval-rating-isnt-bouncing-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly a thing of the past</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One other factor working in Biden’s favor is that the U.S. is far less dependent on foreign oil than it was during the 1973 and 1979 energy crises. “At the time, if OPEC countries decided that they wanted to reduce production, that was it,” said <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/carroll-school/faculty-research/faculty-directory/francesco-dacunto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francesco D’Acunto</a>, a professor of finance at Boston College. “Even if we see that prices are increasing [right now], we haven’t yet observed anything close to what was happening in the late ’70s,” he added. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Biden is still walking a tightrope on inflation. Inflation was high even before a foreign conflict pumped more uncertainty into the U.S. economy, and most Americans disapproved of Biden’s handling <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fMLXPDp_XAlU4X-vC3Q5qSRcle8g245Q/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of inflation prior to the Ukraine crisis</a>. Moreover, as with much polling on foreign policy, voters <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00602.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often take their cues from elites</a> on which policies to support, and it’s quite possible that they’ll end up <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-care-about-the-invasion-of-ukraine-but-that-doesnt-mean-they-will-rally-around-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflecting partisan loyalties</a> when evaluating how Biden has handled what’s happening in Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of that could lead Americans to rate the economy more poorly and, thus, hurt Biden’s political prospects. But it is still far too early to tell whether the conflict’s potentially negative effects on the U.S. economy will be just another economic issue Americans blame him for — or one that they’re willing to tolerate.</p>]]></description>

			<title>How An Uptick In Censures Among Local Republicans Signals A Growing Radicalism</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The Republican National Committee’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-censures-cheney-kinzinger-moves-pull-debates-82678331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censure last month of GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger</a> was a historical rarity — national parties almost never reprimand their own officeholders. But in many ways it was the culmination of what’s been happening at the state level. State and local parties are increasingly disciplining their officeholders, and it’s mostly happening on the Republican side.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s typical for the losing party in a presidential race to undergo some sort of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Loss-Democrats-Seth-Masket/dp/1108482120/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2WHSGBSS8GIZI&amp;keywords=Masket&amp;qid=1641421903&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=maske%2Cstripbooks%2C208&amp;sr=1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">period of self-reflection after its loss</a>, trying to come up with a narrative that will help guide it in future elections. But what Republicans have gone through since 2020 is something of a departure, with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/07/republicans-big-lie-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many in the party</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/05/1070362852/trump-big-lie-election-jan-6-families" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguing</a> that former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/perdue-kemp-ga-governor-trump-big-lie/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t actually lose</a>. Moreover, these election deniers haven’t just tried to delegitimize the 2020 election results, they’ve also spearheaded an effort to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/heeding-steve-bannons-call-election-deniers-organize-to-seize-control-of-the-gop-and-reshape-americas-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebuke Republicans who have said Trump lost</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the key tools these Trump supporters have used is the censure. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-is-censure-congress-/2021/11/18/20245326-4889-11ec-b8d9-232f4afe4d9b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A censure</a> is something governing bodies (often legislatures) use to issue official statements of condemnation or disapproval. Censures have a long history in this country. The U.S. Senate, for example, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/parties-leadership/censure-president-jackson.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured President Andrew Jackson in 1834</a> for effectively shuttering the Bank of the United States. The Senate has also <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/censure.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured nine of its own members</a>, and in 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Discipline/Expulsion-Censure-Reprimand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured its 24th member</a>, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, for, among other things, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-house-gosar-ocasio-cortez/2021/11/17/4e012bb4-47b9-11ec-b8d9-232f4afe4d9b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting an anime video of himself killing a fellow member</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the censure is, by definition, a symbolic act: It does not actually remove anyone from office or strip anyone of power. In fact, the censure has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-does-it-mean-to-censure-a-politician" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically carried little weight</a>, although it can signal to the officeholder that they are losing standing with their party and that their renomination is likely in jeopardy. And until recently, censures were also relatively rare.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">State parties <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-trumpiest-republicans-are-at-the-state-and-local-levels-not-in-d-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have issued a number of censures</a> since the beginning of 2021. Take Arizona, a state that has made headlines for its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/post-election-audits-are-normal-whats-happening-in-arizona-is-anything-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frivolous investigations into the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election</a>. In early 2021, Republicans in the state <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/23/politics/arizona-gop-censure-mccain-flake-ducey/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured three Republicans</a> for, among other things, failing to support Trump: former Sen. Jeff Flake, Gov. Doug Ducey and Cindy McCain, the widow of the late Sen. John McCain. Democrats in the state haven’t been as quick to censure as Republicans, but in January 2022, the Arizona Democratic Party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/us/politics/sinema-censure-arizona-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured Sen. Kyrsten Sinema</a> for her refusal to change filibuster rules in order to pass voting rights measures. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just state parties, either. Censures aren’t as well documented at the county level, as  there are more than 3,000 counties in the U.S. versus just 50 states, but I found in a search of nearly 7,000 newspapers using <a href="https://www.newsbank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NewsBank</a>, a news research database, an explosion of censures, especially in 2021, at the county level.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1210" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/masket.CENSURES.0309-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/masket.CENSURES.0309-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/masket.CENSURES.0309-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/masket.CENSURES.0309-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The pattern is pretty striking. Censures by county parties were until recently a rare event, affecting somewhere between zero and three people per year, I found. Most were issued over relatively modest local or factional party disputes. Republicans in Bexar County, Texas, for example, <a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Straus-censured-by-Bexar-County-GOP-12425417.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured then-state House Speaker Joe Straus</a> for blocking a number of conservative bills in 2017. In Mohave County, Arizona Republicans <a href="https://www.havasunews.com/news/paul-mosley-censured-by-county-gop/article_0a05e526-87f0-11e8-993f-f3735fa604c0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured state Rep. Paul Mosley</a> in 2018 for “conduct unbecoming” after he tried to abuse his position as a state legislator in order to get out of a traffic ticket. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But starting in 2020, the types of censures county parties issued shifted — both censures issued in 2020, for instance, had to do with COVID-19 mask mandates. In 2021, I found, there was just a dramatic increase in county-level censures, especially among Republican county parties. Republican county parties censured 23 GOP officeholders in 2021 compared to Democrats’ five, and what’s more, most Republican censures were tied in some way to the 2020 election, the subsequent Jan. 6 insurrection or the ensuing fallout.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, I have organized the county censure data by the number of individuals censured, which can be tricky. There are only five Democratic censures here, for example, and four of them were actually done in the same resolution, passed by the Democratic Party of Palm Beach County, Florida, to &lt;a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/education/2021/06/04/pbc-dems-censure-school-board-members-over-white-advantage-reversal/7541548002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;chastise four school board members&lt;/a&gt; for removing the phrase “white advantage” from a statement about equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a>Although censures are still relatively rare events — I found just 34 of them in more than 3,000 counties over the past seven years — the uptick in the last year signals a growing form of radicalism among local party committees. All of this points to yet another signal of a Republican Party undergoing a purge. Parties often wage ideological fights in their primary contests, but primaries take time. In this rash of recent censures, we’re seeing county party leaders trying to more emphatically assert which faction of the party is in charge, and as I’ve documented above, that could dramatically reshape the GOP at its most fundamental levels of government</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to fathom what’s happening in Ukraine right now. Schools <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/video/20220306-war-in-ukraine-school-bombed-by-russian-army" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being bombed</a>. Civilians <a href="https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/from-molotov-cocktails-to-anti-tank-barr-idUSRTS62SIY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forming militias and making</a> molotov cocktails. Millions of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60555472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people displaced</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/04/ukraine-russia-casualties-kyiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unknown number</a> of deaths. But perhaps equally difficult to fathom is the fact that, as recently as last month, the man behind this war, Russian president Vladimir Putin, was enjoying his highest approval ratings in nearly four years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In February, Putin <a href="https://www.levada.ru/en/ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a 71 percent approval</a> rating and a 27 percent disapproval rating among the Russian public, the highest it’s been since May 2018 (though it’s never dipped below 59 percent according to the Levada-Center). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, it’s natural to question the accuracy of public opinion polling under an authoritarian regime, but there are actually a number of reasons to believe those approval ratings represent genuine Russian sentiment. For one, the polling comes from the Levada-Center, a respected, independent pollster. And if you’re suspicious that Russians aren’t being totally honest about their feelings with pollsters due to fear of retribution, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1060586X.2016.1144334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research to control for this phenomenon</a> has found this isn’t the case — the polls are capturing true Russian opinions on Putin. Sure, there is likely some bias, but the bottom line is that Putin’s popularity at home is real. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other recent polling suggests that many Russians view the war in Ukraine differently from those in the West. A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/08/russia-public-opinion-ukraine-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted in Russia last week</a> by a group of independent survey research organizations (who have remained anonymous in order to avoid backlash from the Kremlin), found that about 58 percent of Russians approve of the invasion of Ukraine, while 23 percent oppose it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason Russians still support Putin and the war in Ukraine has to do with the propaganda and disinformation being sown by the Kremlin. Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/world/europe/russia-censorship-media-crackdown.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin banned the spreading</a> of “false information” about the war — including calling it a war. He also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-business-europe-germany-d15ca4ed450d9ca67f43d3b1ac27294d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked Facebook and Twitter</a>, as well as a number of Western news outlets including the BBC, making it even harder for Russians to get outside information. And among state-sponsored media in Russia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/world/europe/russia-ukraine-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the war is downplayed and cast</a> as a peacekeeping mission designed to liberate Ukraine from Nazis and drug-addled dictators.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, it’s not surprising that the Russian public has a very different view of the war: When asked <a href="https://www.levada.ru/en/2022/03/04/ukraine-and-donbass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a poll by the Levada-Center</a> in late February who they thought was the initiator of the escalations in Ukraine, 60 percent of Russians said the U.S. and NATO members were to blame — just 3 percent said Russia was the initiator. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there are some realities of the war that can’t be ignored or downplayed, and they impact Russians’ views, too. For instance, as international sanctions place increased pressure on Russia’s financial sector, the ruble, Russia’s official currency, has plummeted, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russians-line-up-at-banks-as-currency-plummets-in-face-of-sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russians have been lining up at banks</a> trying to withdraw cash. As a result, consumer confidence in Russia has taken a hit, dipping to its lowest point this year. On March 2 it dropped to 98.4, a 5.6 percent drop from four days prior, according to Morning Consult’s Russia Index <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/03/russian-consumers-are-feeling-the-impact-of-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of Consumer Sentiment</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also clear from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/06/protest-arrests-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the public protests by Russians against the war</a>, which have resulted in thousands of arrests, that many are not buying the official Kremlin line. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/mar/02/ukrainians-are-our-friends-the-young-russian-anti-war-protesters-defying-putin-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many of those protestors</a> are young Russians, among whom support for the war was lower in the anonymous poll released last week: Among 18- to 24-year-olds, 29 percent supported the war, and 39 percent opposed it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the war rages on, Putin’s popularity may become more precarious, too, if history is any indication. Russians have tended to <a href="https://theconversation.com/putins-public-approval-is-soaring-during-the-russia-ukraine-crisis-but-its-unlikely-to-last-177302" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose faith in Putin</a> when faced with ongoing war, economic uncertainty or public protest against the leader.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“While examining hundreds of thousands of Russian public opinion survey responses from 2003-19, I have found that merely being exposed to public protest depresses approval of Putin and his regime,” Noah Buckley, a political science professor at Trinity College Dublin, wrote in <a href="https://theconversation.com/putins-approval-has-stayed-strong-over-the-years-war-in-ukraine-could-change-that-178179" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent op-ed</a> for The Conversation. “Members of the general public learn about regime misdeeds from these protests, and discover that there are more dissenters in their society than they may have previously assumed. In other ongoing research, my co-authors and I have found that when Russians find out that Putin’s approval levels are not as sky-high as they thought, their own feelings towards him sour substantially.”</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>On Tuesday, President Biden announced <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-ban-russian-oil-imports-energy-products/story?id=83315763">a ban on Russian oil and energy imports</a>, and it turns out that many Americans support this decision, even if this results in higher gas prices. When asked directly if they would support imposing sanctions on Russian oil even if it led to higher fuel prices, <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3838">71 percent</a> of Americans (from a Mar. 4-6 Quinnipiac University poll) and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-08/card/wsj-poll-79-of-americans-back-ban-on-russian-oil-even-if-energy-prices-rise-niT9f6YRH5wRWe4pbhNv">79 percent</a> (from a Mar. 4-7 Wall Street Journal/Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates/ALG Research poll) said yes. When some pollsters included the option to support sanctions but<em> not</em> if they increased oil prices, support for sanctions was less consistently high. Sixty-nine percent of Americans supported sanctions even if they increased U.S. energy prices, and 12 percent supported sanctions as long as they <em>didn’t</em> increase prices, according to <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202203010901.pdf">a Mar. 1-2 poll</a> from Marist College/NPR/PBS NewsHour. However, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/nnyqh3ib1d/econToplines.pdf">a Mar. 5-8 The Economist/YouGov poll</a> of Americans found much lower support (46 percent supported sanctions regardless of their effect on U.S. gas prices, but 27 percent supported sanctions only if they didn’t raise prices) as did a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/07/russian-oil-embargo-polling-ukraine-crisis/">Mar. 5-7 Morning Consult poll</a> of registered voters (49 percent supported sanctions regardless of their effect on U.S. gas prices, but 28 percent supported sanctions only if they didn’t raise prices).</li><li>A plurality of Americans (42 percent) felt that <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/omtmdczu48/econToplines.pdf">parents should have the final say</a> over whether K-12 students are required to wear masks in school, according to a Feb. 26-Mar. 1 poll from The Economist/YouGov. Twenty-two percent said it should be up to school administrators, 14 percent were unsure and 13 percent said the government, while just 7 percent said this responsibility should fall to teachers.</li><li><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/lat-mlb-lockout/">The Major League Baseball lockout is dampening interest</a> in the season among baseball fans, though most aren’t following the dispute closely, according to a Mar. 3-7 poll from the Los Angeles Times/SurveyMonkey. Sixty percent of fans said the dispute had caused them to lose interest in the season, but 78 percent said they weren’t closely following the lockout. In terms of who to blame for the dispute, baseball fans were split between blaming the lockout on both the players and the owners (49 percent) and blaming just the owners (31 percent).</li><li>Over three-quarters of European women<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined as women aged 15 and older who live in one of the 27 member countries of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> thought that <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-03/Women_in_times_of_Covid19_2022_ep_eb_fl_report_en.pdf">the COVID-19 pandemic had led to at least a small increase of violence against women</a> in their country, according to a Jan. 25-Feb. 3 poll from Ipsos European Public Affairs, commissioned by the European Parliament. Women from Greece (93 percent) and Portugal (90 percent) were the most likely to say the pandemic had increased violence against women in their country, while less than half of Finnish (48 percent) and Hungarian (47 percent) women said the same.</li><li>Though it’s hardly a resounding vote of confidence, Americans seem to be giving <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-will-americans-grade-bidens-handling-of-the-crisis-in-ukraine/">Biden better marks for how he is handling the crisis in Ukraine</a>. According to the aforementioned Marist College/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll from Mar. 1-2, 52 percent now said they approved of Biden’s leadership in Ukraine, versus <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-the-biden-administration-heading-into-the-state-of-the-union-address-february-2022/">34 percent in a Feb. 15-21 poll</a>. Polls from Morning Consult/Politico showed a similar but less pronounced trend: A Mar. 4-6 poll found <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/08161506/2203034_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf">47 percent of registered voters approved of Biden’s handling of the crisis in Ukraine</a>, versus <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/22150612/2202139_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf">40 percent from Feb. 19-21</a>.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">As the war in Ukraine enters its third week, the threat of a nuclear conflict hangs in the balance. NATO has said it will not send troops to Ukraine or, despite repeated calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, enforce a no-fly zone over the country. Doing so, NATO says, risks escalating the situation to a direct conflict between nuclear powers. </p>
