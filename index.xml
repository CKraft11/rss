			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">It might be an off-year election cycle in the U.S., but September has been full of high-profile elections. First we had the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California recall election</a>, then <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-things-to-watch-in-canadas-big-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada’s parliamentary election</a> this past Monday. And on Sunday, Germany will go to the polls to decide the makeup of its parliament’s lower chamber, the Bundestag. Those results will determine who leads Germany’s government, and importantly, that individual won’t be long-time Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is stepping down after nearly 16 years in charge.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race to replace Merkel <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-why-many-voters-are-still-undecided/a-59251080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be very uncertain</a>, too, because <a href="https://zweitstimme.org/en/posts/forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no one party looks likely</a> to win a large plurality of seats, much less a majority. That means the next government, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/a-history-of-germanys-coalition-governments/g-41818483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like every one in Germany since World War II</a>, will likely be a coalition of at least two parties — and quite possibly a third. And while the leader of the party that wins the most seats often ends up as chancellor, that’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/10/06/schmidt-is-big-victor-in-balloting/939e74c6-f180-47d4-a8d5-d2a969850ab7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not always the case</a>. In all likelihood, though, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56821462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next chancellor</a> will come from <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/cdu-csu-spd-afd-fdp-left-greens/a-38085900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Germany’s two major parties</a>: either the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) helmed by Olaf Scholz, or Merkel’s party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), now led by Armin Laschet. However, there is a small chance that Annalena Baerbock of The Greens, a left-leaning, environmentally conscious party, could also lead the next government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most <a href="https://pollytix.eu/pollytix-german-election-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling averages</a> show <a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2021-08/sonntagsfrage-bundestagswahl-2021-bundeskanzler-koalition-umfragen?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tight race</a> with a <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly fragmented vote</a> across <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany’s seven notable parties</a>. The SPD has been on the rise since late July and now leads in the polls with just around 25 percent, thanks in part to Scholz’s status as the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aT2f8yc8p9-XjOqFCTQ1nDeP5GEORu9QZDOtUwF8smI/edit#gid=1579897364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular choice</a> among German voters to be the next chancellor. Next up is the CDU and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU),<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/where-do-they-stand-a-quick-guide-to-germany-s-political-parties-a-651388.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The CSU&lt;/a&gt; operates only in the state of Bavaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> which together have seen their polling numbers fall into the low 20s as Laschet has <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/conservative-laschet-struggles-momentum-german-121328724.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received negative reviews</a> for his performance in debates and on the campaign trail. The Greens, who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/germanys-greens-were-riding-high-in-the-polls-but-fell-from-grace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held a small lead in the polls back in the spring</a>, are now at around 15 percent. Three other parties are polling above the 5 percent threshold necessary to make it into the Bundestag (more on that cut-off later), although only two are potential coalition partners: The <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/classical_liberalism.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classically liberal</a> Free Democratic Party (FDP) is polling at about 11 percent, while the left-wing and aptly named The Left Party is polling at about 6 percent. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-far-right-afd-alternative-for-germany-2021-election-results/a-57054532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The far-right and xenophobic</a> Alternative for Germany (AfD) is actually polling higher than The Left at around 11 percent, but Germany’s other parties <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-real-choice-on-election-day-jamaica-kenya-or-mickey-mouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have ruled out</a> forming <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cordon_sanitaire_(politics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a governing coalition with the AfD</a> because of its extreme views.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Yet there’s reason to be a tad worried about the state of the polls in Germany. The Washington Post’s Lenny Bronner <a href="https://twitter.com/lennybronner/status/1438940392758652932?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently found</a> there’s a strong likelihood pollsters are “herding,” which is the tendency for pollsters to produce results that are too similar to one another. Bronner noticed that the shares the SPD and AfD have received in polls are <em>very</em> consistent across pollsters — in fact, in all likelihood <em>too</em> consistent. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-some-pollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we’ve found at FiveThirtyEight</a>, herding can be especially common at the end of the campaign, perhaps because pollsters are afraid of producing outliers that go against the rest of the field. But the unfortunate upshot is that herding often leads pollsters to underestimate some parties’ support and, in turn, leads election forecasters to underestimate the uncertainty in the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even with this concern, however, there is clearly no party flying high in the polls, which makes it difficult to say with any certainty what the eventual governing coalition will look like in Germany. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/jamaica-traffic-lights-or-kiwis-germanys-coalition-conundrum-2021-09-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germans like to name potential governing coalitions</a> after things that <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2021-governing-coalition-options/g-59031537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match the colors of their respective parties</a>, so bearing that in mind, the two most likely coalitions at this point are probably a left-leaning “traffic light” government formed by the SPD (which uses red as its color), the FDP (yellow) and The Greens (no explanation needed), or a right-leaning “Jamaica” government formed by the CDU/CSU (black), the FDP and the Greens. However, each of those coalitions would include a party that doesn’t comfortably align ideologically — the FDP in the former, The Greens in the latter — which could complicate coalition negotiations. In 2017, for instance, efforts to put together a “Jamaica” coalition <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-preliminary-coalition-talks-collapse-after-fdp-walks-out/a-41445987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell apart</a>. And while the business-friendly FDP could join a “traffic light” coalition, FDP leader Christian Lindner has said he wants <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/23/germany-election-chancellor-laschet-scholz-lindner-global-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control over the finance ministry</a> in exchange for helping Scholz become chancellor, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/we-want-increase-investment-germany-fdp-leader-says-2021-09-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be a hurdle</a> for the SPD and The Greens since having the FDP in that position could limit how much they can <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-19/germany-s-scholz-lays-down-rules-for-any-future-coalition-ally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise taxes</a> and expand deficit spending.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why other coalition options could come into play, including an “R2G” (red, red, green) coalition made up of the SPD, The Left and The Greens. In the final days of the campaign, Merkel <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-election-2021-red-scare-angela-merkel-cdu-armin-laschet-spd-olaf-scholz-greens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has voiced fears about the possibility of a left-wing government</a>, arguing it would turn the country away from the moderate course she’s pursued over the past decade and a half. And The Left does have some views that could make an all-left coalition untenable, including a <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-left-party-plans-to-scrap-nato-end-troop-deployments/a-57973017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desire to leave NATO</a> and a lingering connection to old Communist East Germany. Some additional coalitions include a “Germany” coalition of the CDU/CSU, SPD and FDP or a larger “Kenya” coalition of the CDU/CSU, SPD and The Greens. There could even be a renewal of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-election/german-spd-aims-for-post-merkel-government-without-her-conservatives-idUSKBN2B70WV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current “grand coalition” government of the CDU/CSU and SPD</a>, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But OK, that’s <em>a lot</em> of potential coalitions. Let’s talk about how the German electoral system works — as that’s why so many different coalitions are possible. Elections for the Bundestag <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/48997/1/311685250.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combine the principles</a> of proportional and district-level representation, so <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/parliament/elections/arithmetic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germans actually cast two votes</a> at the ballot box: one for a local candidate and one for a party, which allows voters to potentially split their ticket between parties. The first vote functions similarly to most elections in the U.S.: The candidate with the most votes in each of Germany’s 299 single-member districts wins the seat. But the second vote is more important, as it determines the proportional share of seats each party will have in the Bundestag once all is said and done. The 299 district-level members are joined <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/23/how-do-germanys-elections-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by at least another 299 members elected from a ranked list of candidates</a> submitted by each party ahead of the election, with each party gaining whatever number of candidates from the party list it needs to reach its proportional share of seats based on the second vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as mentioned earlier, a party must win at least 5 percent of the party-preference vote, or win at least three single-member districts, to gain proportional representation in the Bundestag.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, a party can win one or two single-member seats to make it into parliament, but it would not be eligible to gain proportional representation based on its party-preference vote share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> However, there is one last wrinkle in Germany’s electoral system: It is possible for a party to win more single-members seats than it is entitled to based on its party-preference vote. When this happens, the Bundestag expands beyond its 598 seats by adding even more members from party lists to ensure each party’s seat total aligns with its party-preference vote share. After the 2017 election, for instance, the Bundestag ended up with 709 total seats, 111 more than its base number, and some projections suggest the Bundestag <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-real-choice-on-election-day-jamaica-kenya-or-mickey-mouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be even larger after the 2021 election</a> to ensure proportionality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into Sunday, it looks like an unpredictable race, with perhaps an even more uncertain coalition-building process to follow. But one thing is certain: This election will mark the end of a distinct era in German and European politics. That’s because Merkel, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/business/merkel-economy-germany-elections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longtime force of stability and leadership</a> in her country, and for the European Union more broadly, is exiting the stage. Merkel, who was sometimes called “<a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/politico50/angela-merkel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leader of the free world</a>” during Donald Trump’s presidency because of his isolationist bent, was the <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/angela-merkel-becomes-chancellor-of-germany" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first woman</a> to serve as Germany’s chancellor, and she <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-angela-merkel-becomes-second-longest-serving-chancellor/a-51773216" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranks high among the country’s longest-serving leaders</a>. Whoever has the job next will have big shoes to fill.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/supreme-court-sets-arguments-big-abortion-case-80131153">announced on Monday</a> that it will hear a case in December concerning a Mississippi abortion law that challenges Roe v. Wade. Mississippi’s 2018 law bans most abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy<em>. </em>This case comes as most Americans (62 percent) want the court to leave the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision<em> </em>as is, per a recent <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_092021/">Monmouth University poll</a>. The Mississippi law isn’t the only high-profile law to challenge the right to abortion, either. Earlier in September, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/">the nation’s most restrictive abortion law</a> went into effect in Texas after the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 vote declining to pause the law while lower courts continue to rule on its constitutionality. Overall, Americans’ disapproval rating of the Supreme Court’s performance (45 percent) is only 3 percentage points higher than approval of the court (42 percent).</li><li>Favorability of the United States has fallen in France after Australia pulled out of a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/19/1038746061/submarine-deal-us-uk-australia-france">$66 billion submarine deal</a>. Australia canceled this contract with France in favor of partnering with the United States and the United Kingdom instead. Upset by this deal, France withdrew its ambassadors from the U.S. and Australia. And, per a recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/20/france-us-favorability-submarine-polling/">Morning Consult poll</a>, favorable views of the U.S. have since slipped in France from 49 percent to 44 percent. However, U.S. popularity among Australians has increased by 2 points with 51 percent of Australians now viewing the U.S. favorably, according to the same poll.</li><li>President Biden announced on Wednesday that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-general-assembly-joe-biden-pandemics-business-united-nations-e7c09c1f896d83c0ed80513082787bd3">the U.S. is doubling its purchase of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines</a> to donate to lower-income countries. Forty-nine percent of Americans say that providing COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries is important (although not a top priority), per a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/09/15/majority-in-u-s-says-public-health-benefits-of-covid-19-restrictions-worth-the-costs-even-as-large-shares-also-see-downsides/#few-americans-know-access-to-vaccines-is-limited-in-developing-countries">Pew Research Center poll</a>. Meanwhile, the Biden administration also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/health/cdc-booster-panel.html">wants to roll out Pfizer booster shots for U.S. adults</a>, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-203d8c288858e815175880753cbc9b8f">only high risk adults and those over 65 receive a third dose</a>. This has been tricky for the Biden administration to navigate as only <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL">32 percent</a> of the world is fully vaccinated, but most vaccinated Americans (62 percent) say they would get a booster shot if recommended, according to Pew.</li><li><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/officials-haitian-migrants-released-us-80163717">Thousands of Haitian migrants</a> are trying to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. Many <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/21/what-led-haitian-nationals-migrating-u-s-southern-border/8419170002/">fled to Central and South America</a> after an earthquake in 2010 and are now leaving due to a lack of jobs, but say they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-mexico-texas-caribbean-immigration-56f1f0093039e2a43e128b7ef0015485">don’t feel safe</a> returning to Haiti. Since that disaster, in 2021 alone, a magnitude <a href="https://apnews.com/article/haiti-earthquake-98f06a322e12f732f94485238d13558c">7.2 earthquake struck the southwestern part of the nation</a>, and the country’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/americas/haiti-explainer-jovenel-moise-assassination-cmd-intl/index.html">president was assassinated</a>. Per a recent <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/52_rate_biden_poor_on_immigration">Rasmussen survey</a>, 52 percent of likely U.S. voters think Biden’s response to immigration issues has been poor. Moreover, a majority of voters across the political spectrum — 84 percent of Republicans, 57 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of voters not affiliated with either party — deemed the current immigration situation at the southern U.S. border a crisis. Many respondents (54 percent) blame Biden administration policies for current immigration problems, while only 37 percent place blame on Trump-era policies.</li><li>On Tuesday, world leaders gathered for the start of the high-level week at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Pressing issues on the agenda included <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-general-assembly-health-china-coronavirus-pandemic-africa-3284c8ff8739dd7cfaf78db214098403">climate change, the pandemic and the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/17/many-people-globally-see-united-nations-in-a-positive-light-including-its-handling-of-climate-change/?utm_content=buffer37fea&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Pew poll</a>, most Americans (59 percent) see the U.N. in a favorable light. Europeans are also largely upbeat on the U.N., with majorities across all nine of the European countries polled feeling favorable toward the organization. Additionally, the U.N.’s response to climate change is mostly favorable around the world. A median of 56 percent of people across the 17 countries surveyed thought the U.N. was doing a good job handling climate change.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Last Tuesday’s gubernatorial recall election in California was the campaign that launched a thousand takes: It was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/us/politics/midterms-california-republicans-newsom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good sign for Democrats in 2022</a>; it was a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/18/politics/biden-california-democrats-midterms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good sign for Republicans in 2022</a>. But we at FiveThirtyEight urge far more caution before taking away any national lessons from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s <a href="https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/governor-recall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">victory</a>. To be sure, Newsom’s win was decisive, and with 89 percent of the votes now counted,<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 5:15 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> we can dive a little more into what the results mean. But what they mean is very much up for interpretation — if they mean anything at all. After all, this was just one election and it was conducted under unusual circumstances to boot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One thing we do know is that turnout was <em>really</em> high: More than 13 million people voted.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;a href="https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/status" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;11,690,999&lt;/a&gt; counted ballots, the state estimates there are &lt;a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/statewide-elections/2021-recall/unprocessed-ballot-report.pdf?_ga=2.118328845.504203093.1632146635-284206121.1619718311" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1,381,036&lt;/a&gt; still remaining to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a> That means more than 50 percent of California’s <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2020g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 million eligible voters</a> cast a ballot — a remarkably high turnout rate for an off-year election. In fact, it’s higher than the 49 percent turnout in California’s regularly scheduled 2018 gubernatorial election, which was a <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically high-turnout midterm</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that this eye-popping figure means the high level of interest voters had in the previous two elections (the 2020 election had the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest turnout</a> for a presidential election in over a century) is here to stay. But there are also other possible explanations for the recall’s high turnout. First, under a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-extends-mail-ballots-for-all-voters-15964937.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pandemic-inspired voting law</a>, every registered voter was automatically mailed a ballot — a reform that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/letting-people-vote-at-home-increases-voter-turnout-heres-proof/2018/01/26/d637b9d2-017a-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political scientists say</a> can <a href="https://voteathome.org/research/all-mail-voting-in-colorado-increases-turnout-and-reduces-turnout-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly increase turnout</a>. Second, recall elections may inherently generate a lot of voter interest (which makes sense, given that there needs to be strong grassroots passion on at least one side to force a recall in the first place). In two of the three previous gubernatorial recall elections in U.S. history, turnout was higher than in the respective state’s previous gubernatorial election, though this is admittedly a very small sample size.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The second thing we know about this year’s California recall is that the polls were off by quite a bit. The <a href="https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/governor-recall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recall is currently failing</a> by 26 percentage points (63 percent to 37 percent), and while that margin may tighten a tad more given the <a href="https://twitter.com/sovernnation/status/1440417030461480961?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slight Republican trend in the count</a>, it still marks a substantially more pro-Newsom result than <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/california-recall-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s final recall polling average</a>, which gave keeping Newsom in office a 16-point lead. This 10-point miss was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about twice the size</a> of the average polling error in gubernatorial elections dating back to 1998, and more than twice the size of the polling error in the 2020 presidential election, when Biden led by 8.4 points in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s final polling average</a> but <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won by 4.5 points</a>. Notably, too, unlike the national polls in the 2020 presidential election, the polls in California were biased toward <em>Republicans</em> and not Democrats, which fits into a pattern where polls in very blue states have at times underestimated Democratic performance, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly in the 2016 presidential election</a>. As we’ve noted previously, it’s hard to predict the direction of polling errors because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-updated-our-pollster-ratings-ahead-of-the-2020-general-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their movement is inconsistent</a> from year to year — something to remember in 2022 and 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, we see <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/why-a-troubled-polling-industry-whiffed-on-california-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two broad, potential explanations</a> for this polling error: the difficulty of polling an unusual race like a recall, and/or late movement in voter engagement. There’s also another, simpler story: that the polls were off all along. Regardless, these explanations may all relate to one other. For one thing, pollsters may have struggled to identify who a “likely” voter was in this election; <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-27/likely-california-voters-now-almost-evenly-split-on-newsom-recall-poll-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some surveys found</a> an unusually large gap between the results for likely voters and all registered voters. California normally holds statewide elections in November of even-numbered years, but this was an election in September of an odd-numbered year. Additionally, because every voter received a ballot in the mail, some voters who did not seem likely to vote could have eventually cast a ballot. In that way, higher turnout may have contributed to the polling miss. The polling average also suggested at least some movement toward Newsom’s position after the polls tightened in early August.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may have partly been due to &lt;a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=36cdcb0b-7cfa-4b55-8704-d1f02a9fe6e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an outlier poll from SurveyUSA&lt;/a&gt; that found the recall vote &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; by 11 points, but even with that poll removed from our polling average, opposition to the recall still would have led by only around 4 points in late August, &lt;a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/newsom-clings-to-lead-in-recall-while-crime-becomes-a-top-issue-for-ca-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;as other&lt;/a&gt; polls &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-vaccinated-say-unvaccinated-add-risk-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;still showed&lt;/a&gt; a fairly &lt;a href="https://gravismarketing.com/california-poll-result-gravis-marketing-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;close contest&lt;/a&gt;. SurveyUSA has &lt;a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=f054d152-ceac-48dc-a422-2f22c7a00521" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;since acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that the wording of their likely voter question “may have led some respondents opposed to the recall to misidentify themselves as being unlikely to vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> It’s possible, then, that a large number of previously unactivated Democratic-leaning Californians could have become engaged and then shown up as likely voters in polls conducted closer to the election, making the late movement not about changing minds about Newsom but about waking up California’s latent Democratic electorate.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Still, despite the polling miss, it would be unfair to cast many aspersions on pollsters. CNN’s Harry Enten <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/03/politics/newsom-rising-polls-recall/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted ahead of the recall</a> that the polling error in the 2003 recall was about 9 points, and the “true” margin of error in polls of recent special elections for the U.S. House (which also occur at odd times of year) <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/01/politics/five-reasons-conor-lamb-could-win/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was around 13 points</a>. Additionally, we perhaps should have expected Newsom to outperform the polls because the status quo — in this case, Newsom staying in office — <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/book/7281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometimes does better</a> than expected in referenda, thanks to a tendency for undecided voters and lower-information voters to vote “no” when faced with a yes-or-no ballot proposition. This is really another reason to be cautious about reading too much into the California result.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also, the degree to which one party overperforms in special elections has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically predicted</a> the national political mood in the next regularly scheduled election, so you <em>could</em> take this recall result to mean that the midterms will be decent for Democrats, or at least better than expected given the tendency of the president’s party to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-that-loses-this-year-could-still-win-a-big-consolation-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose ground in the midterms</a>. But you have to look at the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-special-election-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole body of special elections</a> for that correlation to be reliable. Individual election results can vary due to local factors, and a gubernatorial recall election is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-california-recall-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so unique</a> — almost by definition, some major news controversy must have occurred to even get it on the ballot — that it’s not clear we should read anything national into it. In fact, one way to interpret the result in California is that it was largely in line with the state’s base partisanship. The recall’s 26-point loss was very close to California’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> of D+25.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also hard to draw too many conclusions about what this means for the pandemic’s effect on elections, either. Despite Republican criticism of Newsom’s handling of the pandemic, an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/14/politics/california-recall-exit-polls/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exit poll of recall voters</a><a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As was true in the &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/exit-polls-can-be-misleading-especially-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, we should be more cautious than usual in interpreting these results. Almost a third of the poll’s respondents were surveyed by phone, text or online (not as they exited a polling place), meaning it’s harder to know whether respondents actually voted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a> found that 47 percent thought Newsom’s coronavirus restrictions were about right, while only 3 in 10 voters felt they were too strict. Moreover, a plurality of voters said the pandemic was their most important issue, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2021/exit-polls/california/recall/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81 percent of them</a> voted to retain Newsom. This is telling in that it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/19/politics/republicans-message-covid-2022/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jibes with other evidence</a> that Republicans aren’t winning over many new voters with their resistance to COVID-19 precautions. Yet it’s also inconclusive as an answer to the question of whether the coronavirus issue will help or hurt Democrats in the midterms. Republicans’ strategy of doubling down on their anti-coronavirus-restrictions base may not be effective, but California also isn’t a great bellwether for the rest of the nation. Voters in a state that blue were probably predisposed to approve of Newsom’s coronavirus restrictions; it also helps that California is making it through the pandemic relatively well (its <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccination-progress-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination rate is high</a> and <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/californias-covid-19-case-rate-is-now-the-lowest-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case rate is low</a>). On the other hand, voters may have different preferences if they live in red Kansas, where Democrats are defending a governor’s seat in 2022, or in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, which Democrats would do well to hold if they want to keep control of the U.S. House. Furthermore, Newsom’s lack of a significant overperformance provides little evidence that COVID-19 will help Democrats win over new voters, either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But here’s the thing about the 2022 midterms: Republicans don’t need a significant shift in the electoral environment to flip the House, considering that Democrats hold only a 222-to-213 seat edge there.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes three seats that are &lt;a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Members#Vacancies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;currently vacant&lt;/a&gt; but are safe for either party: two for Democrats and one for Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>10</sup></a> For one thing, the GOP will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control the redistricting process for more districts</a> than Democrats, so new map lines alone could <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/redistricting-in-america-part-eight-a-quick-summation-of-a-long-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide Republicans with enough of an edge</a> before we even consider the electoral environment. Newsom’s 26-point win also contains some potentially ominous signs for Democrats. Take Orange County, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pol-orange-county-gop-house-20181117-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ancestral home of the state’s GOP</a> that is now a key swing suburban county. <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?type=county&amp;year=2020&amp;fips=6059&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2020</a>, Biden won Orange County by 9 points, while opposition to the recall <a href="https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/governor-recall/county/orange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads by about 3 points</a> there. And if we dig into two key, swingy House seats <a href="https://voiceofoc.org/2020/11/republicans-flip-second-oc-congressional-seat-as-young-kim-defeats-gil-cisneros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that Republicans flipped in 2020</a>, we see that “yes” on recall leads relatively narrowly in the Orange County portions of California’s 39th Congressional District (by less than 1 point) and 48th Congressional District (by more than 4 points).<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Monday at 4:51 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> By comparison, Biden performed about 5 to 6 points better in both districts in 2020, carrying <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yr9mcAtuUdNjI9NEPYKxXsEldzzQ2ZaDwEAbnPRyS4/edit#gid=1938542161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Orange County part</a> of the 39th District by about 5 points and the 48th District (entirely in Orange) by about 1.5 points. These small shifts don’t mean Democrats can’t flip those seats back in 2022 — the lines will change to an unknown extent in redistricting, for one thing — but at the very least, it doesn’t suggest that turf is getting friendlier to them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nonetheless, Orange County’s result might also demonstrate Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can still hold onto their edge in the suburbs</a>. Even though “yes” on recall performed better than Trump, this contest marked yet another election where the Republican candidate or the Republican-backed ballot position still lost the huge suburban county — a sign that it probably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/us/california-recall-orange-county.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t return solidly to the GOP fold</a> anytime soon. Conversely, although the recall vote failed by 26 points in <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/imperialcountycalifornia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily Hispanic</a> Imperial County, which is located along the U.S.-Mexico border, such a result still suggests Republicans might be able to hold onto <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the improvements they made among Hispanic voters in 2020</a>. That’s because that result, while positive for Newsom, is similar to Biden’s 24-point edge in 2020, which is a far cry from Hillary Clinton’s nearly 42-point lead there in 2016. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using California’s recall as a dead-certain indicator of the future electoral environment is a dicey proposition. Instead, keep an eye on the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic-ballot polling average</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval rating</a>, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can serve as broader signals</a> of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where things stand</a> as we move forward.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): With Congress fully back in session, Democrats are once again in the business of legislating. This fall, they’re trying to push through a number of ambitious policies, including both the bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill and their ambitious $3.5 trillion (for now) spending plan, which they’ll most likely pass via budget reconciliation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s not all. Democrats have also said they’ll try to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-democrats-move-forward-a-voting-rights-bill-by-making-a-moral-case-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass a bill on voting rights</a> and, in light of the Senate parliamentarian’s decision to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/senate-parliamentarian-sets-back-dems-immigration-push-80117636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclude a pathway for citizenship for immigrants from the upcoming reconciliation bill</a>,  will continue to push on this front, too. And, of course, looming over all this is the possibility of a government shutdown — there are just eight days before the government potentially runs out of money — as well as an impending fight around raising the nation’s debt limit (Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he and Senate Republicans will <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/20/congressional-clash-increasing-debt-limit/5789047001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refuse to raise it</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So we’re taking a step back today to assess just how likely each of these proposals are to pass Congress, what we think might end up in them if they pass and how Americans feel about them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. What do we make of its chances of passing?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/spot-gerrymandering-state-fivethirtyeight-80189920</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/lee-drutman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee Drutman</a>, senior fellow at New America and FiveThirtyEight contributor):<strong> </strong>A $3.5 trillion bill probably has 0 percent chance of passing. A $2.5 trillion bill, on the other hand, has a much better chance of passing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is all part of a negotiation process, some of which is taking place in public, but most of which is taking place in private. Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have said <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/23/sinema-35t-spending-bill-506583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they can’t vote</a> for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/joe-manchin-democratic-bill-3-trillion-climate-provisions/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bill this big</a>. But there’s still plenty of room to trim, and Manchin and Sinema and other moderates can say they got a victory if they reduce it. The fact is $3.5 trillion has an anchoring effect that makes $2.5 or $2 trillion seem reasonable. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a classic bargaining strategy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter):<strong> </strong>I agree with Lee. I feel like it will pass, but I’m <em>almost certain</em> it won’t cost $3.5 trillion. I say that because, once again, it seems like progressive and moderate Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/progressives-democrats-budget.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are at an impasse</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/manchin-i-could-not-support-3-5-trillion-in-spending-120688197914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about the price tag associated with the bill</a> and members are essentially talking past each other. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reason why I think it still passes, though, is because it’d be a pretty humiliating defeat for President Biden if it didn’t. I know there are a lot of threats being thrown around from both progressive and moderate Democrats, but I want to think that the glue holding everyone together is that no one wants to harbor blame for tanking Biden’s agenda — and there’s a lot on the line here. So it’s likely not everyone is going to be happy, but maybe out of a shared sense of not wanting everything to fail, Democrats will find a way to figure this out?</p>

				What California’s Recall Election Can — And Can’t — Tell Us About The 2022 Midterms <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/?cid=_inlinerelated">Read more. »</a>

</div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): Agreed. Manchin — who, of course, is one of the crucial moderate swing votes that Democrats need to convince in order to pass their agenda — has said that $3.5 trillion is too much and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/manchin-pelosi-biden-3-5-trillion-reconciliation-government-spending-debt-deficit-inflation-11630605657" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has called for a “pause” on the legislation</a> (presumably so it can be pared down to a number he feels better about). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The flip side of this, though, is that some progressives — such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal — have said <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewSolender/status/1440092700804530178?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they won’t vote for anything smaller than $3.5 trillion</a>. Their preference is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-democrats-3-5-trillion-reconciliation-bill-face-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closer to $6 trillion</a>, so they already see the $3.5 trillion number as a compromise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So the question is, who blinks first? And if no one blinks, there goes Biden’s signature domestic legislation. For that reason, I agree with Alex<strong> </strong>that the Democrats will figure out a way to make it work.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Yeah, considering <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how underwater Biden’s approval rating is now</a>, I think there’s a need for the Democrats to succeed in passing this, showing they can be effective leaders. </p>



<figure><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-1.png"></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Right, because to Alex’s original point — no Democrat wants to be responsible for sinking this, moderate or progressive. So it seems as if we have consensus here — you all think some version of this bill will pass eventually, just not necessarily at its current price tag.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Do we have a sense yet for what will actually make it into this bill? And whether some proposals are more popular than others?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I think the things that get cut are the things that the moderates will want to fight for. For instance, if Sinema <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/19/kyrsten-sinema-biden-drug-pricing-prescription-plan-512907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposes pricing reforms to prescription drugs</a> and wants to make that a key issue, it’s likely that it will be struck from the reconciliation bill.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m using <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/views-on-the-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July AP-NORC survey</a> to answer to your second question, Sarah, but it seems like while things like funding for roads, bridges and ports are pretty popular, some additional things that might be tackled in Democrats’ solo bill weren’t quite as popular — especially among Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While about two-thirds of Americans surveyed (67 percent) said they support funding for affordable housing, just 41 percent of Republicans do, compared to 85 percent of Democrats. There is also a pretty large gap in support for free community college tuition, with 27 percent of Republicans in favor versus 76 percent of Democrats. And of the 12 topics AP-NORC asked about, both Republicans and Democrats were least in favor of things like funding for electric vehicle charging stations (23 percent and 64 percent, respectively) and funding for passenger and freight rail services (37 percent and 68 percent). </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I’m not sure that what is popular with the public is going to determine what stays and what goes, though. To Lee’s point, it’s all about what’s palatable to these moderate senators. And sometimes, they are reluctant to pass things — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-some-senate-democrats-voted-against-raising-the-minimum-wage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like a higher minimum wage</a> — that are nevertheless broadly popular with the public. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s interesting to think about why that is: Are they misreading the electorate? Are they trying to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/09/pharmaceutical-industry-backs-democratic-holdouts-on-drug-pricing-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">satisfy their donors</a>? Do they just genuinely oppose liberal fiscal policy?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> But as Democrats jockey back and forth on this party-line reconciliation bill, does that put their bipartisan infrastructure bill in jeopardy at all? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Asking because the bipartisan bill actually passed the Senate in August, but Democrats in the House won’t vote on it until this other bill is ready, although as we saw with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderates in the House</a>, appetite for this strategy might be waning among some Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes, that bill is in danger too — and we’ll have an answer pretty soon. House Democratic leaders have said they will put the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2021/09/21/sinema-house-mods-get-their-way-494417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a vote on Sept. 27</a> — contrary to the wishes of progressives who didn’t want to vote on it until after the $3.5 trillion bill was resolved. The question now is whether progressives follow through with <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1440027969154478087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their threats to vote against the infrastructure bill</a> if they don’t get their way. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I agree that the infrastructure bill is probably in danger now, too, because as Nathaniel said earlier, a lot of this comes down to who blinks first. And it seems like the biggest bargaining chip progressive Democrats have right now is threatening to tank the infrastructure bill.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> If you look at <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how often House Democrats have voted in line with Biden’s position</a> so far this year, all but one Democrat has done so at least 89 percent of the time. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="714" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.16.22-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.16.22-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.16.22-PM.png?w=590 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.16.22-PM.png?w=1180 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That’s why I think if push comes to shove, even progressive Democrats will hold their nose and vote for the infrastructure bill. House leadership probably wouldn’t be holding this vote next week if they didn’t believe it would pass.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maybe a few progressives will vote against it out of protest, but I bet it will be just few enough that the bill still passes (perhaps with the support of a few moderate Republicans too?).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I agree with Nathaniel. Progressives have actually moved the needle quite a bit, and my guess is they understand that. A lot of this is about positioning for the future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Progressives will vote against it only if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn’t need their votes. It’s also possible multiple votes fail before a deal is reached.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> It’s also possible the government runs out of money … throwing any talk of passing either this infrastructure bill or the other one on the backburner, no?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As I said at the outset, there are just eight days before the government potentially runs out of money — and Republicans don’t seem likely to pass <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-dare-gop-vote-government-funding-bill/story?id=80146918" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ short-term government funding bill</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What are the risks Democrats face with the possibility of the government running out of money and Republicans also refusing to raise the nation’s debt limit? Does this potentially undermine Democrats’ larger legislative goals?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/gop-critics-trumps-big-lie-struggling-win-reelection-80138507</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I think a government shutdown is quite likely. I would guess both sides see it in their interest because it sharpens the differences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Really, Lee? That’s interesting. I feel like a government shutdown with Democrats in full control of the federal government would be quite embarrassing for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yeah … it certainly didn’t go well for former President Donald Trump and Republicans in 2019 when <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/government-shutdown-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they played the government shutdown game</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Exactly, Sarah. And during that shutdown — and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/heres-happened-time-government-shut/story?id=26997023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the one in 2013</a> — Democrats presented themselves as the responsible, anti-shutdown party. It would be quite the 180 for them to now allow one. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>But there’s the short-term and the long-term aspect. The 2022 midterms are still a ways off, and the Republican strategy is to obstruct, obstruct, obstruct, and make Biden seem like a failure, while the Democratic leadership’s strategy is to get the moderates to see that Republicans are unwilling to compromise — maybe even convincing moderates to agree to get rid of the filibuster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I think McConnell is trying to triangulate here — that is, show just enough willingness to compromise so as not to provoke Manchin and Sinema into abolishing the filibuster — but not so much as to actually help Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Wow. That seems like a very high-risk, high-reward strategy. Do you think the demise of the filibuster is really that important to institutionalist Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Pelosi? And for that matter, what about Biden, who still (publicly, at least) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/07/21/us/politics-biden-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposes ending the filibuster</a>? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m super, super skeptical, since there’s never been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/filibuster-vote-count/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread support among Democratic lawmakers</a>, let alone <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_042921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the public, to end the filibuster</a>. Late last month, we found that public attitudes on filibuster reform <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-democrats-move-forward-a-voting-rights-bill-by-making-a-moral-case-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely budged</a> even when voting rights were on the line, so I’m not super confident there’s an appetite for reforming it for any of Democrats’ other priorities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>It’s all part of the long game, though. If Biden is going to abolish the filibuster — or at least reform it — it has to be at the end of a process where he can say he’s changed his mind because of Republican obstructionism. Same for Manchin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The one thing I find interesting around the impending fight over government funding is that this crisis over the government spending too much money isn’t new. In fact, Republicans racked up a significant amount of spending debt under the Trump administration — America’s debt rose by almost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/14/trump-legacy-national-debt-increasee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$7.8 trillion during Trump’s presidency</a>. But as FiveThirtyEight contributor Dan Cox wrote earlier this year, it’s possible voters won’t factor that into the current fight over the debt ceiling and will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-push-for-big-government-solutions-is-popular-now-but-it-could-backfire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instead blame Biden/Democrats for big spending proposals</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why it seems as if the fight over the debt limit comes at an especially difficult time for Democrats. Do we know how Americans feel about government spending now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Americans are happy to spend lots of money on things they want. Quinnipiac found that <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">62 percent of Americans</a> favored the $3.5 trillion spending bill on social programs such as child care, education and Medicare expansion. That poll notably mentioned the price tag, which not every poll asking about the budget bill does. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>And it doesn’t seem like the price tag of the bill is turning off voters the same way it is for moderate Democrats. An August HuffPost/Data for Progress survey, which tested three hypothetical spending amounts, found that <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/8/dfp-reconciliation-bill-size.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support — regardless of the price tag — was almost the same</a>. Over 60 percent of respondents in each group said they supported the proposal by about a 2-to-1 margin regardless of whether pollsters said the bill would cost $1.5 trillion, $2.5 trillion or $3.5 trillion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>For Democrats, I think the far more consequential bill for the midterms and for the 2024 presidential election is their latest attempt to pass sweeping voting rights legislation, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/14/1036812609/senate-democrats-offer-a-new-voting-bill-but-a-gop-filibuster-likely-blocks-the-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Freedom to Vote Act</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’m just not convinced government spending is going to move many voters in the midterms. Republicans are going to accuse Democrats of spending too much money no matter what.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’re at a very strange point in our politics in which the connection between policy and election outcomes is very tiny. The fundamentals have always been more important than policy, but now <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-dont-fear-an-electoral-backlash-for-opposing-really-popular-parts-of-bidens-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s true more than ever before</a>, given just how few voters are changing their minds. For instance, despite all that happened between 2016 and 2020, the 2020 presidential election saw the <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/how-donald-trump-turned-off-swing-voters-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smallest share of voters who changed which major party they voted for</a>, going back to at least the 1948 and 1952 presidential elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Lee brought up one of Democrats’ other big priorities this fall: passing a voting rights bill. Alex, Nathaniel, you’ve both <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered this issue</a> a lot <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-states-where-efforts-to-restrict-voting-are-escalating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for FiveThirtyEight</a> — what do you think the odds are that Democrats are going to be able to get something through Congress?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I don’t think a voting-rights bill will pass. Even the Freedom to Vote Act — which is essentially a compromise version of H.R. 1, the For the People Act, with controversial provisions like public financing for campaigns removed or reduced — was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/revised-democratic-voting-bill-drops-controversial-provisions-tweaks-others-as-pressure-for-action-mounts/2021/09/14/6c59def8-150a-11ec-9589-31ac3173c2e5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met with a cool reception from Senate Republicans</a>. Even moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins still felt like the bill was too much of a federal takeover of state election administration. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So to me, it just keeps coming back to the question of ending or circumventing the filibuster. While it’s not impossible that Democrats could, say, create a voting-rights exemption from the filibuster in order to pass this bill, I don’t think it’s likely. Manchin and Sinema’s opposition <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/manchin-filibuster-biden/2021/04/07/03635ab2-97fd-11eb-b28d-bfa7bb5cb2a5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seems firm</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Slim to none, if I’m being honest … The Guardian <a href="https://twitter.com/hugolowell/status/1440062265495986176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported earlier this week</a> that the Freedom to Vote Act likely won’t move this week as Manchin is looking to shore up Republican support. But getting Republicans on board with any voting rights legislation is highly unlikely, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-democrats-move-forward-a-voting-rights-bill-by-making-a-moral-case-for-it/">as we’ve said before</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I’m more bullish on the Freedom to Vote Act — I give it a 50-50 shot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Why, Lee?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>Democrats see this as a priority. Although, of course, part of this is a performance again. That is, Manchin has to make a very public showing of trying to get Republicans on board and he has to fail.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the dangers of a contested 2024 election are becoming more real to Democrats as Republicans continue to push <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baseless claims of election fraud</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass restrictive voting laws in the process</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bottom line is Biden is going to come under tremendous pressure to intervene. Democratic activists are just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/biden-voting-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely fired up about passing a voting rights bill</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’ll admit that at one point I thought Manchin would support ending the filibuster to pass a voting bill, but now I feel less confident about that, namely because he said in April that he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joe-manchin-filibuster-vote/2021/04/07/cdbd53c6-97da-11eb-a6d0-13d207aadb78_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I can’t tell which is more plausible: Democrats ending the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation or 10 Republican senators signing onto the newest bill.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Ooh, good question, Alex.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>Alex<strong> </strong>— I would say the first. The second has a 0 percent chance of happening.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I would say neither. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="😭"> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I agree with Lee that this particular bill definitely won’t get 10 Republican votes. But I’d be curious what would happen if Democrats tried to pass, say, a stand-alone gerrymandering ban.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Plus, Republicans and Democrats have different approaches to voting rights legislation, and polls do a fairly good job of capturing that. According to <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/06/09050746/210636_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Morning Consult/Politico survey</a> from June, Democrats (70 percent) are way more likely than Republicans (32 percent) to think restricting voting access is a major threat to American democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Right, Alex — Republicans just fundamentally see voting differently from how Democrats see it. According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/22/wide-partisan-divide-on-whether-voting-is-a-fundamental-right-or-a-privilege-with-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center poll</a> from July, 78 percent of Democrats feel that voting is a “fundamental right for every U.S. citizen and should not be restricted.” But 67 percent of Republicans believe that voting is a “privilege that comes with responsibilities and can be limited.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, so it doesn’t seem as if there is consensus among you all on whether Democrats will be able to get a voting rights bill through Congress. What about immigration reform and passing a pathway to citizenship, now that the Senate budget parliamentarian has said that can’t be included in the upcoming reconciliation bill? Is that even less likely to pass Congress than the voting rights bill?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I would say immigration reform is dead for now. It’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-became-stuck-on-immigration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a great issue for Democrats</a>, especially going into the midterms, and it’s certainly not the issue that 50 Democrats are going to abolish the filibuster for.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I think it’ll happen eventually, Sarah, but I’m also not sure anything will happen imminently here either because it doesn’t seem like Democrats had a concrete Plan B after the Senate parliamentarian ruled against their efforts to include immigration reform in the spending bill?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ve read reports that Schumer and other Democrats want to <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/senate-parliamentarian-sets-back-dems-001909237.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold additional meetings with the parliamentarian</a> to find alternative ways to include citizenship opportunities. But since there’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/20/senate-parliamentarian-rules-on-immigration-in-democratic-budget-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably not enough Republican support</a> to pass an immigration bill without using the reconciliation process, I think the odds are stacked against Democrats on this one, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I think it has a better chance than voting rights legislation, though, if only because there’s still a <em>chance</em> it could pass via reconciliation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also worth noting that creating a path to citizenship for many immigrants is quite popular with the public. In an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/20/998248764/despite-concerns-about-border-poll-finds-support-for-more-pathways-to-citizenshi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR/Ipsos poll</a> from May, 66 percent said they supported it for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, and 70 percent supported it for immigrants with temporary protected status.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, we’ve covered a lot of ground regarding what’s at stake this fall. What are you going to be paying special attention to moving forward as Democrats try to pass big parts of their agenda?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’ll be keeping a close eye on whether there’s any movement on axing the filibuster, though I’m <em>highly</em> skeptical this will happen. And I’m curious to examine the bubbling tensions between progressive and moderate Democrats more. I know that’s not a specific *policy thing* to watch, but it’s still fascinating, considering a lot of media attention has been on fissures within the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I’ll be watching the infrastructure vote in the House on Sept. 27. How many progressives will vote for it? And if most of them do, does that undercut their current claims that they won’t accept a number lower than $3.5 trillion for the reconciliation bill?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I suspect we’re going to see a lot of failed votes for Democrats over the next several weeks and a lot of public bargaining and a lot of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/21/democrats-biden-domestic-agenda-implode-513218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Democrats in disarray” stories</a>. But I’ll be watching to see what compromises senators are spelling out between the lines, and what they are not taking off the table.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I never ever bet against Nancy Pelosi.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In Christian art, saints often hold an object associated with their martyrdom. Saint Stephen, stoned to death, <a href="https://ssjd.ca/2020/08/19/on-the-feast-of-st-stephen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holds a pile of rocks</a>. Saint Lawrence, burned over an iron grill, <a href="https://saintlawrencemartyr.org/our-patron-saint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stands with a gridiron</a>. Saint Lucy <a href="https://www.catholicherald.com/news/catholic_living/religious_vocations/st__lucy_points_the_way_to_christ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offers a small dish</a> with two eyeballs, a reference to her own eyes having been gouged out with a fork.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the same principles applied to right-wing martyrs these days, plenty would be holding just a lawsuit with their name as the defendant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of Americans</a> who have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol have been lionized as freedom fighters by some on the right, including <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/07/29/gaetz-mtg-turned-away-from-jail-during-visit-to-jan-6-political-prisoners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members of Congress</a>. It’s what inspired the “Justice for J6” rally — the muted <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/18/1038551992/us-capitol-january-6-j6-rally-washington" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political demonstration</a> that took place this past weekend in D.C. — and it’s the culmination of years of rhetoric on the far-right that has celebrated violent, extremist figures. This tendency to beatify certain figures is something mainstream conservatives now share with extremist ideologies elsewhere. The martyrs create a sense of community and underscore an essential narrative: that you can be punished simply because of what you believe, and that the willingness to receive that punishment is worthy of reverence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lifting certain figures to a quasi-sainthood has a long history on the extreme right, dating back to the post-WWI era, according to Daniel Koehler, the director of the German Institute on Radicalization and De-Radicalization Studies. Koehler laid out this history in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19434472.2020.1822426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a paper published last year</a>, citing an example of a group of 16 Nazis killed by police during a failed coup d’état in 1923. Those Nazis became known as the “Blutzeugen” (blood witnesses), which other Nazis honored with specific flags, medals and even two “temples.” But the narrative around these and other Nazi martyrs, Koehler wrote in the paper, “explicitly used the fact (or claim) that they were always killed by the movement’s enemies.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Importantly, though, suicidal demonstrations of ideology were not part of the deal. Unlike jihadist extremists, who have cultural and religious motivations for celebrating those who die in suicide bombings, the far-right tended to elevate individuals who survived or were killed in battle, rather than those who died on a suicide mission. “What their narrative usually tells their followers is you have to stand and fight to the very end,” Koehler said in an interview.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More recently, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/7/18215634/dylann-roof-charleston-church-shooter-bowl-gang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this has manifested through the idolization</a> of mass shooters who were apprehended, such as Dylann Roof, the white supremacist terrorist who killed nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Neo-nazis and white supremacists <a href="https://www.adl.org/blog/hardcore-white-supremacists-elevate-dylann-roof-to-cult-hero-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned such terrorists into memes and icons</a>, often depicting individuals like Roof as a saint (though sometimes with tongue in cheek). The terrorists have even inspired the formation of groups like the “Bowl Gang,” named for Roof’s bowl cut hairstyle. These shooters’ manifestos and journals are routinely passed around among far-right extremist groups online, almost like sacred texts. Koehler said the celebration is because the terrorists are seen as continuing the fight and as willing to suffer personally for the cause.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This trend largely remained relegated to the extreme right until last summer, when 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed two people during protests against police shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Suddenly, those in the mainstream right had a figure to rally behind, since his actions could be explained away as self-defense, said Ari Ben-Am, an extremism researcher and information operations analyst for ActiveFence, an online security firm that detects hate speech, terrorism and disinformation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican politicians openly praised Rittenhouse, with <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/04/kyle-rittenhouse-showed-incredible-restraint-gop-rep-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky saying</a> he “exhibited incredible restraint and presence and situational awareness,” and <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonysabatini/status/1330150935771967489?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state Rep. Anthony Sabatini of Florida tweeting</a>, inexplicably, “Kyle Rittenhouse for Congress.” Far-right groups like the Proud Boys (<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-proclaimed</a> “Western chauvinists”) <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dpk4d/kyle-rittenhouse-got-a-proud-boys-serenade-at-a-bar-while-out-on-bail-prosecutors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have stated</a> they support Rittenhouse’s case and “are rooting for him. He has become an American hero and we look forward to celebrating his exoneration with a beer.” Among the more mainstream right online, such as the pro-Trump message board patriots.win, posters have been carefully following Rittenhouse’s trial and celebrating his actions, calling him “Saint Kyle”<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the saint imagery around Roof, this is sometimes done tongue-in-cheek, and other times earnestly, depending on the group and the poster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> and a “hero,” and making comments such as “Every freedom loving American should be thrilled that this young man was able to defend himself and not become a victim to the mob.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Rittenhouse was the first one to break the barrier of mainstream popularity and support,” Ben-Am said. “He was viewed by both the far-right and the mainstream right as a martyr for the cause, though the mainstream right didn’t really know how to articulate that.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The right’s response to the Jan. 6 attack was mixed. Many Republican politicians condemned the event, and alt-right conspiracy theorists floated the idea that the whole event was a false flag. This theory proposed that the rioters were actually anti-fascists, not Trump supporters. Soon, though, many rallied around those who were arrested or killed, as in the case of Ashli Babbitt, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/01/08/ashli-babbitt-shooting-video-capitol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who was shot and killed</a> by Capitol police during the attack. Those on the right have cast these individuals as martyrs in the fight against what they believe was a fraudulent election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This rallying included the Proud Boys, who have been sharing fundraisers on Telegram for the legal funds of individuals charged for allegedly participating in the attack on the Capitol. They’ve even set up a separate Telegram for promoting these fundraisers called “Free the Boys.” L. Lin Wood, the pro-Trump lawyer who filed a number of lawsuits challenging the 2020 election results and has become a celebrity of the alt-right, has also rallied around Jan. 6 arrestees, calling them “political prisoners.” And mainstream Republicans, <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/572632-trump-offers-sympathy-for-those-charged-with-jan-6-offenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including former President Trump</a> and members of Congress like <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-trump-supporters-who-breached-capitol-being-abused-fed-custody-1592629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> and <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/05/12/rep-paul-gosar-calls-jan-6-us-capitol-attackers-peaceful-patriots/5063404001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Gosar</a>, have advocated for arrestees, whom they claim are being unfairly treated. Ben-Am said this evokes the kind of lionization of terrorists on the extreme right, but with individuals who are much more palatable to the mainstream right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We started off with really extreme, decentralized individuals loving people who go kill for their ideology,” Ben-Am said. “The more mainstream it gets, the less violent and extremist the [martyrs] are.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Treating these individuals as ideological martyrs serves a number of functions within these groups, according to Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University, who studies online extremism. Having figures to rally around deepens a sense of community among people who are often largely connected only online, Squire said, while legal fundraisers provide an opportunity to signal in-group values. It also fosters a narrative of persecution that is fundamental to many of these groups since they feel they’re fighting an unjust battle against groups wishing to destroy the American way of life. Depending on which apportionment of the right-wing landscape you’re talking about, those enemies could be the Democrats, the deep state, immigrants or Satan-worshipping pedophiles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It makes what they’re fighting for [feel] on par with other serious political movements and things that have happened in history,” Squire said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the attendance at the Justice for J6 rally was modest, its messaging is evident in many places across the right, tapping into both mainstream and fringe groups. Creating martyrs serves a valuable function in these communities, which can be very energizing if tapped in the right way. And while this particular event failed to do so, the symbol of a martyr is powerful and should not be underestimated.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Last Thursday, Republican Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/us/politics/anthony-gonzalez-ohio-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced he would not seek reelection</a> in 2022. The 37-year old congressman was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump</a> after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, and he is now the first to call it quits.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Facing fervent opposition from Trump supporters in his district, a Trump-backed primary challenger and a potentially thorny redistricting process — Ohio will lose a congressional district after apportionment — Gonzalez decided there was no future for him in the GOP. It’s early yet, but Gonzalez’s retirement could foreshadow what awaits the other nine House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump; many of them could face a difficult path to reelection. And if they retire like Gonzalez or lose reelection, the outcome will likely be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congressional-republicans-left-office-in-droves-under-trump-just-how-conservative-are-their-replacements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an even Trumpier Republican Party</a> in Washington.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, all but one of these 10 Republicans has received a formal rebuke from their state or local party committees, as the table below shows. Additionally, all 10 now face at least one primary challenger (or faced, in the case of Gonzalez). While not all of these intraparty opponents are real threats, many are shaping up to be roadblocks to renomination. This is particularly true in the four districts where Trump has endorsed a primary challenger, including Gonzalez’s race, where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/07/28/max-miller-ohio-congress-trump-profile-500187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Trump aide</a> Max Miller has <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/02/former-donald-trump-aide-max-miller-announces-gop-primary-bid-against-us-rep-anthony-gonzalez-claiming-endorsement-from-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the former president’s backing</a> and, now, no incumbent to run against.</p>

 <p>Rebuke includes a censure or public admonishment by a Republican Party committee at the state, district or county level.</p>
 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And outside of Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021-22 redistricting process could be an added complication</a> for these representatives, too.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyoming will continue to have only one at-large district, so the district lines won’t change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> These 10 members can largely be split into two groups: those most endangered by primary challenges and those most endangered by redistricting. Let’s start with those facing the toughest primary hurdles — the three incumbents besides Gonzalez who face a Trump-endorsed challenger.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s endorsement track record is a bit of a mixed bag in that there is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some evidence that he padded his record in 2020</a> — that is, endorsing candidates who were already likely to win — so it’s unclear how powerful a Trump-endorsement will be in 2022. But at this point, Cheney may be in the most trouble, despite being the strongest fundraiser and the most well-known of the Republicans who backed impeachment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this month, former Republican National Committee member Harriet Hageman <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/hageman-announces-bid-to-unseat-cheney/article_47bbadd6-409f-5ff9-a8e0-9f97b6ebfd25.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered the Wyoming House race</a>, with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/09/politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-cheney-challenger/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an endorsement from Trump</a>. Hageman could prove to be a powerful opponent, too, considering <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/07/liz-cheney-potential-challenger-harriet-hageman-rnc-510315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her political background</a> and competitive showing in the 2018 GOP primary for Wyoming governor — <a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/2018/Results/Primary/2018_Statewide_Candidates_Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she won 21 percent in a crowded race</a>, finishing just 12 percentage points behind now-Gov. Mark Gordon. Hageman may also be able to consolidate <a href="https://twitter.com/allymutnick/status/1390005987399151621" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Cheney sentiment</a> in the state, which would be a blow to the incumbent, who would benefit from a large, fragmented field. Tellingly, <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/rep-chuck-gray-suspends-campaign-to-unseat-cheney/article_bdc106e0-6862-546a-8b1b-1b3c9a99806f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three other primary challengers</a> have already withdrawn from the race, <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/two-candidates-leave-house-race-on-day-of-trump-endorsement/article_667d778a-4430-5f74-8fec-a3a266ede310.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two of whom then endorsed Hageman</a>. Just one notable candidate has <a href="https://www.wyofile.com/pressure-builds-for-candidates-to-drop-out-after-trump-endorsement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to drop out</a> at this point: state Sen. Anthony Bouchard. But it’s hard to know how much support Bouchard’s candidacy will garner due to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/us/politics/anthony-bouchard-14-year-old.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the disturbing revelation</a> that he impregnated a 14-year old girl when he was 18 and married her when she was 15.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also in this category are Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington. Upton faces Trump-backed state Rep. Steve Carra, who recently <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/22/michigan-lawmaker-introduces-bill-require-election-audit/5297929001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced legislation to audit Michigan’s 2020 election results</a>. This, in large part, <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/07/trump-endorses-michigan-primary-challenger-u-s-rep-upton/5757497001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains his endorsement by the former president</a>, which could help topple Upton, who was also <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2021/02/cass-county-gop-joins-other-republicans-in-censuring-rep-fred-upton-for-impeachment-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured</a> <a href="https://www.heraldpalladium.com/communities/st_joseph/berrien-county-republican-party-leaders-vote-to-censure-upton/article_3ead8556-e09f-5276-943a-6f3dd94ba19d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by at least five</a> GOP county committees in his district for supporting impeachment. Upton has been around for a long time (he won his first election in 1986), but he might be vulnerable, too, as his lone 2020 primary opponent <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2020PRI_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won 37 percent</a> despite <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/06/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising almost no money</a> and attracting little notice — and this was before Upton voted to impeach Trump. Meanwhile, Herrera Beutler’s main challenger in Washington is <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/trump-endorses-joe-kent-republican-challenger-to-rep-jaime-herrera-beutler-who-voted-for-impeachment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump endorsee</a> Joe Kent, a former Special forces officer and husband to a Gold Star recipient. Like Carra, Kent has questioned the 2020 election results, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/politics/impeachment-republicans-house-reelection/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telling CNN in July</a> that “I think Trump won, but I want to prove it.” However, the electoral math might be more complicated in Washington than Michigan because of Washington’s top-two primary system (also used in California), where the top-two vote getters — regardless of party — advance to the November general election. If Democrats consolidate around one candidate, Herrera Beutler could still attract enough backing from some Republicans and independents to finish second and advance. Moreover, the anti-Herrera Beutler vote could be fragmented among Kent and Heidi St. John, a Christian author and home-schooling advocate who has <a href="https://www.clarkcountytoday.com/news/candidate-heidi-st-john-offers-sharp-response-to-former-presidents-endorsement-of-her-fellow-candidate-joe-kent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized Kent as a carpetbagger</a> who only recently moved to the southwestern Washington district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Reps. Tom Rice of South Carolina and Dan Newhouse of Washington don’t yet have Trump-endorsed opponents, they still face more primary woes than redistricting problems. Rice, for instance, has to win a majority of the vote in the Republican primary — or a majority in a runoff if no candidate initially wins more than 50 percent of the vote. This isn’t true of the other Republicans we’ve examined, which means a crowded candidate field could be especially tricky for Rice as he can’t skate by with a plurality win in the primary. Rice currently <a href="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/politics-government/article253295638.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces at least three serious-looking GOP opponents</a> in conservative media personality Graham Allen, state Rep. Russell Fry and Horry County school board chair Ken Richardson, along with a host of other Republicans. (Eight Republicans are running against Rice so far.) Newhouse, meanwhile, also has <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/former-washington-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-loren-culp-files-to-challenge-republican-rep-dan-newhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three notable Republican opponents</a>: Loren Culp, a former police officer and Washington’s GOP nominee for governor in 2020, as well as state Rep. Brad Klippert and businessman Jerrod Sessler. Like Herrera Beutler, Newhouse might benefit from Washington’s top-two primary format if he can retain enough base support while the other Republican contenders split the rest of the GOP vote. And Newhouse <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20160802/congressional-district-4-us-representative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has performed this feat before</a> in his solidly red district and <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20161108/congressional-district-4-us-representative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone on to win in November</a> against another Republican, so it’s plausible that his impeachment vote could win over some independent and Democratic voters in both the primary and the general. But it would not be a shock to see Trump step in to better help Republicans consolidate around one opposition candidate — perhaps Culp, who <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/loren-culp-refusing-to-concede-washington-gubernatorial-race-turns-on-top-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made false claims</a> about widespread voter fraud in the state’s 2020 gubernatorial election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for the other four other Republican representatives who voted to impeach Trump, they may face more danger from redistricting at this point. Reps. John Katko of New York and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois both hail from states where Democrats could change their district lines to make it harder for the Republicans to win reelection. Katko has held onto his Democratic-leaning district since he first won in 2014, but in an effort to defeat him, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Democrats</a> could <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1427389029562077188?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make his seat even bluer</a> and/or draw him in with Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney in the hopes that her more conservative track record would help her best Katko in a GOP primary, perhaps making her easier to defeat in a general election. So far, Katko has only <a href="https://auburnpub.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/rep-john-katko-gets-gop-primary-challenger/article_51667a90-228b-5604-89f1-d2759b84e642.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracted minor primary opposition</a>, but Trump said this summer <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2021/06/donald-trump-offers-to-back-challenger-to-rep-john-katko-he-is-bad-news.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would back a high-profile conservative challenger</a> if one could be found. Meanwhile, Kinzinger’s seat in exurban Chicago <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/25/adam-kinzinger-illinois-democrats-506861" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be dismantled</a> by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic mapmakers in Illinois</a>, potentially forcing him into an uphill race against an incumbent. And if he faces another Republican, he might have a particularly difficult time winning a primary <a href="https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1004829/gop-rep-adam-kinzinger-calls-trump-one-of-the-weakest-men-that-ive-ever-seen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given his criticism of Trump</a>. After all, even if Kinzinger ends up with a decent district to run in, he will still <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-catalina-lauf-challenge-kinzinger-congress-16th-district-20210224-rohj5knnhvfknnxxdjslqzzkny-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face a primary challenge</a> from former Trump administration official Catalina Lauf.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The two remaining Republicans who voted in favor of impeachment, Reps. David Valadao of California and Peter Meijer of Michigan, don’t have to worry about Democratic state legislators targeting them because their states use independent redistricting commissions. However, Valadao already holds the bluest seat of any Republican in the House, so any shift to the left could cost him reelection. Valadao also has to navigate the top-two primary format, but unlike Herrera Beutler and Newhouse, he doesn’t have much Republican opposition. The <a href="https://www.ourvalleyvoice.com/2021/04/16/chris-mathys-holds-town-hall-in-campaign-against-valadao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only notable Republican to pop up</a> is Chris Mathys, a former Fresno city councilman who actually ran a distant third in a GOP primary for a House seat in <em>New Mexico </em>last year. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/few-incumbents-are-safe-michigans-draft-congressional-district-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial draft maps</a> from Michigan’s redistricting commission created a Grand Rapid-based district that Trump would have carried by less than 1 point in 2020. If lines like that hold true for the final map, that could make Meijer’s seat slightly more Democratic than it is right now (<a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump +3 in 2020</a>). That area <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?type=county&amp;year=2020&amp;fips=26081&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved to the left during the Trump era</a>, and it could continue to do so. But working in Meijer’s favor is that he lacks a high-profile GOP primary opponent — the most <a href="https://www.fox17online.com/news/politics/meijer-attracts-gop-primary-challenger-after-impeachment-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable name at this point is Tom Norton</a>, who <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2020PRI_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished a distant third</a> behind Meijer in the 2020 primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Gonzalez already headed for the exits, the departure of some or most of these 10 members could have large consequences for the Republican Party — and democracy itself. Nine of the 10 Republicans who voted for impeachment ranked among the 28 Republican House members who have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-senators-and-representatives-vote-in-favor-of-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely to vote in ways to protect electoral democracy</a>, according to FiveThirtyEight’s recent analysis of congressional voting patterns.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the “bare-bones” pro-democracy vote percentage analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> In fact, Cheney, Katko and Kinzinger were the likelist members of the House GOP to vote in favor of pro-democracy positions. But those three may be most in danger of losing their seats. And now with Gonzalez’s retirement and the difficult paths to reelection for many of the other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, it seems there’s not so much an intraparty debate with the GOP about Trump’s position in the party, but rather a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-voters-say-they-dont-mind-trump-critics-but-liz-cheneys-ouster-says-otherwise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-sided battle</a> where the small minority looks set to get even smaller.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Sept. 21, 2021, 9:32 a.m.):</strong> Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was narrowly elected to a third term in Monday’s election in Canada. As of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/federal/2021/results/">9:30 a.m. Eastern on Sept. 21</a>, the Liberals had won or were ahead in 158 seats, the Conservatives had won or were ahead in 119 seats and the New Democratic Party had won or was ahead in 25 seats — very similar to their numbers in the previous Parliament.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Below is our preview of how Canada got to this point and the stakes in this election.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">It’s always an election year if you know where to look. This time, it’s up north: Canada heads to the polls today to decide whether to elect Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to another term. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Think of this election like a U.S. presidential and congressional election all rolled into one: Under Canada’s parliamentary system, each of Canada’s 338 electoral districts (called “ridings”) will elect a member of Parliament using normal first-past-the-post, plurality rules. (Unlike <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/which-european-countries-use-proportional-representation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some other parliamentary democracies</a>, Canada does not use proportional representation.) And the leader of the party that wins control of Parliament will become the new prime minister.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Right now, the election looks like a close race between Trudeau’s center-left Liberal Party and the center-right Conservative Party. But Canada’s many smaller parties could play decisive roles too. Here are five questions we’ll be looking to get answered as the results roll in starting tonight.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like in the U.S., mail voting means we won’t know the full results of the election for days. A &lt;a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/election-2021/record-number-of-mail-in-ballot-requests-means-very-likely-vote-result-wont-be-known-election-night" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;record 1.2 million mail ballots&lt;/a&gt; have been requested, and they won’t even begin to be counted until Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>15</sup></a></p>



<h2><strong>1. Did Trudeau end his own political career?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The biggest question, of course, is whether Trudeau will survive as prime minister. And if he is ousted, it could go down as one of the biggest self-owns in political history. That’s because Canada wasn’t originally scheduled to hold a vote this year; Trudeau <em>chose</em> to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-election-call-1.6141189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold an early election</a> in response to polls showing the Liberals with a solid lead. (Liberals held only 155 seats in the outgoing House of Commons<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada’s Parliament has two chambers, the Senate and House of Commons, but the Senate is not elected and the House of Commons has far more power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> — shy of a majority of 170, which made it <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/10/03/life-is-about-to-get-harder-for-canadas-minority-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difficult</a> for Trudeau to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/justin-trudeau-parliament-slow-start_ca_5e49e789c5b64433c6183bfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">govern</a>.) The strong polls gave Trudeau hope that Liberals could win a majority in a snap election. But after the election was greenlit in August, the polls immediately tightened, and the Conservatives even briefly took the lead — making Trudeau’s decision look like a huge miscalculation.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/upcoming-elections-us-political-climate-80002422</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Things are looking a bit better for the prime minister now, though. Canada has two prominent, FiveThirtyEight-style election forecasters: Philippe J. Fournier of <a href="https://338canada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">338Canada</a> and Éric Grenier, who writes the newsletter <a href="https://www.thewrit.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Writ</a> and runs the <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poll Tracker</a> for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when Canada had just 308 ridings, Grenier also used to issue his forecasts at &lt;a href="http://www.threehundredeight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ThreeHundredEight.com&lt;/a&gt;. This numbers-as-website-names thing is sweeping the globe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>17</sup></a> And as of Sunday evening,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> they gave Liberals a 68 percent and 75 percent chance of winning the most seats, respectively. However, it looks pretty unlikely that Trudeau will get his coveted majority government: There is only a 15-17 percent chance that Liberals win 170 or more seats. In fact, both the Poll Tracker (154) and 338Canada (147) are estimating that Liberals will win fewer seats than the 155 they had before the election, though of course there is a wide margin of error on those projections. So Trudeau may yet live to regret calling this election.</p>



<h2><strong>2. How will the Conservatives do under their new leader?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is also a high-risk, high-reward election for the Conservative Party’s Erin O’Toole, who was chosen as the Conservative leader just last year. While O’Toole was initially <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/party-leaders-canada-abacus-july-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular with the Canadian public</a>, his centrist persona has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/10/canada-election-erin-otoole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped make the party competitive</a> (though he has also had some <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8169157/otoole-firearm-bans-conservative-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stumbles</a>). These days, the Poll Tracker gives Conservatives an average seat projection of 118 and a 25 percent chance of winning the most seats, while 338Canada is a little more optimistic for them (127 seats and a 31 percent chance). So while the likeliest outcome is that they will stand pat or make only small gains (they went into the election with 119 seats), they are still only a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal polling error away</a> from becoming the biggest party in the House of Commons. On the flip side, though, there is still a significant chance that they lose seats, which could cost O’Toole his job as party leader.</p>

<h2><strong>3. How many seats will the New Democrats gain?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Canada differs from the U.S. in that an analysis of its elections can’t stop with just the two dominant parties. The left-wing New Democratic Party is also a major player; in fact, it could be the biggest beneficiary of this election. The Poll Tracker and 338Canada are forecasting that the NDP will win 34 seats and 32 seats, respectively, up from 24 in the previous Parliament. That’s largely thanks to the charisma of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/a-long-time-coming-jagmeet-singh-s-victory-a-historic-win-for-visible-minorities-1.4316002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first person of color to lead a major Canadian party</a>; he <a href="https://angusreid.org/federal-election-post-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently</a> <a href="https://researchco.ca/2021/09/14/elxn44-canada-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earns</a> the <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8145113/canada-election-ipsos-leadership-singh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest favorable ratings</a> of <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/daily-tracking-poll-election-44-sept-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any of the party leaders</a>. Nevertheless, the NDP has still struggled to break into the first tier. It trails the Liberals and Conservatives by double digits in the polls, and the forecasters give the party virtually no chance of winning the most seats.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Will the nascent right-wing parties be a factor?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Like in the U.S., Canada’s right wing has gotten increasingly vocal in recent years (although it represents a much smaller slice of the population than in the U.S.). A new party called the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/maverick-party-alberta-wexit-election-1.6173047" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maverick Party</a>, which advocates for the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-separatism-anger-election-trudeau-1.5336196" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secession</a> of conservative parts of Western Canada, is running <a href="https://www.maverickparty.ca/candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates</a> in 29 ridings, mostly in the rural, inland provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. And former Conservative cabinet minister Maxime Bernier recently splintered off to form the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49719947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People’s Party of Canada</a>, which was originally known for its climate-change skepticism and hardline stance against immigration but this year has become a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/13/canada-election-conservative-ppc-maxime-bernier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vessel for opposition</a> to coronavirus lockdowns, mask mandates and vaccines. (Bernier himself is <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/maxime-bernier-rally-1.6166298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not vaccinated</a> against COVID-19 and was <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/maxime-bernier-manitoba-taken-into-custody-1.6062801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested in June</a> for refusing to self-quarantine after traveling.) According to a recent poll from <a href="http://poll.forumresearch.com/post/3093/opinions-on-vaccines--abortion--gun-control--climate-change-and-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forum Research</a>, 62 percent of PPC supporters were unvaccinated, and 70 percent were “very angry” with the policies of the Canadian government. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Maverick Party is specifically running candidates almost exclusively in solidly Conservative seats, the PPC has a candidate in 312 of the 338 ridings and could very well play spoiler to the Conservatives. Though the PPC is not expected to win any seats of its own, it is averaging around 6-7 percent in the polls,<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And interestingly, there is a methodological difference in which polls are picking up more PPC support. According to &lt;a href="https://www.thewrit.ca/p/who-is-voting-for-the-ppc-and-will" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis from Grenier&lt;/a&gt;, online pollsters tend to show lower numbers for the party, while pollsters that use robocalls are finding PPC support as high as the double digits. So the PPC could do even better than we’re expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>19</sup></a> enough to <a href="https://www.thewrit.ca/p/who-is-voting-for-the-ppc-and-will" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost the Conservatives a win in some close ridings</a>. And even if it doesn’t, it will be interesting to see how deep anti-establishment grievances run in Trudeau’s Canada.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Will we get another counter-majoritarian result?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the <a href="https://www.elections.ca/res/rep/off/ovr2019app/51/table9E.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous Canadian election</a>, in 2019, Trudeau was actually reelected while losing the national popular vote: The Liberals won 33.1 percent of the vote to the Conservatives’ 34.3 percent. But the Liberals won the most seats because, unlike in the U.S., Canadian geography puts the <em>right</em> at a disadvantage. The places in Canada where one party runs up the biggest margins (thus wasting votes) are not liberal cities but conservative rural areas: In 2019, every candidate who got 70 percent of the vote or more was a Conservative.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible the same thing could happen in 2021: The Liberals and the Conservatives are locked in a virtual tie in the polls at around 31-32 percent. That said, the Liberals are still favored to carry the most seats in that configuration because of the <a href="https://www.thewrit.ca/p/conservative-vote-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conservatives’ vote inefficiency</a>. In fact, Grenier recently estimated that the Conservatives will need to win the national popular vote by more than 3 points to be favored to win the most seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s worth noting that the combined vote of the Liberals and the NDP — whose voters <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8167090/canada-election-voter-choice-ipsos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally prefer</a> Trudeau to O’Toole as their second choice — will surely far exceed the Conservative vote (as it did in 2019). So Conservatives winning the most seats with only a plurality of the vote could also be considered a counter-majoritarian outcome. (The possibility of vote-splitting has led to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00323187090610020301?journalCode=pnzb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many calls</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons_Special_Committee_on_Electoral_Reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electoral reform</a> in Canada, but they haven’t gained traction.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a twist: Thanks to the quirks of the parliamentary system, it’s possible that Conservatives could win the most seats <em>and Trudeau would remain prime minister</em>. Unlike an American president, Trudeau <a href="https://ipolitics.ca/2021/09/10/even-if-reduced-to-2nd-place-trudeau-has-the-right-to-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remains prime minister</a> unless he resigns or is defeated in the House of Commons, and it’s possible that the NDP<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or other left-leaning members of Parliament; the problem is that there likely won’t be many others. The Green Party, for instance, will be lucky to win two seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> would side with the Liberals to keep Trudeau in power. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Coalition governments are <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/coalition-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rare in Canada</a>, though, so Trudeau would probably only try to cling to power in this way if the circumstances were perfect — namely, if Liberals come a very close second to Conservatives in the overall seat count. But it does mean that Trudeau’s chances of staying prime minister are probably higher than the 68-75 percent chance that Liberals have of winning the most seats. Then again, reelection in this way would hardly be a win for Trudeau, as it would put him in a very precarious situation politically — which could lead to more governmental dysfunction and thus, perhaps, another premature election as soon as next year.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roughly two weeks ago, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a highly restrictive abortion law went into effect in Texas</a>, outlawing abortions once fetal cardiac activity can be detected — usually about six weeks into a pregnancy — which is before most women know they are pregnant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, the Department of Justice <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-files-injunction-halt-enforcement-texas-abortion-law/story?id=80026088" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed an emergency injunction</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/09/15/texas-abortion-justice-department-block/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking a judge</a> to halt the law, and a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/15/texas-abortion-law-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing is set for early next month</a> to consider temporarily blocking it, but, as of today, <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/san-antonio/news/2021/09/16/texas-abortion-law-strains-clinics---exactly-what-we-feared-v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no one in Texas</a> has brought a suit against an abortion provider in the state; clinics have said <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/31/texas-abortion-law-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they plan to abide</a> by the law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that hasn’t stopped abortion from once again being at the forefront of American politics. Beyond the Texas law, there is a law in Mississippi <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/17/abortion-supreme-court-takes-case-mississippi-15-week-ban/6056970002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning most abortions</a> after 15 weeks of pregnancy that the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-dont-want-roe-v-wade-repealed-but-many-also-support-restrictions-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is expected to take up later this year</a>. This means abortion could reshape next year’s midterm elections. And although abortion has historically animated Republican voters more, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-may-be-mobilizing-more-democratic-voters-than-republicans-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is proving to be</a> a motivation for Democrats, too. During the summer of 2018, shortly after then-President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh</a> to the Supreme Court, Democrats were increasingly likely to say abortion was an important factor in how they would vote that year. So it’s likely that this year and next, as Roe’s legal status is up in the air and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more states move to pass restrictive abortion bills</a>, the issue will be a top concern for many Democratic voters.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/texas-abortion-ban-rest-country-fivethirtyeight-79824406</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">A recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/07/women-abortion-texas-law-top-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> of registered voters suggests that Democratic women are already prioritizing the issue more than they were prior to Texas’s law taking effect. Per their survey, 14 percent of Democratic women said issues like abortion, contraception and equal pay are their top voting concerns — up 6 percentage points from before the Texas law took effect. To be sure, though, abortion isn’t <em>the</em> top voting issue for Democratic women. The survey notes that the economy (25 percent) and health care (18 percent) each ranked as higher priorities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, among Democrats overall, 10 percent said that abortion, contraception and equal pay were top of mind when voting — up from 5 points from before Texas’s law. Independents seemed to care about these issues, too. The share of independent women who listed these issues as top concerns jumped from 7 percent before the law went into effect, to 10 percent after. (Among all independents, the increase was smaller: 4 percent then to 6 percent now.) Republicans, however, didn’t really budge on the issue. Among Republican women, the percentage who said the issues of abortion, contraception and equal pay were top of mind increased from only 2 percent to 3 percent — the same numbers as for Republicans overall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Majorities of voters have also said they don’t want the high court to overturn Roe. According to a September <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/9/7/amid-texas-abortion-ban-voters-strongly-support-reproductive-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data for Progress</a> survey, which was fielded after the Texas law took effect, 60 percent of likely voters said the Supreme Court should keep Roe intact. This was up 3 points from a similar <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/6/8/voters-agree-that-the-supreme-court-should-uphold-roe-v-wade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data for Progress</a> poll fielded in May. Meanwhile, a September survey from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/hlzpfslijb/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> found that 50 percent of U.S. adults did not<em> </em>want Roe overturned, versus 28 percent who did; this aligns with a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/03/04/roe-v-wade-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate YouGov poll</a> from last year, which found that 49 percent of adults wanted Roe to remain, while only a quarter wanted it overturned. And earlier this month, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/09/09/democrats-displeasure-supreme-court-decision-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov found</a> that half of Americans (50 percent) disapproved of the Texas abortion law, while just 36 percent were in favor of it.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s still early, and even if abortion rights energizes Democrats now, it’s hard to know whether it will be top of mind for them heading into the 2022 midterms. It’s also possible that this issue will also energize anti-abortion Republican voters, as Kavanaugh’s nomination <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-kavanaugh-helping-republicans-midterm-chances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seems to have done in 2018</a>. Back then, GOP voters saw Trump — and the appointment of Kavanaugh — as a way to have a solidly anti-abortion Supreme Court majority, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/us/politics/abortion-republicans-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans began attacking certain Democratic candidates</a> who supported abortion rights or had received funding from Planned Parenthood. Some Republican senators running in red states also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/us/politics/kavanaugh-republicans-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used Kavanaugh and his fight for Senate confirmation</a> to energize voters in states Trump had won in 2016. This was less true in House races — after all, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-it-was-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 was a “blue wave” for Democrats</a> — but in the Senate, it meant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/conservatives-senate-judges-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some staunch, anti-abortion conservatives</a> like Sens. <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/06/claire-mccaskill-vs-josh-hawley-missouri-senate-race-results-2018-963520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josh Hawley</a> in Missouri and <a href="https://www.sba-list.org/newsroom/press-releases/sba-list-declares-victory-pro-life-mike-braun-defeats-donnelly-indiana-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Braun</a> in Indiana were able to defeat incumbent Democrat senators who had voted against Kavanaugh’s nomination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible, then, that abortion will once again energize conservative voters, turning their focus to opportunities to ban abortion elsewhere — not just in the nation’s most conservative states. Which is why we’ll be watching whether other red states move to mirror Texas’s laws — as <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/states-lawmakers-copy-texas-abortion-law/story?id=79818701" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some have already promised to do</a> — and how that might animate GOP voters, as well as the extent to which Democratic voters continue to prioritize abortion rights while Roe’s legal status remains in limbo. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Earlier this month, President Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-order-federal-workers-vaccinated-strategy-combat-delta/story?id=79905030">announced vaccine and testing requirements</a> for both federal employees and private businesses with more than 100 employees. As my colleague Maggie Koerth <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccines-mandates-work-but-theyre-messy-business/">reported last week</a>, vaccine mandates <em>do </em>work — and recent polling suggests that Americans are largely on board with the federal government issuing the mandates. Per the latest <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd__5LyoGqiiaqCuEVAzYJq1U3s49OGfHtrvVuvXvpnX6c-1631651493-0-gqNtZGzNAjujcnBszQb9">Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index</a>, 60 percent of Americans supported Biden’s vaccine mandates. Similarly, 57 percent of Americans supported their own employer requiring vaccines in the workplace. Of course, though, there was a partisan divide. Republicans, who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccine-hesitancy-is-still-strong-in-many-covid-19-battered-states/">are generally more wary</a> about getting the jab, were less likely to support Biden’s policies, according to the poll. Only around one-third of Republicans said they backed Biden’s new requirement on federal employees and his mandate on private businesses. Among Democrats, however, 84 percent supported both mandates.</li><li>Most Americans feel that democracy in the U.S. is under attack or at least being tested, according to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/15/politics/cnn-poll-most-americans-democracy-under-attack/index.html">CNN/SSRS poll</a>. In total, 93 percent of Americans said democracy was either under attack (56 percent) or being tested but not necessarily under attack (37 percent). Republicans were the most likely to say that democracy is under attack (75 percent), compared with just 46 percent of Democrats. This might have something to do with how both self-described conservatives (71 percent) and Americans who disapproved of President Biden (71 percent) were the most likely to believe democracy was under attack .</li><li>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/14/americans-are-less-concerned-but-more-divided-on-climate-change-than-people-elsewhere/">the Pew Research Center published</a> a far-reaching study into the concerns around climate change among residents in some of the world’s most economically developed countries. Among U.S. adults, 60 percent said they were worried about the personal impacts of climate change, whereas, across the 17 nations surveyed, a median of 72 percent of adults shared this sentiment. Notably, an overwhelming majority of people (a median of 80 percent) in these 17 nations — which included places like South Korea, Italy, Japan and Australia — said they’d be willing to make at least some changes to their personal and work lives to help mitigate climate change. Seventy-four percent of Americans said they’d be open to making some changes, too. </li><li>Tailgates, face paint and packed stadiums are back as the 2021 NFL and NCAA football seasons have kicked off while the coronavirus pandemic continues. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/week-1-of-the-nfl-season-already-has-us-changing-our-minds/">Week one of the NFL season</a> has wrapped up, and four of the league’s 32 teams — the Buffalo Bills, Las Vegas Raiders, New Orleans Saints and Seattle Seahawks — have a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/buffalo-bills-require-proof-vaccination-fans-80022380">vaccination or testing policy in place for fans</a>. And according to <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/nfl-favorability-at-67-as-fans-back-vaccination-digital-tickets/">a Harris/Sportico poll</a>, 66 percent of Americans were in favor of a vaccine mandate for fans. But despite <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-player-vaccination-rate-holds-at-93-following-roster-cuts">93 percent of NFL players</a> being vaccinated, <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bears/latest-nfl-rules-covid-fan-vaccinations-and-positive-cases">no team in the NFL</a> has mandated its players to get vaccinated, although the same poll showed that 69 percent of Americans supported such a mandate for coaches and players. </li><li>Most Americans support letting at least some Afghans resettle in the U.S. Per an <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news_and_polls/over-two-thirds-americans-support-resettling-afghan-allies-united-states-09092021">NPR/Ipsos poll</a>, 74 percent of Americans supported admitting Afghans who had worked with the U.S. government, 73 percent supported admitting Afghans who had served in the Afghan special forces and 65 percent supported admitting Afghans who feared oppression from the Taliban. But as FiveThirtyEight contributor Michael Tesler wrote recently, past polling data shows that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-have-a-long-history-of-opposing-refugees-but-most-support-afghan-asylum-seekers/">Americans have a history of opposing refugees</a>, so it’s possible public opinion on this question could eventually fall, although it hasn’t yet.</li><li>Last year, to cope with the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, most Americans <a href="https://www.axios.com/americans-drinking-alcohol-pandemic-29ee70d7-40ae-4e71-807a-3f4ad2ee19b8.html">turned to alcohol</a>. But now many are at least trying to curb their drinking, according to a recent <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/most-americans-personal-drinking-habits-remain-unchanged-recent-months">Cutback Coach/Ipsos poll</a> (<a href="https://cutbackcoach.com/blog/state-of-drinking-fall-2021">Cutback Coach</a>, who sponsored the poll, aims to help people who drink implement healthier habits). Per their survey, 50 percent of Americans said they’d made an effort to drink less or implement healthier drinking habits over the last three months, though just 20 percent said they drank less in that timeframe. On the other hand, 55 percent said their personal drinking habits stayed the same over the last three months, while 26 percent said they were drinking more now than three months ago.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">As it is every two years, control of the House and Senate will once again be at stake in the November 2022 midterm elections, and one of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-the-best-tool-we-have-for-understanding-how-the-midterms-are-shaping-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best tools we have</a> for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-works-in-presidential-years-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicting those election results</a> is polling of the generic congressional ballot. The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2002/10/01/why-the-generic-ballot-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot question</a> typically asks respondents which party they intend to vote for in the upcoming congressional election, without naming specific candidates<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact wording can vary. For example, some pollsters ask whether respondents plan to vote for the Democratic candidate or the Republican candidate for Congress; others ask whether respondents would prefer a Congress controlled by Democrats or Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> — allowing the question to be asked nationally to gauge the overall political environment. And for several years now, we at FiveThirtyEight have been <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collecting these polls</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculating</a> a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted average</a> for them, and we’re excited today to publish our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot average for the 2022 election cycle</a>. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1296" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERAL-BALLOT-STORY-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERAL-BALLOT-STORY-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERAL-BALLOT-STORY-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERAL-BALLOT-STORY-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As of Thursday, Sept. 16, Democrats lead Republicans in our polling average by 2.7 percentage points (43.8 percent to 41.1 percent). This average is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-were-tracking-joe-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculated much the same way</a> as our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential approval-rating average</a>, with a couple of differences. First, the lines we draw for the generic-ballot averages are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-a-new-less-volatile-version-of-our-generic-ballot-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more aggressively smoothed</a>;<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the model uses a blend of different quadratic smoothers, with bandwidths of 14, 28 and 42 days (as opposed to 10, 20 and 30 days for the presidential-approval average), and averages these three estimates together. The bandwidth reflects the number of days used to calculate the polynomial: For instance, a 28-day bandwith applied on Sept. 29 would mean that polls from Sept. 1 to Sept. 29 are used in the calculation. The model also requires that a minimum of 20 polls be used in the calculation, so the time intervals under consideration could be even longer in the event of sparse data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> in other words, they are slower to respond to new data. (Because generic-ballot polls are less common than presidential-approval polls, we’ve found that, to filter out noise, the generic-ballot average needs to incorporate a larger sample of polls stretching further back in time than the presidential-approval average.) Second, while our presidential-approval average prefers the versions of polls that survey the widest universe (i.e., all adults over registered voters, and registered voters over likely voters), our generic-ballot average does the opposite. This is because, while we’re interested in knowing what all Americans think about the president, generic-ballot polls are fundamentally election polls — and we’re interested only in how actual voters are going to vote in the midterms. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Historically, a generic-ballot polling average calculated in this way has been very good at predicting the national popular vote for the U.S. House. Using our polling database, we’re able to calculate a retroactive generic-ballot polling average<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, what our generic-ballot average &lt;em&gt;would have&lt;/em&gt; said if FiveThirtyEight had been around at the time and used this same methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> for congressional elections going back to 1980. On average, across those 21 election cycles, our generic-ballot polling average on Election Day missed the House popular vote by only 3.0 points.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1392" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERIC-BALLOT-STORY.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERIC-BALLOT-STORY.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERIC-BALLOT-STORY.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERIC-BALLOT-STORY.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Yes, as you might recall, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-was-the-national-polling-environment-so-off-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic-ballot polls misled in the 2020 election</a>: They gave Democrats an average lead of 7.3 points on Nov. 3, but the party won the House popular vote by only 3.0 points. But that was an unusually large polling error by recent historical standards. In fact, from 2008 to 2018, the average error of our retroactive Election Day generic-ballot polling averages was just 1.3 points. So, 2020 aside, final generic-ballot polls have been remarkably accurate in recent years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, that’s only an argument to pay attention to our generic-ballot average on <a href="https://www.when-is.com/election-day-2022.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nov. 8, 2022</a> — not necessarily today. But it turns out that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-just-look-at-trumps-approval-rating-to-judge-his-first-100-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early generic-ballot polls can be predictive too</a> — if you know how to interpret them. Specifically, for midterm elections, you have to take into account which party holds the White House, since that party is at a natural disadvantage in midterm elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Specifically, the generic-ballot polling average the previous September overestimates the president’s party’s vote margin by an average of 3.5 points.<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or 5.2 points if you throw out the 2002 cycle, which, as we’ll explain below, was very unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> This is the manifestation of one of the most ironclad rules in politics: The party that holds the White House <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-that-loses-this-year-could-still-win-a-big-consolation-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost always performs poorly in the midterms</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, there have been some exceptions. Most notable is the 2002 cycle, when then-President George W. Bush’s Republicans trailed in early generic-ballot polls by 6.7 points but wound up winning the House popular vote by 4.6 points. But that year was, well, exceptional: A <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rally-around-the-flag-events-are-rare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally-around-the-flag effect</a> in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks made Bush incredibly popular, and those good feelings rubbed off on his party. The 2006 and 2018 cycles were also exceptions in that the president’s party neither lost nor gained significant ground between the polls and actual results; early generic-ballot polls nailed the final margin almost exactly. But in both those years, the early polls <em>already</em> pointed toward a bad year for the president’s party, showing Bush’s and then-President Donald Trump’s Republicans down by 8.0 and 8.3 points, respectively.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In years when the president’s party leads the generic-ballot polling average the September before the midterms, the party underperforms those polls by an average of 9.3 points. And that, in a nutshell, is why Democrats should be concerned about the 2022 elections despite their current lead on the generic ballot. This cycle so far looks a lot like former President Barack Obama’s two midterms (2010 and 2014) did for Democrats in that they lead generic-ballot polls by a few points in the September of the year before the election. But in both those years, Republicans eventually moved ahead in our generic-ballot polling average and won the election handily.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, if Republicans outperform their early polling to a similar degree as they did in 2010 and 2014, they could win the House popular vote by 5 to 7 percentage points, which would very likely hand them control of the House (and probably the Senate too, since almost everyone votes a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">straight party-line ticket</a> these days). Of course, though, that’s a big <em>if</em>; there has been a lot of variability in these historical trends, so a wide range of outcomes is still possible. But even if Republicans only improve their standing a <em>little</em> bit — something that is likely to happen, if history is any guide — it would probably still be enough to flip the House, considering that their <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-won-almost-every-election-where-redistricting-was-at-stake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control of the redistricting process in a plurality of states</a> is likely to reinforce the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP’s structural advantage in House races</a>. Past trends don’t always hold true, but the smart money, at this point, remains on the president’s party losing control of Congress next year.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">California’s recall election <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/california-recall-election-newsom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has understandably dominated headlines</a>, but there are two other gubernatorial elections this November that might tell us more about the national environment: Virginia and New Jersey. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, President Joe Biden <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried both of these states</a> by double-digit margins in 2020, and neither state has been terribly hospitable to Republicans since former President Trump won the 2016 election. But in recent weeks, Biden’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-declining-approval-rating-is-not-just-about-afghanistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating has taken a sizable hit</a> as the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated and the delta variant of COVID-19 has complicated his efforts to steer the country out of the pandemic. In fact, Biden’s approval rating has fallen to about its lowest point (about 46 percent), while his disapproval rating is up to 49 percent, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>. The upshot is that Biden’s worsening ratings could improve the GOP’s chances of winning these gubernatorial races, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-virginia-governors-race-says-about-where-the-two-parties-are-headed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly in Virginia</a>, which is a more competitive state than New Jersey and doesn’t have an incumbent seeking reelection. Here is the state of play in these two elections a little less than two months before November:</p>



<h2><strong>Virginia</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Virginia has looked like a blue state recently because Biden won the state by 10 percentage points and Democrats have won 13 consecutive statewide races dating back to 2012,<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President and U.S. Senate in 2012; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2013; U.S. Senate in 2014; president in 2016; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2017; U.S. Senate in 2018; and president and U.S. Senate in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> but it’s really more of a purple state with a bluish hue. In 2017, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2017&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the state by 9 points</a> in a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic-leaning political environment</a> with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular Republican president in office</a>. But now with a somewhat unpopular Democrat in the White House, the pendulum could swing back enough to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/07/virginia-governors-race-might-not-be-slam-dunk-democrat-terry-mcauliffe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give Virginia Republicans a real chance at victory</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Virginia prohibits elected governors from seeking consecutive terms, meaning Northam can’t run again this year, but Democrats may have a slight incumbency advantage with nominee Terry McAuliffe: He previously <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2013&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the governorship in 2013</a> when Barack Obama was president — breaking a streak dating back to 1977 whereby the party in the White House lost the Virginia governor’s race. However, Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin has been able to use his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governors-race-financial-disclosures/2021/07/01/b697b70e-da9c-11eb-9bbb-37c30dcf9363_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal wealth</a> to <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/governor/elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay even in the fundraising race</a> with McAuliffe, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/us/politics/in-clinton-fund-raising-expect-a-full-embrace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a track record</a> of raising huge sums. This means that the biggest challenge for Youngkin is not whether he can match McAuliffe in fundraising, but whether he can balance appealing to the GOP base without repelling suburban voters in the state’s metropolitan areas, which he’ll need to win statewide in November.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/upcoming-elections-us-political-climate-80002422</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And the polls at this point suggest the race is pretty close. While McAuliffe <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has led every</a> nonpartisan survey so far, his edge among likely voters has ranged from very competitive to not so competitive (anywhere from 2 to 9 points) since early August. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been much polling released since Biden’s approval rating dropped sharply in mid-to-late August, so it’s hard to know how much of a factor that might be, but we do have one high-quality poll from late August by <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_VA_083121/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University that found</a> McAuliffe ahead by just 5 points, 47 percent to 42 percent, among registered voters. Monmouth’s poll also showed how much turnout could matter in November, as its likely voter results had McAuliffe leading by 2 to 7 points. Our most recent poll, though, is an early-September survey conducted by WPA Intelligence on behalf of Youngkin’s campaign, and <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/523895547/ACFrOgAx7A2J4aZ5gzvUrC92m1AvQlgq7AiRgaBqdvSzsWy2dFKVJM2ppsPeJVebUaROYVBDl8K1TcxXJZldH8-XA0-O7aelJSgbpn1yhfsWQM08PdjXZRmmrnAwAPM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this survey found the race</a> tied and Youngkin ahead by 2 points when <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/local-election-hq/princess-blanding-will-be-on-the-nov-2-ballot-in-the-race-for-virginia-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive third-party candidate</a> Princess Blanding was included as a choice. To be sure, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls should be taken with a grain of salt</a>, but given Biden’s recent drop in approval, it wouldn’t be a shock if Youngkin were, in fact, running neck-and-neck with McAuliffe.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear whether Biden’s drop in approval will stick, but another reason this race is a good proxy for the 2022 midterms is that the race has featured many of the same issues we’ve seen pop up lately in national politics. For instance, there have already been a number of conflicts over how best to combat the coronavirus, with <a href="https://youtu.be/4eaDAX29ogM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAuliffe backing</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-mask-vaccine-mandates/2021/08/12/05eb7d70-fad4-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine and mask mandates</a> and Youngkin opposed to such mandates even though he <a href="https://www.nbc29.com/2021/08/12/mcauliffe-youngkin-call-virginians-get-vaccinated-disagree-about-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said he wants people to get vaccinated</a> and that <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2021/08/08/glenn-youngkin-makes-trip-staunton-show-support-law-enforcement-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those who want to wear masks should do so</a>. Monmouth’s poll suggests, though, that most Virginians approve of <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_va_090821/https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_va_090821/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state requiring students, teachers and staff to wear masks at schools</a> (67 percent), and a slim majority also backed vaccine mandates for children of all ages to attend school in person (52 percent), so this will be an early test of how much the different parties’ stances on handling the pandemic affects voters’ choices. </p>

				Our Best Tool For Predicting Midterm Elections Doesn’t Show A Republican Wave — But History Is On The GOP’s Side <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/?cid=_inlinerelated">Read more. »</a>

<p data-paragraph="main">This election will also serve as an indication of how toxic <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-virginia-elections-election-2020-campaign-2016-c87bf923a4ea7d04e8eb49ad683964b7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s brand remains in Virginia</a>. Trump garnered only about 44 percent of Virginia’s vote in both 2016 and 2020 — <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;type=state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the lowest presidential vote shares</a> for a Republican in the once-red state since 1968. Unsurprisingly, McAuliffe <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/23/biden-youngkin-trump-mcauliffe-campaign-500713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has repeatedly</a> tried to connect Youngkin to the former president, including by attacking Youngkin over <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/youngkin-virginia-election-integrity-rally/2021/08/06/1cf4407a-f538-11eb-9738-8395ec2a44e7_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Republican nominee’s calls for more voting restrictions</a> following Trump’s unfounded claims of election fraud, and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/570732-mcauliffe-releases-new-ad-tying-youngkin-to-trump-on-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by arguing</a> that, like Trump, Youngkin isn’t taking the coronavirus seriously.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Youngkin <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/virginia-campaign-will-test-whether-critical-race-theory-moves-voters-11627304401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tried to hone in on critical race theory</a> — a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades-old academic concept</a> that asserts the existence of systemic racism — which has become a favorite boogeyman of conservatives. As such, Youngkin has <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/billionaire-glenn-youngkin-vows-race-theory-ban-in-bid-for-votes-f9g9vtz09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised to ban</a> the teaching of critical race theory from Virginia schools (<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/10/glenn-youngkin/youngkin-offers-little-proof-critical-race-theory-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite little evidence</a> it’s actually being taught), which he hopes <a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/critical-race-theory-to-face-first-major-political-test-in-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will hurt</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/08/07/northern-virginia-governor-elections-republican/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ support</a> in key suburban communities like Loudoun County, where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/07/07/could-a-school-board-fight-over-critical-race-theory-help-turn-virginia-red-498453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there have been high-profile anti-critical race theory protests</a> at school board meetings, though the <a href="https://vpm.org/news/articles/22982/false-claims-of-critical-race-theory-in-virginia-schools-spark-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">county denies teaching the theory</a>. And a <a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/about/news/rc_poll_politics_aug_2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roanoke College poll</a> from early August suggests that Virginian voters might be concerned about critical race theory. The poll found that slightly more Virginian voters (47 percent) familiar with critical race theory had an unfavorable view of it than a favorable view (40 percent). Youngkin <a href="https://youtu.be/XW-91ocurlI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also argued</a> that McAuliffe did a poor job of handling crime as governor and that the Democratic nominee has the support of groups that want to defund the police amid a national environment where <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;type=state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violent crime rose in 2020</a>. And it seems as if McAuliffe may view this as a potential weakness, as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/568588-mcauliffe-fires-back-at-youngkin-with-ad-touting-support-from-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s already run an ad featuring endorsements</a> from law enforcement officials, who attacked Youngkin over proposed budget cuts that could reduce funding for public safety.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, what happens in Virginia come November will be a test of just how blue the state is, with possible repercussions for the 2022 midterms. Should McAuliffe win despite Biden’s sliding approval rating, that could signal that the Old Dominion really is the Blue Dominion. But if Youngkin wins, that would be evidence that Virginia remains competitive enough that, under favorable conditions, Republicans can still win statewide.</p>



<h2><strong>New Jersey</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in New Jersey, incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is seeking a second term, but at this point, it seems that Murphy’s Republican opponent, former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, will need a lot more help from the national environment in order to defeat Murphy. New Jersey is a bluer state than Virginia — Biden won it by about 16 points in 2020 — and Murphy is a relatively popular incumbent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here, too, the most recent nonpartisan poll of the race comes from <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nj_081821.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University</a> (in the school’s home state), which found Murphy ahead of Ciattarelli by 16 points among registered voters in mid-August. In its two different likely voter scenarios, Monmouth gave Murphy a lead of 11 or 19 points. Moreover, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_nj_082321/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the survey also found</a> 54 percent of voters approved of Murphy’s job performance compared with only 36 percent who disapproved. But this poll was conducted before Biden’s sharp downturn in approval, so it’s possible conditions may have shifted somewhat, although still probably not as much as in Virginia. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The only other recent poll we’ve seen comes from Republican outfit Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates, which found Murphy ahead only by 1 to 2 points in a <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-21-new-jersey-gov-race-memo-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey on behalf of the conservative Club for Growth PAC</a>. And while the same caveats about internal polls in Virginia apply here, the result is far afield from nonpartisan polling, suggesting further polling is needed to see if the race has changed. (For instance, a June poll from <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/fdu-poll-murphy-leads-a-mostly-unknown-ciatterelli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairleigh Dickinson University found Murphy up 15 points</a>.) In fact, a better indication that this race is competitive will be whether Club for Growth spends on behalf of Ciattarelli in the coming weeks.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And Ciattarelli could use some outside financial support, too. We haven’t seen new fundraising numbers since before the June primary, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nj-state-wire-donald-trump-health-coronavirus-pandemic-government-and-politics-e3a2e5b0c7edf92834a0218d0a2d3441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murphy led Ciattarelli</a> by nearly $2 million and he also <a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/07/5-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a massive edge</a> in fundraising by outside groups, as Murphy’s allies at New Direction for New Jersey raised $13.6 million, far more than the nearly $250,000 raised by Ciattarelli’s ally Fix NJ Now. Murphy might have had an even bigger financial advantage if he could self-fund, but <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/fr/murphy-ciattarelli-receive-additional-matching-funds-as-elec-disperses-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s accepted public financing</a> for his campaign, which <a href="https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/gubernatorial/GubPublicFinPP_112020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatly limits personal spending</a>. Still, Republicans are hoping to portray the wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive as an out-of-touch elite. Last month, for instance, the Republican Governors Association <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/governor/rga-enters-n-j-race-with-tv-ad-blasting-murphy/?link_id=51&amp;can_id=8094ef3ca9e2fe4af466070f61a27eb7&amp;source=email-morning-digest-how-the-glory-days-have-passed-the-jersey-gop-by&amp;email_referrer=email_1265447&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-how-the-glory-days-have-passed-the-jersey-gop-by" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran an ad</a> criticizing Murphy for <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/14/nj-gov-phil-murphy-vacations-in-italy-despite-delta-variant-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going on vacation at his Italian villa</a> despite a surge in the delta variant of COVID-19. Meanwhile, Ciattarelli is a lifelong resident of the state, which he <a href="https://eu.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/charles-stile/2021/08/23/nj-governor-race-jack-ciattarelli-phil-murphy-stile/8210195002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tried to use to his advantage</a>, arguing that he’s the “real” New Jerseyan, since Murphy grew up in Massachusetts. As such, Ciattarelli’s <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/08/murphys-gop-rival-slams-him-on-high-nj-taxes-in-first-tv-ad-of-gov-campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first general-election ad</a> attacked Murphy for a 2019 comment in which the governor said that if “you’re a one-issue voter and the tax rate is your issue, we’re probably not your state,” which Ciattarelli argues is a sign Murphy is “<a href="https://twitter.com/Jack4NJ/status/1425808034392121349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too rich to care</a>” about the state. Taxes could be an opening for Ciattarelli, too, as 32 percent of voters named property taxes as a key issue facing New Jersey in Monmouth’s poll. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the same Monmouth poll found 41 percent of voters were especially concerned about COVID-19 — their top issue in a list of more than 20 — and Murphy’s handling of the pandemic has received positive reviews. The poll found 61 percent of voters felt he had done a good job of dealing with the coronavirus, while only 28 percent said he’d done a bad job. Additionally, 46 percent of voters said they trusted Murphy more than Ciattarelli to handle the pandemic, compared with just 21 percent who preferred Ciattarelli on the issue (17 percent said they’d handle it equally well). Ciattarelli, for his part, has tried to dampen Murphy’s edge on handling COVID-19 by <a href="https://hudsoncountyview.com/in-bayonne-ciattarelli-hits-murphy-over-covid-19-decisions-says-he-supports-vaccine-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacking the governor</a> over nursing home deaths due to the disease.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But for Ciattarelli to have a real chance, he will have to win over a large chunk of the 37 percent of New Jerseyans <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/assets/pdf/svrs-reports/2021/2021-0518-voter-registration-by-county.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who are independent voters</a>, compared with the 39 percent who are Democrats and the 22 percent who are Republicans. And at this point, Murphy leads with independents, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nj_081821.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per Monmouth</a>. Whether Ciattarelli will be able to make inroads with this group is unclear, too. The plurality of independent voters (37 percent) named COVID-19 as a top issue, which Murphy polls well on, and Ciattarelli, who <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2021/06/01/nj-republican-gubernatorial-primary-ciatterelli-singh-murphy-trump/7471971002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once had a reputation as an old-school Republican</a> in the state legislature, may alienate independent voters by <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/charles-stile/2021/08/10/nj-republicans-jack-ciattarelli-diane-allen-embrace-trump/5538347001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubling down on his party’s Trumpist base</a>. For instance, Ciattarelli opposes Murphy’s mask mandate for children in schools and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/new-jersey-governor-race-20210906.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has falsely stated</a> that masks hinder <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/benefits-of-kids-wearing-masks-in-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">children’s development</a>, although Monmouth’s poll found 67 percent of New Jersey voters support their state’s mask mandate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the two gubernatorial elections this fall, New Jersey is definitely the undercard event. Yet, while New Jersey is a bluer state than Virginia, Murphy would be the first Democratic governor to win reelection <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/06/no-surprise-here-murphy-officially-wins-democratic-nomination-as-he-runs-for-re-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since Brendan Byrne in 1977</a>. To stop Murphy from pulling this off, Ciattarelli likely needs Biden’s standing to worsen and some of his attacks against Murphy to stick.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The U.S. Census Bureau released a surprising finding in their August announcement of 2020 census results: The number of Americans who identify as multiracial <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped 276 percent over the last decade</a>. Then again, depending on how you count, the share of Americans that identify as white <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/22/1029609786/2020-census-data-results-white-population-shrinking-decline-non-hispanic-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">either rose 2 percent — or dropped 9 percent</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Racial identity is not always easily captured by checkboxes. That’s why we’re hoping to talk with Americans who either feel like the census doesn’t wholly capture their racial identity or identify as a member of one or more racial and ethnic groups. To be sure, <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2021/08/measuring-racial-ethnic-diversity-2020-census.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that can mean a lot of different things</a>, as each person has a unique background and culture that makes his or her story special, but we are particularly interested in talking to people who feel their racial identity is disconnected from what they must put on the census, people who have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/05/millions-of-americans-changed-their-racial-or-ethnic-identity-from-one-census-to-the-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed their racial or ethnic identity</a> over the last decade, and multiracial people with some white ancestry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here are some examples of experiences we’re interested in learning about: Are you Arab American or Iranian American, but <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-census-middle-east-north-africa-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compelled to check “white”</a> on the census? Or were you born to parents who identify with different racial groups? Have you <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/05/millions-of-americans-changed-their-racial-or-ethnic-identity-from-one-census-to-the-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed your racial or ethnic identity</a> over the last decade? And finally, how does the census still fall short of accurately categorizing how you identify? We’re interested in unpacking this and how America’s racial categories have changed over time — especially as to what that means for our growing population. So we want to hear from you. Fill out the survey below, and tell us a bit about yourself, your family and how you would categorize and describe your racial identity. Sharing your thoughts with us will help guide our reporting on changing racial demographics in America. We may also reach out with follow up questions to learn more about how you think about racial identity. We look forward to hearing from you</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday is election day in California as Gov. Gavin Newsom faces a recall, only <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/13/1036533187/californias-newsom-is-only-the-4th-governor-to-face-a-recall-vote">the fourth gubernatorial recall election in U.S. history</a>. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew checks in on the recall and other upcoming races and discusses how former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of one particular candidate is shaping the Wyoming primary. They also talk about surveys on Democrats’ $3.5 trillion social policy and climate change bill and whether they are a good or bad use of polling. Later in the show, FiveThirtyEight senior writers Maggie Koerth and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux come on to talk about President Biden’s sweeping vaccine mandate, how Americans <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccines-mandates-work-but-theyre-messy-business/">feel about vaccine mandates in general</a>, how effective they are and whether Biden’s is legal.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s future will be decided by California voters in only <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/governor-recall-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fourth recall election of a governor</a> in U.S. history. The vote comes after a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/californias-gavin-newsom-will-likely-face-a-recall-election-but-hell-probably-survive-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wave of criticism</a> over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/california-voters-should-start-preparing-for-a-recall-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">months of signature gathering</a> by Newsom’s opponents, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gavin-newsom-has-reason-to-worry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July’s official pronunciation of a recall election</a> and then a two-and-a-half-month campaign sprint to determine whether Newsom should be recalled and, if so, who should replace him as California’s next governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The polls suggest the recall vote is more likely to fail than succeed, but it’s still possible Newsom won’t survive. Whether he continues to hold the state’s top job in Sacramento will affect the state’s governance, its response to COVID-19 and perhaps even the Democrats’ razor-thin majority in the U.S. Senate. Here, then, is a look at the state of the recall polls, who could replace Newsom as governor if he’s recalled and what the fallout might be.</p>


<div>
<p></p><h2>The recall election</h2>
</div>


<p data-paragraph="main">According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/california-recall-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight polling average</a> of the first question on the recall ballot — whether to remove Newsom from office — 41.6 percent of Californians want to recall Newsom, while 56.2 percent want to keep him in office. </p>


<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/california-recall-polls/" target="_blank">
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2014" height="928" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-recall-avg-0912.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-recall-avg-0912.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-recall-avg-0912.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-recall-avg-0912.jpg?w=1400 2x"></figure></a>


<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s important to note that this is <em>not</em> a forecast of what will happen (like those we issue for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">midterm elections</a>); it’s just a description of what the polls have said. Usually, a 14.7-percentage-point polling lead is pretty safe, but this election isn’t usual, so some caution is warranted. This is a particularly challenging race to poll accurately because it’s hard to estimate who’s likely to vote. That’s due to two things in particular: the odd timing of the election (September of an odd-numbered year) and the fact that it is being conducted primarily by mail. In other words, don’t be surprised if there’s a larger-than-usual polling error. Indeed, as CNN’s Harry Enten has observed, the polling average of the previous gubernatorial recall election in California (in 2003) missed the final result <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/03/politics/newsom-rising-polls-recall/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 9 points</a>, and the “true” margin of error of polls of recent U.S. House special elections (which, like this recall, have been oddly timed) is around <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/01/politics/five-reasons-conor-lamb-could-win/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 points</a>. At the same time, as Enten <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/recall-election-california-newsom-final-polls/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote over the weekend</a>, there have been only four gubernatorial races since 1998 (out of 243) where the polling average missed by 15 points or more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, our assessment is that Newsom is a clear favorite to prevail. While an upset wouldn’t be unprecedented, it would qualify as a historically large polling miss.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/catching-california-recall-election-start-fivethirtyeight-79943773</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">For much of August, the recall looked like a legitimate toss-up,<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was partly due to &lt;a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=36cdcb0b-7cfa-4b55-8704-d1f02a9fe6e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one outlier poll&lt;/a&gt; from SurveyUSA that showed Californians in favor of recalling Newsom, 51 percent to 40 percent. SurveyUSA has &lt;a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=f054d152-ceac-48dc-a422-2f22c7a00521" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;since acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that the wording of their likely-voter question “may have led some respondents opposed to the recall to misidentify themselves as being unlikely to vote.” However, even without that SurveyUSA poll, our polling average would have still shown the recall failing by fewer than 4 points as late as Aug. 21, due to &lt;a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/newsom-clings-to-lead-in-recall-while-crime-becomes-a-top-issue-for-ca-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other polls&lt;/a&gt; around that time that &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-vaccinated-say-unvaccinated-add-risk-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;showed a close race&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>24</sup></a> but polls have since found Newsom’s lead expanding in the final few weeks. This could be thanks to the stunning amount of money that Newsom and his allies have poured into the campaign during this time: In August alone, they spent <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-09-04/recall-newsom-spending-elder-cox-faulconer-kiley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $36 million</a> on TV ads, digital ads, canvassing, phone banking and text banking. More broadly, it could just be that California voters are finally starting to tune into the election. Ballots were mailed to every registered voter on Aug. 16, which may have activated more voters and made the electorate <a href="https://twitter.com/williamjordann/status/1435642708417208321?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more representative</a> of California’s overall (Democratic-leaning) population. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, many summer polls that showed a close race did so because Republicans were <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6rz4s037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much likelier than Democrats</a> to say they were certain to vote in the election. How does a Republican win in a solid-blue state like California? In a very low-turnout scenario where most Democrats abstain from voting. But that seems increasingly less likely, based on data on who has voted so far. According to the California firm <a href="https://www.politicaldata.com/2021-special-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political Data, Inc.</a>, 7,799,192 mail ballots have already been returned, 52 percent of which were cast by registered Democrats, 25 percent of which were cast by registered Republicans and 23 percent of which were cast by unaffiliated voters. Please, please <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-read-too-much-into-early-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t read too much</a> into these numbers — there’s no guarantee that registered Democrats are voting against the recall (or registered Republicans for it), and in-person voters will likely be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-absentee-voting-looked-like-in-all-50-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately Republican</a>. Still, it sure doesn’t look like Democrats have an enthusiasm problem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">California’s base partisanship is one reason why this recall looks unlikely to follow the pattern of the one in 2003, when Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was recalled by <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2003&amp;fips=6&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0&amp;minper=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 points</a>. The Golden State is simply much bluer than it was 18 years ago. John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, won California by just <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2004&amp;fips=6&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0Fewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 points</a>, but President Biden carried it by <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=6&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 points</a> last year. And, crucially, while there has been some grumbling over Newsom’s governorship (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-31/newsom-covid-19-criticism-democrats-allies-possible-recall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even from Democrats</a>), he’s nowhere near as unpopular as Davis was in 2003. As the chart below shows, Newsom’s approval rating has hovered around 50 percent among likely voters in surveys conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California in the leadup to the recall, whereas the same pollster found Davis below 30 percent approval among the likely electorate before the 2003 recall contest.</p>

<p></p><h2>The replacement election</h2>
</div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Should a majority of voters choose to recall Newsom, the ballot’s second question would then come into play: Who should replace Newsom? Out of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-04/california-governor-recall-election-candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 candidates on the ballot</a>, the winner would simply be the one with the most votes, no matter how small a percentage of the vote they have. And the way things are shaping up, the winner of the replacement vote will fall <em>well</em> short of a majority — and likely get far fewer votes than Newsom does on the first question, even if the recall succeeds. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican Larry Elder, a <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/2021/08/newsom-recall-candidates-larry-elder-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative radio talk-show host</a>, has a clear lead (despite <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/kfile-larry-elder-sexual-harassment-allegations/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegations of sexual harassment</a> and his ex-fiancée’s claims that he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/19/elders-ex-fiancee-said-he-brandished-a-gun-at-her-506286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brandished a gun at her</a> during an argument), but he is polling at just shy of 28 percent in FiveThirtyEight’s tracker, well ahead of Democrat and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-03/kevin-paffrath-youtube-star-democrat-recall-candidate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube celebrity</a> Kevin Paffrath, who is at 7 percent, and two other Republicans, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and 2018 GOP gubernatorial nominee John Cox, who are both right around 5 percent.</p>



<figure><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/california-recall-polls/"><img loading="lazy" width="2058" height="984" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-2-recall-0912.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-2-recall-0912.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-2-recall-0912.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-2-recall-0912.jpg?w=1400 2x"></a></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Now, when push comes to shove, Elder might win more than 28 percent because the pool of voters who cast a replacement vote (the second question) could be notably smaller than the recall electorate (the first question), so Elder’s vote total might represent a bigger slice of that smaller pie. That’s because many Democratic-leaning voters may skip the second question in response to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-09/newsom-wants-voters-to-skip-the-recall-ballots-second-part-they-dont-have-to" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicit encouragement from Newsom’s campaign</a> to vote “no” on recall and not to cast <em>any </em>vote for a replacement candidate. Additionally, there aren’t any high-profile Democrats running to attract Democratic-leaning voters, because <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/california-s-recall-democrats-would-rather-not-have-backup-plan-n1268182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state party discouraged</a> big names from running so that Newsom’s recall would be less palatable. In a <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2021/9_8_2021_ca_statewide_marginals_a_pdftxt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University poll</a> released last week, 44 percent of likely voters said they would leave the second question blank, including 61 percent of Democrats compared with only 14 percent of Republicans. As a result, Elder attracted 39 percent of the likely voters who said they would cast a replacement vote, but that worked out to only 18 percent of all likely recall voters. In 2003, there were about 4 percent fewer votes cast for the replacement candidates than on the recall question, but it seems likely the undervote will be much larger this time around.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even if Elder’s vote share does end up being higher than 28 percent, it’s clear there is no 2021 replacement candidate with the kind of broad support Arnold Schwarzenegger attracted in 2003, <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2003&amp;fips=6&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0&amp;minper=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when he won the vote</a> to replace Davis with about 49 percent in a <em>135-candidate</em> field. In fact, because of the unusual recall-replacement format, Elder could win with the lowest vote share of any elected governor in modern times. As the chart below shows, over the past half century or so under any electoral format, no governor has won with less than 30 percent of the vote -- a feat Elder could conceivably accomplish if Newsom is recalled.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="No one has won a U.S. governorship with under 30%" aria-label="chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DyHRO/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="477" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The lowest vote share for an elected governor dating back to 1968 was 33 percent, which then-Democrat Buddy Roemer garnered to win Louisiana’s all-party primary for governor in 1987, as fellow Democrat Edwin Edwards <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1987/10/26/edwards-cuts-his-losses/58bba235-c2d5-40e1-8bc2-fbdec9612688/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined to contest a runoff against Roemer</a> after no candidate won a majority.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roemer switched parties to become a Republican during his subsequent term in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> In a regular general election, the lowest win percentage was 35 percent, which Angus King won in <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1994&amp;fips=23&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maine’s 1994 gubernatorial race</a> as an independent. And if Elder were to win with 30 percent or less, he’d actually have the lowest winner’s vote share in any gubernatorial race since 1900, surpassing Democrat Ernest Lister’s 31 percent in <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/results_report.aspx?e=125&amp;c=&amp;c2=&amp;t=&amp;t2=&amp;p=&amp;p2=&amp;y=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington’s 1912 election</a>.</p>


<div>
<p></p><h2>The potential fallout</h2>
</div>


<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve spent so much time looking ahead to the recall election itself that not a lot of ink has been spilled about what the result could mean for the future of California — and national — politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Newsom is recalled (or even if the recall does better than expected), Republicans will undoubtedly claim they have the momentum going into the 2022 midterms. It’s unclear, though, how predictive a gubernatorial recall election is of future elections. True, if one party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently overperforms</a> in special elections for Congress, it usually means that party will do well in the next November election. But the result of a <em>single</em> special election should <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-special-election-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never be overinterpreted</a>; there might have been local issues at play or extenuating circumstances that made that one race a poor bellwether for the nation as a whole. And recall elections are especially prone to extenuating circumstances since something seismic and unusual must have happened to get them on the ballot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plus, special elections for Congress are federal elections, meaning partisanship plays a bigger role in how people vote; by contrast, it’s not unheard of for a state to elect a governor from the party opposite to how it usually votes in presidential races. And there is such a small sample of gubernatorial recall elections in U.S. history that it’s impossible to know whether they have any predictive power, anyway. The 2003 recall of Davis possibly foreshadowed a good 2004 election for Republicans — the 51 percent of the national popular vote that then-President George W. Bush received is still the highest for a Republican in over 30 years — but former Gov. Scott Walker’s victory in the June 2012 recall election in Wisconsin didn’t presage then-President Barack Obama’s reelection victory later that year, in which he carried Wisconsin by <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2012&amp;fips=55&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 points</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Electoral impacts aside, the recall result could really matter in terms of policy. If Elder were to become governor, that would surely have ramifications for the state’s response to COVID-19 and its politics more broadly. Most immediately, directives from the governor’s office on battling the coronavirus could shift sharply away from the status quo. Elder <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-recall-larry-elder-repeal-mask-vaccine-mandates-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has promised</a> to repeal Newsom’s mask and vaccine mandates if he wins, and he’s also <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/larry-elder-dismisses-covid-19-175827910.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed opposition</a> to having young people get vaccinated or wear masks in school. This comes despite a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I50LLKPg-nOZdhn8Qa7zziU3i1MZl3SD/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov survey last month</a> that found around two-thirds of Californians backed vaccine mandates for health workers and even employees of private businesses.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, <a href="https://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/c.php?g=275786&amp;p=6904274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California governors can</a> fill vacancies in state courts and in various executive departments. As such, Elder could try to appoint conservative justices to California’s courts and place conservative officials in state government. He would also have line-item veto power on appropriations bills, which could enable Elder to seek funding cuts for programs he doesn’t support. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, a Gov. Elder <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-09-03/california-recall-larry-elder-governor-powerless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have limitless power</a> to reshape California in his image. Most importantly, Democrats still have supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature, meaning they would be able to override his vetoes of any bills they want to pass. And any judges Elder appoints would have to be confirmed by the state’s Commission on Judicial Appointments. Finally, an Elder governorship might not last long because the office will be on the ballot again in November 2022. Given California’s blue hue, it’s very possible that, even if Newsom is recalled, the state will have a Democratic governor again in just 16 months.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s one lurking and potentially momentous appointment that Elder could make without being overruled: <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate637302453.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filling a vacancy in the U.S. Senate</a>. It’s not hard to construct a scenario in which an Elder victory could lead to a power shift in Washington, either, since Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/F000062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is 88 years old</a> and the chamber is currently divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote giving Democrats a narrow hold on power. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-elder-dianne-feinstein-replace-republican-california-recall-election-senate-2021-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elder pledged to appoint a Republican</a> in Feinstein’s place (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/upshot/democrats-agenda-hinges-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should her seat become vacant</a>), which would give Republicans a 51-49 edge in the Senate. How long Elder would even have this power is hard to say, though, as Democrats could use their supermajorities in the state legislature to change the state’s Senate vacancy rules to prevent this scenario from happening.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, one consequence of the recall election — regardless of the result — could be alterations to the recall process itself. It’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-california-became-the-recall-capital-of-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easier for recalls to succeed</a> in California than in any other state, and it wouldn’t be surprising if the Democratic legislature tries to amend state law to discourage this from happening again. (It <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/15/california-democrats-use-budget-bill-to-change-recall-election-rules-help-colleague/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn’t be the first time</a> that Democrats <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Demcocratic-lawmakers-vote-to-speed-up-Newsom-16280554.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manipulated California’s recall process</a> for their own attempted political benefit.) There is public support for this, too: According to a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/b1h1g2vgfh/recall_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Hoover Institute/Bill Lane Center for the American West poll</a> of the recall from a couple weeks ago, a plurality of Californians favor several reforms to the recall process, including raising the number of signatures required to trigger an election, increasing the filing requirements for replacement candidates and requiring a specific reason to recall a governor.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">If you’re interested in seeing how it all shakes out — and really, why wouldn’t you be? — join us for our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a> of the recall election. Just don’t expect to learn the result on Tuesday night: Since the election is being conducted predominantly by mail, it’s going to take several days to count all the votes, just like it did in the 2020 presidential election. Last year, California counted only about two-thirds of its votes on election night, with the rest trickling in over the next several days. The state didn’t even hit 95 percent reporting until 11 days after Election Day.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It likely won’t take as long this time, since the deadline for ballots to be received is <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/statewide-elections/2021-recall/key-dates-deadlines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one week</a> after the election (in 2020, it was <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/#CA-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 days</a> after), but you should still be prepared to wait multiple days for a winner to be declared if the election is at all close.

			<title>Why It Was So Easy To Get Gavin Newsom’s Recall On The Ballot In California</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">California leads the nation in efforts to recall members of its government, but there’s no single reason for this — in fact, there are four. First, practically every public official in the state is eligible for recall. In addition, a recall petition can be triggered for any reason. California doesn’t require as many signatures as other states either, and it allows petitions to circulate longer. All these factors combine to make California’s recall process one of the most lenient in the country.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1416" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Gavin Newsom is the latest governor to face a recall attempt in the state, but he’s hardly the first. Everyone who has served as governor of California in the past 60 years has faced at least one attempted recall. But Newsom is part of a much more exclusive club with next Tuesday’s election: Qualifying a recall for the ballot is still rare, but California has seen more recalls of state legislators and governors qualify than any other state. Of the 29 recall elections for state legislators that have taken place in the U.S., nine have been in California, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials.aspx#Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>. And after Sept. 14, two of the nation’s four gubernatorial recall elections will have taken place in California.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The state’s recall procedure was enacted as a constitutional amendment over a century ago. As a Progressive Era reform, the recall — along with the initiative and the referendum, two hallmarks of California’s legislate-by-ballot system — was intended to strengthen the electorate’s power over its government. A California state senator was recalled in 1913, and with that, the recall was off to the races: There have been 178 subsequent attempts to recall elected state officials. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s been some futzing around the margins,<a data-footnote-id="41" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-41" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, for example, Californians voted to increase the amount of time between the certification of signatures and the recall election itself from 60-80 days to up to 180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>41</sup></a> but the basic mechanism for the recall of a statewide officer hasn’t changed much over the years. (Though state legislators <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SCA3https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SCA3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tried</a>, and are <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB660" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certainly</a> <a href="http://california%20leads%20the%20nation%20in%20efforts%20to%20recall%20members%20of%20its%20government,%20but%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20single%20reason%20for%20this%20--%20in%20fact,%20there%20are%20four.%20first,%20practically%20every%20public%20official%20in%20the%20state%20is%20eligible%20for%20recall.%20in%20addition,%20a%20recall%20petition%20can%20be%20triggered%20for%20any%20reason.%20california%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20require%20as%20many%20signatures%20as%20other%20states%20either,%20and%20it%20allows%20petitions%20to%20circulate%20longer.%20all%20these%20factors%20combine%20to%20make%20california%E2%80%99s%20recall%20process%20one%20of%20the%20most%20lenient%20in%20the%20country.%20insert%20chart%201%20gavin%20newsom%20is%20the%20latest%20governor%20to%20face%20a%20recall%20attempt%20in%20the%20state,%20but%20he%E2%80%99s%20hardly%20the%20first.%20everyone%20who%20has%20served%20as%20governor%20of%20california%20in%20the%20past%2060%20years%20has%20faced%20at%20least%20one%20attempted%20recall.%20though%20he%E2%80%99s%20part%20of%20a%20much%20more%20exclusive%20club%20with%20next%20tuesday%E2%80%99s%20election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still trying</a>.) Citizens bring a petition for recall to the secretary of state; they collect signatures; and if the number of certified signatures exceeds a minimum threshold, a recall election is triggered.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What makes California rife with recalls? First, all <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 states</a><a data-footnote-id="42" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-42" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, D.C. Recalling a mayor doesn’t count for the purposes of our story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>42</sup></a> with official recall processes allow the recall of a governor, but only four — including California — hold nearly all public offices eligible for recall. Many states restrict recalls to include only elected positions or specific offices, or exclude certain judges from recall attempts. No public official serving the state of California is immune, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/us/politics/judge-persky-brock-turner-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful recall of Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky</a> in 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Secondly, California does not limit the grounds for recall. If, say, someone isn’t a fan of the state Supreme Court, that empowered resident could file 18 petitions to recall nine different justices in two years.<a data-footnote-id="43" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-43" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This actually happened between 1986 and 1988. No petition successfully qualified for the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>43</sup></a> With no required burden of proof, the first step to getting a recall on the ballot is as easy as filing some paperwork — unlike in some other states, which require an indictment or criminal conviction before a recall can even be considered.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="942" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Third, the state has a fairly low signature threshold. A petitioner seeking to recall a statewide official needs to collect signatures equal to 12 percent of the last vote for office (it’s a little higher for state legislators and judges), plus signatures equal to 1 percent of the last vote from at least five of California’s 58 counties. Compared with the other two states that require a geographic distribution of signatures, California’s threshold is relatively low. Georgia requires the recall position to have a minimum number of signatures from each of its 14 congressional districts, and Illinois requires signatures from at least 25 of its 102 counties.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">To trigger a recall election for Newsom, petitioners had to collect fewer than 1.5 million signatures, a drop in a state where more than 12.7 million people voted in the last gubernatorial election. Compare that with a state like Michigan, which would require signatures equivalent to 25 percent of the 4.3 million votes cast in 2018 to put a gubernatorial recall on its ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which brings us to the fourth reason it is comparatively easier for Californians to get a recall on the ballot. Out of the 19 states with recall processes, only four prescribe a circulation period longer than five months.<a data-footnote-id="44" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-44" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Alaska nor North Dakota has a mandatory circulation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>44</sup></a> For statewide offices, California mandates a circulation period of 160 days;<a data-footnote-id="45" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-45" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsom’s recall petition was extended an additional four months due to the impact of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>45</sup></a> the majority of states limit that period to three months or less.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1014" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Yet California may not remain the nation’s most recall-friendly state for long.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">I was in my eighth grade classroom in a small town in Ontario, Canada, when suddenly there was a flurry of activity in the hallway. An instructor popped her head in the door, her face drained of color, and beckoned our teacher out of the room. Soon after, all of the seventh and eighth graders — deemed old enough to understand the gravity of the situation —  were ushered into a classroom where we watched a grainy broadcast of the news. The first plane had flown into the World Trade Center in New York City. We were sent home early. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are so few moments in history that call for the question “Where were you when you heard the news?” But the Sept. 11 attacks are undoubtedly one, and most Americans can answer that question without missing a beat. Earlier this month, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/hlzpfslijb/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov asked Americans if they could remember where they were,</a> and 81 percent said they could. In a separate poll, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/02/two-decades-later-the-enduring-legacy-of-9-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center found</a> that 93 percent of adults age 30 and over could remember. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past two decades, as pollsters have surveyed Americans on issues around terrorism and the 9/11 attacks in particular, much of the sentiment has remained consistent, a pattern identified in <a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2021-08/mueller-public-opinion-on-war-and-terror-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a white paper published in August</a> by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. In a review of public opinion polling since the 9/11 attacks, John Mueller, a senior fellow at Cato and a political scientist at Ohio State University, found that much of the public’s opinions about terrorism and safety have remained steady for two decades. In some cases, concerns spiked immediately following the attacks, then declined slightly before staying static for years. In other cases, the rates of concern never declined. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“These findings are rather surprising because there is reason to have expected that concerns and anxieties about terrorism would erode over time,” Mueller wrote. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/911-era-political-consensus-impossible-days-79884213</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">For example, Americans have remained convinced that a terrorist attack is likely. A series of polls from The Economist/YouGov conducted from 2013 to 2021<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouGov also posed this question in 2009. Also, four of the polls we analyzed were conducted by YouGov alone, without sponsorship of The Economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> asked what Americans think are the chances of a terrorist attack in the U.S. in the next 12 months. Those who thought an attack was “very” or “somewhat” likely rarely dipped below 50 percent and often spiked following major terrorist attacks in the U.S. or Europe. (Any time the responses rose about 70 percent, it was following a major attack.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, Pew’s annual survey of policy priorities has found <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/02/two-decades-later-the-enduring-legacy-of-9-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans rank terrorism</a> at or near the top of the list year over year. As recently as 2020, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/02/13/as-economic-concerns-recede-environmental-protection-rises-on-the-publics-policy-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74 percent of Americans</a> said defending against terrorism should be a top priority for the president and Congress, making it the number-one policy issue. Even in 2021, as the pandemic altered priorities, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/01/28/economy-and-covid-19-top-the-publics-policy-agenda-for-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63 percent of Americans</a> still rated terrorism as their top issue, making it fourth overall, behind the pandemic, the economy and jobs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans also consistently say that 9/11 has had a lasting impact on this country. In <a href="https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/f1bf1e6c-a24d-4d52-a616-e05e09e6ce62/note/4f0fba7c-bb95-420e-b30e-9ddfd9f526fd.#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post/ABC News polls</a> from 2001, 2002, 2011 and 2021, the proportion of Americans who said the attacks “changed this country in a lasting way” has never fallen below 83 percent,  with 86 percent saying so in a survey conducted within the past month. Notably, though, the feelings on whether this is a change for the better or worse has shifted: In 2002, 67 percent of Americans said that the 9/11 attacks changed America for the better. That number has declined since, with only 33 percent saying so in 2021. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That 9/11 still rests so heavily on our collective consciousness is no surprise. For those of us who lived through it, we just have to cast our minds back to that day. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Abortion rights remain top of mind for many Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/">in the wake of the Supreme Court</a> allowing a Texas law that effectively bans abortions in the state to go into effect. The percentage of Americans who say “abortion, contraception and equal pay”<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite the grouping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> are their top voting concern has risen since the decision, according to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/07/women-abortion-texas-law-top-issue/">a Morning Consult poll</a> from Sept. 4-6. Overall, 6 percent of voters said this was their top issue after the decision, compared with 4 percent before, while support among Democrats doubled, fueled by a 6-percentage-point jump among Democratic women.</li><li>Canada and Germany are heading to the polls to vote for new leaders and parliaments this month. In Germany, the center-left Social Democratic Party is leading the polls, sitting at an average of 25 percent, ahead of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party), at 21 percent, according to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/">Politico’s poll tracker</a>. And in Canada, the center-right Conservative Party has edged ahead of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party, with their respective polling averages at 33.5 percent and 31.6 percent, according to <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/">CBC’s poll tracker</a>. However, the Liberals are still favored to win the most seats — though another minority government is likely, regardless of who wins. </li><li>Though <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-end-of-the-afghanistan-war-and-bidens-handling-of-it-so-far/">Americans overall have somewhat mixed feelings</a> about the decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, when you ask Americans who were deployed in that war, there’s a higher level of consensus. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/09/afghanistan-war-veterans-polling/">An Aug. 17-Sept. 2 Morning Consult poll of veterans</a> of the war in Afghanistan found 58 percent supported President Biden’s decision to withdraw troops, with 53 percent still supporting the decision even if the Taliban is in control of Afghanistan, and 53 percent supporting even if it creates an opportunity for terrorists in Afghanistan. </li><li>The decision to get vaccinated against COVID-19 has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-arent-new-to-the-anti-vaxx-movement/">become an increasingly partisan</a> issue in the U.S., and it can sometimes make for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/03/08/vaccine-anti-vax-anti-vaxxer-what-change-their-mind-vaccine-hesitancy/3100216002/">some cognitive dissonance</a> between a person’s political identity and their personal health choices: <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/secret-vaxxers-these-americans-are-getting-covid-vaccinations-but-not-telling-anyone/">A Harris/USA Today</a> poll conducted between Aug. 27-29 found that 11 percent of vaccinated Americans said they would keep their vaccination a secret from some people, and 6 percent said they didn’t plan to tell anyone.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">At first glance, Melissa<a data-footnote-id="46" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-46" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa is not her real name. She requested a pseudonym because she is concerned her beliefs will create backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>46</sup></a> seems to meet all the criteria of the “crunchy granola” type. She tracks ingredients on all the products she buys and uses apps to identify anything that isn’t “clean.” She says she considers herself vaccine-hesitant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m not against vaccines for everyone,” she wrote to me in a Facebook Messenger chat. “[But] I’m very distrustful of pharmaceutical companies and that is the main reason I am hesitant about vaccines for myself and my family.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But she’s not exactly left-wing. A nurse-midwife student in Nebraska, Melissa said she’s libertarian, and while there are ideas on the left and right she agrees with, her main political position is that “the government shouldn’t be regulating things that don’t hurt others.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The modern anti-vaccination movement in America has <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/06/the-anti-vax-movements-radical-shift-from-crunchy-granola-purists-to-far-right-crusaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often been associated</a> with a stereotype of left-wing, coastal, white, wealthy moms — those “crunchy granola” types. In recent years, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, spurred by low vaccination rates in children, emerged in wealthy, liberal places like <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/20/whooping-cough-cases-spike-again-in-marin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marin County, California</a>, and <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/some-families-make-controversial-decision-not-to-vaccinate-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boulder, Colorado</a>. But while the public narrative focused on these left-wing enclaves, they were far from the only regions affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease: <a href="https://khn.org/news/why-measles-hits-so-hard-within-n-y-orthodox-jewish-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conservative communities of Orthodox Jews</a>, some of whom also reject vaccines, have also seen spikes in cases, for example. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/Health/video/covid-19-vaccines-work-74654465</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And polls over the past two decades have consistently found Republicans are just as likely as Democrats to hold vaccine-hesitant views. So while the right-wing resistance to the COVID-19 vaccines may feel like an about-face for who is anti-vax in America, both sides of the political divide were always there — but now one side’s fringe views have slipped into its mainstream. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Vaccine refusal has always been a place where left meets right,” said Jennifer Reich, a sociology professor at the University of Colorado and the author of “Calling the Shots: Why Parents Reject Vaccines.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though anti-vaxxers have been around as long as vaccines, the modern anti-vaccination movement really emerged after the 1998 publication of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/lancet-retracts-mmr-paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an infamous and since-retracted study</a> in The Lancet that falsely claimed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine caused autism. In the years that followed — spurred partly by support from <a href="https://www.insider.com/jenny-mccarthy-became-the-face-of-the-anti-vaxx-movement-2019-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy</a> — a new era of vaccine fears began, with small but fierce <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/01/30/84-of-kindergartners-not-up-to-date-on-vaccines-at-a-marin-school-majority-of-students-unprotected-at-some-private-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cohorts of parents refusing to vaccinate</a> their children. And polling has consistently shown those small cohorts included Americans on the left and the right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take a series of polls from Gallup, conducted in 2001, 2015 and 2019. Each time, Gallup asked respondents the same questions about vaccines, and while there was always anti-vaccine representation across the political spectrum, the most recent poll showed a spike in the adoption of anti-vaccine views among Republicans and independents. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Republicans and independents are increasingly anti-vaxx" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/C63Yn/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="233" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">When asked how important it is that parents vaccinate their children, very few or no respondents said it was “not very” or “not at all” important in earlier surveys. But in 2019, 8 percent of Republicans, 8 percent of independents and 2 percent of Democrats said it was “not very” or “not at all” important that parents vaccinate their kids. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which side of the political aisle was <em>more</em> anti-vaccine really depends on the question and the poll. In <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/63g3p232e0/tabs_Vaccines_0716172013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2013 YouGov poll</a>, 11 percent of Democrats, 14 percent of independents and 9 percent of Republicans said they believe vaccines cause autism. But in <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/rat7jsde5z/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2017 YouGov poll</a>, 19 percent of Democrats, 31 percent of independents and 39 percent of Republicans said it was “definitely” or “probably” true that vaccines cause autism. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/02/09/83-percent-say-measles-vaccine-is-safe-for-healthy-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 Pew Research Center poll</a> found 9 percent of Democrats, 10 percent of independents and 5 percent of Republicans thought the MMR vaccine was unsafe. And in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-on-vaccines-and-the-measles-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2015 CBS poll</a>, when asked whether parents should be required to vaccinate their kids or should be able to decide for themselves, 38 percent of Republicans, 34 percent of independents and 23 percent of Democrats said parents should be able to make their own choice. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked about vaccine safety, Republicans and Democrats express vaccine-hesitant beliefs at roughly the same rate. But when asked about government mandates, Republicans are much more likely to take the vaccine-hesitant stance, according to Allan McCoy, a sociology professor at State University of New York. In a 2018 study published in Critical Public Health<em>, </em>McCoy compared two Pew Center surveys on vaccine beliefs. He found that the more ideologically extreme a respondent was — regardless of whether they’re on the left or right —  the more likely they were to think that vaccines are unsafe. But when asked if vaccines should be compulsory or left up to parents, respondents who identified as “very conservative” were 136 percent more likely than “moderates” to think it should be a parent’s choice, while those who were “liberal” and “very liberal”  were 44 percent and 13 percent <em>less</em> likely to think so, respectively. Democrats and Republicans are almost equally likely to hold anti-vaccine beliefs, but Republicans in particular <em>also</em> tend to be against vaccine mandates.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But if vaccine hesitancy before the pandemic was relatively bipartisan, vaccine hesitancy around the COVID-19 vaccine has been anything but. Polls and vaccination rates <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-is-growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have shown Republicans are less likely to be vaccinated</a>, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/03/05/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-plan-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-or-already-have/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to say they don’t plan to get the shot</a> than Democrats. Shana Kushner Gadarian, a political science professor at Syracuse University, and her colleagues have been conducting a panel survey of 3,000 Americans for the past 18 months. Gadarian told me there has been a partisan split on all health behaviors (not only the vaccine but also mask wearing, hand washing, visiting one’s doctor) throughout the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Partisanship is not the sole determinant, but it is the strongest, most consistent determinant, even controlling for age, education, where people are living, how many COVID-19 cases are in the area,” Gadarian said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This split over the COVID-19 vaccine reflects <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/17/politics-is-wrecking-americas-pandemic-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the politicization of the entire pandemic</a>, but what does it mean for the demographics of the anti-vaxx movement beyond COVID-19? Experts I spoke to said it’s too early to tell, and so far there hasn’t been enough recent polling on non-COVID-19 vaccine beliefs to be definitive. In <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/xj7rpmvws8/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July 2019 YouGov poll</a>, for instance, 14 percent of Democrats, 21 percent of independents and 28 percent of Republicans said it’s “definitely” or “probably” true that vaccines have been shown to cause autism. When YouGov <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/w2zmwpzsq0/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posed the same question this past July</a>, 11 percent of Democrats, 18 percent of independents and 27 percent of Republicans said so. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a chance some left-wing anti-vaxxers will second-guess their stance given the sudden embrace of anti-vaccine positions on the right. But Reich, who studied vaccine-hesitant parents for years, said they typically don’t identify as “anti-vaccine,” per se, and feel more strongly about their ideals — like that a parent is the best person to make decisions about their child’s health — than their identity. So having Republicans espousing similar beliefs won’t feel like a challenge for left-wing parents, necessarily. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, it’s possible that Republican resistance to the COVID-19 vaccine could mutate into vaccine hesitancy more generally, if one’s political identity demands resistance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m worried that the politicization could threaten the social consensus [currently] in favor of vaccination,” said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. “If we start to see attitudes towards vaccines become closely linked to partisanship and ideology, we could see a polarization over vaccination that would threaten herd immunity on a whole series of diseases over time.”  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From her point of view, Melissa said the idea that Republicans may become more broadly vaccine hesitant isn’t just a hypothesis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I know for a fact, based on a group chat I am in, that some Republicans are reevaluating their stance on all vaccines,” she wrote.</p>
