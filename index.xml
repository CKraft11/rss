<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been over a year and a half since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">All-out partisan conflict has jammed the gears in the U.S. Senate in recent years, causing a virtual standstill. We’ve seen the Republican Party <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/29/624467256/what-happened-with-merrick-garland-in-2016-and-why-it-matters-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block a presidential nominee to the Supreme Court</a> without a hearing or vote. We’ve seen both parties <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/cloture/clotureCounts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly use the filibuster</a> when they’re in the minority to impede the opposition from passing legislation. And <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R43389.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve seen a ratcheting up</a> of brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, which <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/debt-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establishes how much money the federal government can borrow</a> to pay its existing financial obligations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The use of the debt ceiling as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-debt-deal-the-triumph-of-the-old-washington/2011/08/02/gIQARSFfqI_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislative hostage</a> started in earnest in 2011, when a divided government in Washington <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/the-not-so-happy-anniversary-of-the-debt-ceiling-crisis/260458/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly caused a debt default</a>. Energized by the tea party movement, Republicans <a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/a-familiar-landmine-the-looming-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to back an increase in the debt ceiling</a> unless then-President Barack Obama agreed to budget cuts, and they also refused to raise taxes as part of a bipartisan bargain. A last-minute agreement followed, but the delay still led to a downgrade in the country’s credit rating. Yet we’ve seen <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/debt-limit-through-the-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued clashes over the cap ever since</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those conflicts have escalated further in the current round. Although Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/us/politics/debt-ceiling-congress-republicans.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have just about reached a deal</a> to go ahead with a simple majority vote on a short-term debt ceiling increase, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-republicans-refusing-raise-debt-ceiling/story?id=80394658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans remain intent on filibustering</a> a straight up-or-down vote on a longer-term suspension or increase of the limit in December. Democrats control the Senate, which is split 50-50, through Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote. But that’s well short of the 60 votes required by the filibuster to advance to a final vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“What I see as new here is filibustering debt limit increases and forcing a Senate majority party that doesn’t have 60 seats to try to come up with some way to raise the debt ceiling — even though it doesn’t have 60 seats and can’t get any help from the minority party,” said <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/frances-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frances Lee</a>, a political scientist at Princeton University who studies congressional politics.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-passing-bidens-agenda-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80405623</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Failing to raise the debt limit would result in a default on U.S. debt, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/01/economy/debt-ceiling-next-steps/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could cripple the economy</a> and <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling#_Hlk431978571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause terrible repercussions for everyday Americans</a>. The date the country runs out of money is quickly approaching: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/treasury-secretary-warns-calamity-congress-raise-debt-limit/story?id=80283655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> it could be as soon as Oct. 18. While the parties seem set on a short-term agreement to push that deadline back to at least December, Republicans continue to say that, for a longer-term increase, Democrats <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-play-debt-limit-brinksmanship-nation-barrels-default/story?id=80417215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must raise the cap on their own</a> using the more complex <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reconciliation process</a>, which allows passage of certain fiscal legislation with only a simple majority. And, while there are paths out of this predicament, this amplified disagreement is emblematic of the dangers the debt ceiling presents to our political system, especially <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when partisan enmity is so high</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here, then, is a look at how we got here; what could prevent politicians from using the debt ceiling to put Congress in a political stranglehold; and why it’s unlikely that the debt ceiling will go away anytime soon.</p>

<h2><strong>How the battle over the debt ceiling escalated</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Congress has always placed limits on federal debt, but it <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling#established" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first established the debt ceiling</a> in 1917 over concerns about debt piling up during World War I. About two decades later, in 1939, <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20151102_RL31967_4040b7fa5a66b382fbc01594e94477dfa8bacf46.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the cap came into its modern form</a> after modifications applied it to nearly all federal debt. The idea was that aggregating most debt would give the Treasury Department more flexibility to manage it while maintaining Congress’s <a href="https://history.house.gov/institution/origins-development/power-of-the-purse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">constitutionally mandated control of the nation’s finances</a>. Over time, the state of the debt ceiling has also come to symbolize the federal government’s frugality or wastefulness.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the limit’s means as a check on spending is questionable considering that the national debt <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYGFD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only gone up</a> since the late 1930s. More importantly, as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product, debt has surged since the 1980s, following a long-running decrease after World War II, as the chart below shows. In other words, the country’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtgdpratio.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debt-to-GDP ratio</a> — a measure of our debt that factors in our ability to pay it off by looking at it relative to the size of the nation’s economy — has grown immensely.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Both Republicans and Democrats own the national debt  " aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z8PQ5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Who’s to blame? Well, both parties, and … circumstances. The steepest rises in debt-to-GDP ratio came during the presidencies of two Republicans (Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump) and one Democrat (Barack Obama). However, some of these increases happened partly because of crises. When Obama came into office during the Great Recession, a loss of tax revenues due to the economic downturn and a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$831 billion stimulus package</a> led to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/06/25/10-years-later-4-fiscal-policy-lessons-from-the-global-financial-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large budget deficits</a>. And in 2020, during Trump’s presidency, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/government-stimulus-efforts-to-fight-the-covid-19-crisis-4799723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stimulus efforts to combat</a> the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a further rise. Yet much of this was of their own making, such as the <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tax-cuts-wont-make-america-great-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax cuts passed</a> during the presidencies of Reagan and Trump that ballooned deficits and increased the national debt.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s never been an easy vote, but Congress has raised the debt ceiling more than 100 times. Its history as a political tinderbox <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/146682/1/862691109.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long predates our current era</a>. “The debt ceiling has been a problem going back to the 1950s, because it’s difficult for Congress to support an increase,” said Lee. “It looks to their constituents like they are free spending, don't care about the deficit, that they're voting themselves a blank check. That's how it gets understood.” This misunderstanding of the debt ceiling -- which affects only our ability to pay what we already owe -- <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-fight-over-the-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to be a problem</a>, too, as many Americans still mistakenly believe it authorizes new spending.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s different in the latest debt-ceiling fight</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Prior to this current fight, if one party had full control but lacked 60 seats in the Senate, the minority party <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn’t block the majority from advancing</a> debt ceiling legislation. With a looming deal to allow a short-term increase, that has remained true -- for now. But later this year, Republican opposition may compel Democrats to raise the cap on their own <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/22/potential-fallback-for-debt-ceiling-fraught-with-complications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using reconciliation</a>, a special legislative process that requires just a simple majority but can only be used sparingly. While <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/27/democrats-reject-grueling-debt-limit-514256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not unheard of</a> to increase the limit via reconciliation, having the minority <em>force</em> the majority to raise it this way is new.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/laura-blessing-ph-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Blessing</a>, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute who studies budgetary politics, viewed this fight as potentially “a new era of just insane levels of brinkmanship” because there doesn’t appear to be any path to a bipartisan agreement on a long-term debt ceiling increase. Blessing noted that it was then-Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who came together at the last minute to salvage things in 2011. But McConnell “has changed his tune in terms of how he thinks the debt ceiling should work,” she observed, as he now argues the party in power has sole responsibility for raising it. “And there is not, at least not publicly, any sort of negotiating position that [Republicans are] using this for,” said Blessing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It seems that de facto, they're attempting to slow down the Biden administration legislative train by putting this kind of a roadblock in the works. It’s just the most dangerous roadblock that you can possibly imagine.”</p>

<h2><strong>Why it’s going to be hard to remove the debt ceiling cudgel from our politics</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we’ve seen, the debt ceiling has done little to reduce federal spending, in part because the cap affects the country’s ability to pay off already-existing financial obligations and is handled separately from legislation that actually authorizes expenditures. Additionally, the debt ceiling has provided opportunities for partisan maneuvering that can take us to the brink of default. So it’s probably past time to rethink the debt ceiling. “You've got this fiscal tool that is antiquated and can only harm people and that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22684328/us-debt-ceiling-government-shutdown-biden-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtually no other country around the world has</a>,” said Blessing. “You could procedurally blunt this.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One move would be to reinstitute some version of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-ceiling-reconciliation-partisan-budget-negotiations-spending-federal-deficit-11629753688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gephardt Rule</a>, which from 1979 to 1995 linked an increase in the debt ceiling to the passage of the budget. When Congress passed its fiscal plan, it simultaneously authorized any necessary borrowing. But after the GOP captured all of Congress in the 1994 election, it mostly did away with this rule. Unfortunately, reinstating this rule might not be enough, in part because the budgetary process <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/its-not-news-congresss-budget-process-wreck-it-should-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t functioned properly</a> for years now. “The federal budget process has been broken for the past 10 years. We have not passed a budget resolution most of the time,” observed Blessing. “So even if you went back to a classic fix, that classic fix would be a problem because things have broken down so much.” In fact, after Democrats captured the House in 2018, <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/01/03/rules-package-would-renew-gephardt-rule-with-a-major-twist-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they implemented a new version of the Gephardt Rule</a> that suspends the debt limit rather than establishing a new ceiling. That hasn’t fixed things, partly because the Senate still has to approve of the suspension. Blessing said that Senate rules could also be adjusted to include something similar to the Gephardt Rule, but that could be difficult to do in such a narrowly divided chamber.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a similar but more ambitious vein, Georgetown University law professor David Super <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/20/only-language-mcconnell-understands-is-power-act-accordingly-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has argued that</a> Senate Democrats could use a stand-alone reconciliation vote to pass legislation that directly ties the debt ceiling to whatever the national debt happens to be. And with Senate Republicans opposed to assisting a long-term debt ceiling hike, Democrats <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1445111822483345411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may indeed have to raise it</a> via reconciliation. In a bit of good news for Democrats, though, Punchbowl News <a href="https://email.punchbowl.news/t/ViewEmail/t/DD8030506F7149122540EF23F30FEDED/0D79378D1BBC29E51D419C9787CC9684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported earlier this week</a> that the Senate parliamentarian has ruled that a separate reconciliation vote on the debt ceiling wouldn’t disrupt Democrats’ ongoing legislative efforts to pass a large social spending package, which is also being done via reconciliation. Democrats could try to mimic Super’s plan or raise the debt ceiling to an astronomically high number that would essentially make it meaningless for the foreseeable future. Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, chairman of the House Budget Committee, <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/debt-creativity-includes-mint-the-coin-gazillion-dollar-limit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in late September</a> that he was in favor of “eliminating the law or raising the debt limit to a gazillion dollars.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s not clear whether Super’s approach or raising the debt ceiling to an extreme might be palatable to many Democrats, who may instead prefer a smaller increase. “It's a painful vote for members of Congress,” said Lee. “They don't want to have to vote for it because it makes them look irresponsible to their constituents.” And sure enough, Republicans are licking their chops at the prospect of using this vote in the 2022 midterms, especially by linking it to the Democrats’ ambitious spending plans. For instance, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, <a href="https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1441066579496685568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> that the committee’s midterm election ads will hit Democrats on a debt limit increase.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And therein lies the rub with the debt ceiling: It’s really a political tool, not a fiscal instrument. “A reason why it's hard to reform is that it's a valuable mechanism for forcing a conversation about deficits and gives Congress leverage to demand concessions,” said Lee. “In the case of unified government, it’s the chance for the party out of power to make some political headway against the party in power, to say they're governing in an irresponsible manner.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, even if many Democrats want to change how the debt ceiling works, Blessing pointed out that such a reform could be too much for members of Congress to take on while Democrats are also trying to pass a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-will-be-disappointed-party-pares-agenda-white-house-2021-10-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still-developing social spending plan</a>. “I don't see them having the bandwidth to do that right now,” said Blessing. “You're asking a lot of people to take votes that are going to make them a little squeamish, particularly for well-known and moderate Democrats, and asking them to deal with debt limit reform on top of that. That is kind of a big ask.” The short-term deal to raise the debt ceiling does give Democrats a little more space to work out the party’s exact social spending legislation, but it’s unclear <a href="https://email.punchbowl.news/t/ViewEmail/t/C16F789594BD16622540EF23F30FEDED/CFF70EDA230965EECE63909E3969C05F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether they’ll have enough time</a> to finish those deliberations before the debt issue once again becomes pressing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet another wrinkle is that the Republican filibuster of a long-term debt ceiling hike has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/us/debt-ceiling-filibuster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reanimated discussions</a> within the Democratic caucus over changes to the traditional filibuster. Some Democrats, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/politics/biden-debt-ceiling-filibuster/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including President Biden</a>, have raised the idea of altering the rules to allow a simple majority vote to raise the debt ceiling, or even something less specific, such as a <a href="https://twitter.com/lindsaywise/status/1445487774698672132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-day elimination of the filibuster</a>. However, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema <a href="https://www.vox.com/22319564/filibuster-reform-manchin-democrats-nuclear-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have publicly opposed</a> changes to the filibuster rules. And earlier this week, Manchin <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1445122612665933826?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed back</a> on adjusting the filibuster for a debt ceiling hike. Still, Lee wondered if there may have been some calculation by the Democratic leadership in not trying to address the debt limit earlier this year, even though everyone knew well ahead of time that the fight was coming. “This is not a surprise, so why are they letting it come to crisis now at the same time as they have to deal with the infrastructure bill and the reconciliation negotiations on the Build Back Better plan?” asked Lee. “I'm totally speculating, but it is a pressure point for the filibuster.” The filibuster’s future may have played into McConnell’s decision to yield on a short-term increase, as forcing senators such as Manchin and Sinema to choose between defending the filibuster and avoiding default <a href="https://twitter.com/LPDonovan/status/1445887228266307584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have generated</a> enough pressure to truly threaten the filibuster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, changes to the filibuster remain unlikely, and while there are other, <a href="https://www.axios.com/trillion-dollar-platinum-coin-mint-janet-yellen-223e7722-d7ba-47c9-b5f6-49a841d181de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more outrageous ideas</a> for overcoming the debt ceiling, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2014/07/20/333032601/kicking-the-can-down-the-road-a-habit-thats-hard-to-kick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not at all a surprise</a> that Congress has opted to kick the can a few feet down the road with a short-term increase. Come December, Congress will be right back at this same juncture. But as long as the debt ceiling exists in its current form, Congress will keep having these fights over raising it -- even if doing so seems to align with <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einstein-s-parable-of-quantum-insanity/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CInsanity%20is%20doing%20the%20same,usually%20attributed%20to%20Albert%20Einstein." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Einstein’s definition of insanity</a>. “As a good governance person, I would like them to procedurally blunt this thing, because I don't think that they have the votes to get rid of it,” said Blessing. “It's just, how do you crowbar that into the congressional calendar with everything else that they're handling, I think is the real question.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): New data released by the FBI last week showed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/us/fbi-murders-2020-cities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a spike in homicides in 2020</a>, while major crimes overall in the U.S. fell. This marked one of the biggest one-year increases on record, and in addition to the sheer numbers involved, it was also notable that it wasn’t a regional or big-cities-only story — it was a story that affected nearly every part of the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while it’s very unclear what the spike in murder will mean moving forward — there is some evidence that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/upshot/murder-rise-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 has already been less deadly</a>, for instance — it does raise larger questions around how we think and talk about violent crime in the U.S., especially as it pertains to our politics. For instance, crime and policing were major issues in the 2020 presidential election, with some evidence <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-2020-autopsy-midterms/2021/05/18/6114af82-b80d-11eb-a5fe-bb49dc89a248_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that it may have hurt Democrats</a>. It’s already been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/29/politics/new-york-mayor-primary-eric-adams-rising-crime/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a key issue in the 2021 elections</a>, too; although it isn’t clear whether <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/23/buffalo-mayor-socialist-india-walton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ messaging on policing and crime has hurt them</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s talk about the politics of crime. First of all, what do we even mean when we talk about crime?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/jacob-kaplan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Kaplan</a>, crime researcher at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs): When people talk about crime they’re usually using the FBI’s list of “major crimes” as a guide (whether they realize that or not). The FBI’s <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ucr/ucr-srs-user-manual-v1.pdf/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list stems back to 1929</a> and includes eight crimes that are serious and generally well-reported — murder, robbery, aggravated assault, rape, burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These crimes are then often summed up into a single value of “major crimes,” but the bulk of the crimes in this category is often property crimes, specifically theft.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/latest-crime-data-us-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80334237</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jennifer.doleac </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/jennifer-doleac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Doleac</a>, economics professor at Texas A&amp;M University): And crime means different things to different people. The FBI tracks serious crime, as Jacob said — and that’s the stuff most people worry about. But lower-level crime (trespassing, drug possession, shoplifting) is far more common, yet not consistently tracked.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/lisa-miller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa Miller</a>, political science professor at Rutgers University):<strong> </strong>As Jennifer is getting at, it’s important to distinguish between different types of crime. Violent crime, especially homicide, is particularly worrisome, even if it hasn’t directly affected a given community. People are understandably fearful when they start hearing that murders are increasing. So I think that if it’s violence that is on the rise, that really is troubling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/amelia-thomson-deveaux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</a>, senior writer): Right, the distinction between property crime and violent crime seems really important. Property crime has been on the decline; it’s violent crime that’s spiking. This is not to say that people aren’t concerned about property crime — but I think when we’re talking about crime in a political context, violence is what drives a lot of the fears and knee-jerk reactions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> And it wasn’t just murder that went up in 2020, either. Aggravated assault — an assault that involved a weapon or seriously injured the victim — went up too, with assaults involving a gun driving a lot of the uptick.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/maggie-koerth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie Koerth</a>, senior science writer): Oh, that’s a really interesting question, Sarah, because it’s bigger than crime statistics. I think it’s about whether people feel safe in their communities. And that can be based on a lot of things. Some real risk to life and limb and some perceptions of risk. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I remember being really struck by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-convinced-crime-is-rising-in-the-u-s-theyre-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the work of Wesley Skogan</a>, who worked in Chicago in the 1990s, documenting the things that people who requested police assistance wanted solved. And what he found was that people were often thinking about things like litter and loud music as emblematic of safety problems or their fear for their communities — even when those things aren’t, strictly speaking, crime. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> The terms can get pretty mushy here, too. If we say that violence is rising, are we talking about murders? Aggravated assault? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Jennifer was suggesting, “crime” and “violence” can mean different things to different people that don’t map easily onto the data we have. And of course, politicians don’t make clean distinctions when they’re talking about crime and violence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>I agree with Amelia that violence is what drives fear, though Maggie’s point is really important, too — sometimes a lot of things get conflated. But in <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/crime-and-punishment-in-post-war-britain-mob-rule-as-democratic-corrective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my own research</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/incarceration-nation/9ABCAFF7C3E47BCC7F32D800DF3EDF09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in others’</a>, rising violence is something that really registers for people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> “Crime” is such a vague term and can range from shoplifting to murder that even academics have a hard time agreeing on what offenses should be included.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> That’s completely right, Jacob. And it tends to be defined through policing data, too — which is kind of odd in itself, since arrests are just the beginning of a<em> long</em> criminal justice process that doesn’t necessarily end in a conviction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> Yeah, I think if we had much better court/prosecutor data, we’d have completely different conversations about crime. But there’s almost no good public data on that (though Philadelphia’s district attorney’s office <a href="https://billypenn.com/2019/10/03/philly-da-krasner-criminal-justice-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is one exception</a>), so as Amelia says, we’re reliant on data that is first reported to or observed by the police and then reported by the police to the FBI.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One thing we do see in the data, though, is that<strong> </strong>the 2020 murder spike is also relatively broad — affecting a lot more people than just “gang members,” as <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/retaliatory-gang-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some organizations</a> have claimed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to my analysis of FBI data for agencies that reported detailed murder info in both 2019 and 2020, nearly every single group of murder victims experienced an uptick last year — though it’s important to stress that some of these groups have really low incident rates to begin with, which can result in large swings between years.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> Woah, Jacob. Does that mean that violence against husbands is way up and violence against wives is down?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> Yes, but remember: Few husbands are murdered. For instance, 58 husbands were killed in 2019, compared with 79 in 2020. Whereas, for wives, 330 were murdered in 2019, compared with 294 in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> Gotcha. That makes a lot more sense. So the big takeaway from that chart is less about the different types of victims affected, and more that murder increases in 2020 aren’t something that was happening to a narrow swath of the population?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> Right. Nearly every relationship group had an increased number of murders in 2020, regardless of the relationship type, so one takeaway from the uptick in murders in 2020 is that it’s not isolated to certain types of murders.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Jacob, do we have a sense yet for why the murder spike is so broad?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> I don’t think we’ll be able to answer why it’s so broad for a while — especially not until the other, more detailed FBI data comes out from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/nibrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Incident-Based Reporting System later this year.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there is evidence at this point that it’s not just an increase in gun violence in 2020; other use of deadly weapons also increased.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, however, the quality of the data does seem to have dropped in 2020. There was just a lot more incomplete data. True, the data quality is generally pretty unsatisfactory, given that reporting is voluntary so not all agencies report in the first place, but I’d guess that there was an effect had by the transition to how the FBI is now collecting this data and the resource constraints caused by COVID-19.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Well, that answers one question I had, Jacob. I had seen <a href="https://www.vox.com/22529989/2020-murders-guns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a theory floated</a> that people were simply carrying more guns in 2020, and that this explains some of the increase. But if use of other weapons increased too, that’s plainly not the answer!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> There is good evidence that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-police-increase-gun-seizures-but-shootings-rise-11618494435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people were carrying more guns</a>, and gun murders did go up more than other types of murders. But it’s not the only story.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> That’s interesting. One thought I had prior to you saying that: Research that has suggested <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more guns in a household or a community is correlated with an increased risk of homicide</a> for the people who live there. Like, it wasn’t shocking to me to see a massive increase in gun purchasing and a big increase in gun murders happening in tandem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But clearly that’s not the whole story here.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/policing-happen-77102704</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>Is it possible that the broadness of the spike in murder is a function of decline in trust and legitimacy as a result of the pandemic? Or polarization and general political unrest, more generally? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Lisa, do you mean that people were less likely to call the police or other authorities when they were in situations that could lead to violence, and that perhaps this explains the spike?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>Amelia, I was thinking more about theories of violence self-help — that is, people are less likely to restrain the urge to act out violently when there is less of a sense of shared legitimacy and social trust. Or the idea that <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Losing-Legitimacy-Street-Crime-And-The-Decline-Of-Social-Institutions-In/Lafree/p/book/9780813334516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criminologist Gary LaFree</a> and <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674035201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historian Randolph Roth</a> have put forth that suggests societies with higher levels of social trust and political legitimacy experience lower rates of homicide. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, when those relations break down — or if they are not deeply established in the first place — we see higher levels of homicide. And we certainly seem to be living in such a time period now, where trust and legitimacy were already pretty low even before the pandemic. I wonder if the pandemic may have exacerbated those problems.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> You guys, why can’t crime patterns neatly stick to theories of crime and human behavior? (I kid.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> As you all are getting at, there is no one answer for why there was an increase in violent crime, but what are some of the factors we can point to? We’ve talked about the role guns played in this and how that’s not the whole story. But what role did the pandemic play? Or last summer’s protests for racial justice that followed George Floyd’s murder? Is there a “<a href="https://theconversation.com/more-guns-pandemic-stress-and-a-police-legitimacy-crisis-created-perfect-conditions-for-homicide-spike-in-2020-168823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police legitimacy crisis</a>” as political scientist Justin Nix has argued?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jennifer.doleac: </strong>I’ve had the chance to preview a few as-of-yet unpublished studies with conflicting answers about what happens to the reporting of crime statistics after high-profile police killings. It seems to matter sometimes — perhaps because communities that were most affected didn’t trust the police much in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some evidence</a> of a “Ferguson effect,” where police appear to pull back in the face of criticism/protests. And, of course, it’s hard to isolate the effect of the pandemic as everyone is stressed out and many people lost jobs and income over the past year and a half, so those issues could be contributing to the increase in violence, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are just a bunch of possible explanations and no good way to nail down whether one is better than others. We may never know, given how much was going on during this period.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> And when you consider that we still don’t have a consensus for why violent crime increased in the 1980s and then decreased in the 1990s — and even continued its decrease up until now — it’s going to be really hard to figure out what’s happening now, like Jennifer said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Yeah, the difficulty of untangling different, simultaneous social forces is something that a bunch of experts raised when I was talking to them about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-doesnt-know-why-crime-rises-or-falls-neither-does-biden-or-any-other-politician/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why crime rose and fell</a> a few decades ago. You can’t go back and do a lot of controlled experiments to figure it out, unfortunately!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> And even if you could, what worked in the 1990s may not work now.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> But the political dimensions are really interesting to me. Criminal justice reform takes a loooooong time. So even when politicians do focus on it, the incentive is to do something that has a quick impact they can point to. Which is not always what’s best or most effective.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jennifer.doleac: </strong>It’s a challenging conversation to have now, given some of the politics around police reform, but I think police reform is still very important to improving trust between communities and law enforcement. We have lots of evidence that police are very effective at reducing violent crime, like homicide. <a href="http://morganwilliamsjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chalfin_et_al_2021_WP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One paper</a> from a group of economists and public policy scholars finds that hiring more police officers reduces homicide rates and disproportionately benefits Black communities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the nonprofit Criminal Justice Expert Panel (which I co-direct) recently <a href="https://cjexpertpanel.org/surveys/reducing-gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveyed leading crime researchers about popular options</a> for reducing gun violence, such as gang-takedowns/hot-spot policing, community-led violence interrupters and focused deterrence on community members known to be at-risk. We found that researchers were most bullish on the first option (gang-takedowns/hot-spot policing) and somewhat optimistic about the third (focused deterrence), though with lots of caveats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The evidence on focused deterrence (which involves police) and community-led violence interrupters (which do not), however, is pretty weak and mixed. That means, despite both being popular among advocates of police reform, we’re not actually sure those policies are proven. It doesn’t mean they’re not promising, but it’s complicated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>What I find interesting here is that many of the policies and programs — which are evidence-based — are the types of programs that have historically come under fire from <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/defunding-the-police-will-actually-make-us-safer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groups critical of the police</a>. “Gang takedowns,” hot-spot policing and focused deterrence sound a lot like the kind of aggressive policing — including stop and frisk — that is likely to run into resistance from groups that are seeking to minimize, not expand, the role of policing in confronting crime. While the public would like to see the police involved <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/6/16/voters-support-the-use-of-nonpolice-first-responders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in fewer social problems</a>, there is <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/usa-today-crime-and-safety-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread support</a> for the police dealing with serious crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> One of the things I thought was interesting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-police-reform-a-fundamentally-flawed-idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when Amelia and I were reporting on police reforms</a> is that all those things COULD represent aggressive policing — or they might not. It depends on how they’re implemented, and they’re implemented in such different ways that it’s often hard to compare data. And it ends up making these conversations harder, too. Because some people might imagine “hot-spot policing” and think of stop and frisk. And some people might imagine something more like a beat cop with a presence in the community. And it could mean either or both.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> And one of the challenges for me in thinking about what’s “evidence-based” is that the experiences of the people who are living in high-crime communities <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/17/we-listened-people-highly-policed-us-communities/?utm_campaign=wp_monkeycage&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be hard to incorporate</a> in that kind of research. Maybe a particular reform or approach does reduce crime in the short term — but does it make people living in those places feel safer in the long run? That’s obviously harder to measure, but it’s important to explore.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> We’ve talked about some of the reasons why violent crime might have spiked in 2020, as well as possible ways to curb it going forward, but what are some of the risks if elected officials ignore the problem? Is this <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an issue that is particularly challenging for Democrats</a> because of where some on the political left stand on police reform?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Well, to state the obvious, it’s bad if politicians are ignoring a trend that is making people’s lives worse or more dangerous. So if people are truly feeling less safe, that’s important for politicians to address. The problem is that it’s hard to figure out how much of people’s feelings <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/16/voters-perceptions-of-crime-continue-to-conflict-with-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are being driven</a> by what politicians are saying about crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>I think of this in two ways — the short-term and the long-term. In the long-term, if this is a temporary rise in violence, it’s possible it won’t have a big electoral impact. In the short term, I do think it carries risks for some Democrats if they are primarily responsive to the groups demanding that cities <a href="https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/6-reasons-why-its-time-to-defund-police" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divest from policing or shrink police forces</a>. People want <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195331684.001.0001/acprof-9780195331684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more police when violence is rising</a>. That doesn’t mean they want police to be abusive or violent. But reducing police services during such a time has some political peril.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jennifer.doleac: </strong>Another possible risk here is that the momentum behind criminal justice reform is lost. There has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-prison-reform-has-bipartisan-support-but-its-moving-slowly/2020/01/08/81edfbd6-3268-11ea-898f-eb846b7e9feb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad support for meaningful reforms</a> across the criminal justice system, for many years now. That’s likely in part because people have felt safe enough to be open to scaling back things like policing and incarceration. But if violent crime starts rising, that support might vanish, even if those reforms were moving us in the right direction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> It’s not a good thing that murders are up! But it’s hard to have these discussions in a nuanced way. Nor is it often in politicians’ best interest to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Electorally, though, is it worse for Democrats? I’m not sure. I think the bigger risk is that, as Jennifer and others are saying, reform policies that were getting floated on the left get scaled back because of fears about the electoral consequences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> And whether it’s electorally bad or not, it’s bad for the reforms — because the perception of electoral challenges is there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Do you all see politics forcing a choice between reform and safety? Or rather, safety from police and safety from criminals? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>I think some politicians will present the choice that way, but I don’t think that is inevitable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What I can say — from 25 years of researching the politics of violent crime in local, state, national and cross-national contexts — is that a serious crime wave is likely to result in more policing and more imprisonment. That has <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190228705.001.0001/acprof-9780190228705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happened in every context I’ve examined</a>. But policing and prisons don’t have to be the only responses, and the responses don’t have to be on a mass scale. There are many ways to increase policing, and even confinement, that are not as brutal as the system we have in the U.S.</p>

			<category>Presidential Approval</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">President Joe Biden spent the beginning of his term comfortably above water in the polls. On July 20, the six-month anniversary of his inauguration, his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average job approval rating</a> stood at 52.3 percent, and his average disapproval rating stood at 42.5 percent — numbers that were fairly representative of his first semester. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-approval-rating-has-barely-budged-in-his-first-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeymoon period</a> came to a halt in late summer. The delta variant of the coronavirus led to a surge in cases and deaths starting in late July, accompanied by renewed fears about the economy and inflation; by Aug. 15, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval rating had dropped</a> 2.3 percentage points (to 50.0 percent), and his disapproval rating had risen 1.3 points (to 43.8 percent). That same day, the Taliban <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/taliban-seize-jalalabad-cut-off-afghan-capital-east-79462637" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seized control of Kabul</a>, the capital of Afghanistan, completing a stunningly fast collapse of the country’s government following the withdrawal of American troops. The Taliban takeover, and the ensuing <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/afghanistan-faces-humanitarian-crisis-taliban-takes-control-79521011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humanitarian crisis</a>, appeared to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-declining-approval-rating-is-not-just-about-afghanistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accelerate the decrease in Biden’s popularity</a>. By Aug. 30, more Americans disapproved of Biden’s job performance than approved of it, and on Sept. 8, his approval/disapproval spread was 45.0 percent to 49.1 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the time, we theorized that Biden’s approval rating might recover before too long, especially once the news cycle moved on from the crisis in Afghanistan. After all, presidents’ approval ratings <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to revert to the mean</a>, and fluctuations in former President Donald Trump’s approval rating were especially short-lived. But we’re now more than a month removed from Biden’s difficult August, and there have been no signs of a rebound in his approval rating. At the end of the day on Oct. 5, Biden’s approval/disapproval spread was 44.8 percent to 47.9 percent. That approval rating, in fact, is so far the lowest of his presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s approval rating has failed to improve even as Afghanistan has faded from the headlines. According to <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=Afghanistan&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20210801000000&amp;edt=20210930235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fcs=comb&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;fdt=-05%3A00&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed-captioning data</a> from the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Television News Archive</a>, from Aug. 12 through Sept. 1, the three major cable-news networks (CNN, Fox News and MSNBC) mentioned Afghanistan in an average of 1,320 15-second clips per day. From Sept. 2 through Sept. 30, however, they mentioned the country in an average of only 403 clips per day. (This is, however, still more often than Afghanistan was in the news before the Taliban’s takeover. From Aug. 1 through Aug. 11, the three networks mentioned Afghanistan in an average of just 56 clips per day.)</p>

The timing of it suggested it was also driven by the resurgent pandemic, dissatisfaction with the economy, or even natural post-honeymoon reversion to a mean that is more realistic in these polarized times. In other words, a myriad of factors.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Accordingly, there may be no easy fix for Biden. Even an improvement in the COVID-19 situation may not improve his political fortunes: According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data compiled by The New York Times</a>, the rolling average of newly detected COVID-19 cases nationally has decreased since mid-September, but <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s average approval rating on the issue of the coronavirus</a> has remained steady. (As of Oct. 5,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> 50.5 percent of Americans approved of his handling of the pandemic, and 40.7 percent disapproved.) </p>

It doesn’t mean, however, that Biden won’t receive a political boost if and when the pandemic truly ends. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other news developments could help or hurt Biden politically as well, such as whether Democrats in Congress pass their infrastructure and budget reconciliation bills or if the government defaults on its debt. So we’ll have to wait and see what happens to Biden’s approval rating going forward — which will be important for, among other reasons, assessing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how big of a shellacking Democrats will receive in the 2022 midterm elections</a> (or if they will receive one at all). But for now at least, Biden has a lower approval rating at this point in his term than all but two presidents<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerald Ford and Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> since 1945, so if he’s going to regain his popularity, he’s got an unusually big hole to dig himself out of.</p>

In the past few weeks, congressional Democrats have been involved in a number of talks among party factions and with the Biden administration over the fate of two major bills: their <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-11-trillion-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-big/story?id=79378221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan infrastructure bill</a> and their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/us/politics/government-shutdown-congress-infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion spending plan</a>. At this point, too, both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/us/politics/pelosi-infrastructure-house-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive</a> and more <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/politics/house-moderate-democrats-infrastructure-strategy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate Democrats</a> have threatened to walk away from the deals — one reason why so <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/25/biden-agenda-democrats-congress-514263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many headlines are declaring</a> that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/01/30/people-used-to-joke-about-democrats-in-disarray-theyre-not-joking-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are in disarray</a>. Moreover, regardless of the outcome of these specific bills, it is likely that struggles between moderate and progressive members of the party will continue to be an issue going forward.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But does this mean that the internal fault lines in the Democratic Party are likely to be detrimental to its functioning? Or are we just seeing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-23/are-democrats-in-disarray-or-just-negotiating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy negotiating</a> in a party that represents a diverse array of constituencies and interests?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On one hand, the resonance of the “Democrats in disarray” trope is due to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-too-much-media-attention-could-hurt-the-democrats-new-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the media’s interest in covering conflict</a>, and as was true historically, the Democratic Party remains a patchwork party. Coalitions have certainly changed — gone are the days of the <a href="https://millercenter.org/president/fdroosevelt/the-american-franchise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uneasy “New Deal Coalition”</a> between civil rights supporters and the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Dixiecrat_Revolt_and_the_End_of_the/EWu2AX7Gx4YC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=the+dixiecrat+revolt&amp;pg=PP5&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movement’s opponents</a> — but Democrats must now balance<strong> </strong>a multiracial coalition that is multifaceted in what it wants politically. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, the past several election cycles have featured debates between progressive and moderate Democrats over how far to the left the party should go in its stance on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/09/2020-election-news-democrats-embrace-15-minimum-wage-against-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising the minimum wage</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21005124/2020-presidential-candidates-health-care-democratic-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a universal health care system</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/14/20880659/2020-democratic-debates-climate-change-six-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressing climate change</a>.<strong> </strong>Splits in the Democratic Party are further complicated by the fact that support from voters without a college degree, who tend to be less likely to <a href="https://www.marottaonmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Understanding-Shifts-in-Democratic-Party-Ideology-Article.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identify as liberal</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is declining</a>, while college-educated voters, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who tend to be more liberal</a>, are growing in influence. These ideological divides are also evident by age: Younger voters, who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/election-young-voters-biden-democratic-party.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are generally more progressive</a> — especially on issues like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/10/30/young-voters-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> — are another important constituency shaping disagreements on economic and cultural issues in the party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, no matter how uneasy the coalition of progressives and moderates might be at times, Democrats are overall much closer ideologically than they were previously.<strong> </strong>Additionally, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative partisanship</a> means that no faction in the Democratic Party is likely to defect to the Republican Party or do anything that would help Republicans electorally (like splinter off and form a new political group). Finally, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationalized nature</a> of our party politics means that all members’ fortunes are increasingly tied to the party brand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, even though there is less ideological diversity in the Democratic Party today — <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/328367/americans-political-ideology-held-steady-2020.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very few Democrats identify as conservative</a>, for instance — the question of just how liberal Democrats are willing to go is still a big one that can cause a lot of problems for the party. As underscored by the recent negotiations over infrastructure and the budget, it’s possible, too, that some of these ideological fights are pretty muddy. In the House, there’s the progressive faction, represented by <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJayapal/status/1445025926627004416?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Pramila Jayapal</a>; the moderate faction, represented by <a href="https://www.insidernj.com/the-gottheimer-ascendancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Josh Gottheimer</a> and the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight other House moderates</a> who have worked to limit the spending in the bills; and the faction of “mainstream” liberals, who are ready and willing to cut deals, represented by leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three ideological factions is certainly challenging to manage, but it also makes sense for a party that represents such a wide range of constituencies. Often, compromises can be found to honor different preferences and priorities. On Friday, for instance, President Biden and Pelosi said that <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-floats-roughly-2-trillion-price-tag-for-reconciliation-08740ed0-2db3-4ce7-8088-2a1d36644e38.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting on the bipartisan infrastructure bill must again be delayed</a> until Democrats are able to make progress on their party’s spending plan. This move was a victory for progressives in that they had threatened to tank the bipartisan bill without being able to also vote on the Democrats’ ambitious budget. Cutting the spending plan’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/politics/progressives-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-democrats/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion price tag</a> — something moderates in the party have long pushed for — also points to the limits of what progressives will be able to demand in future negotiations. Remember, though, this big-tent party approach to politics isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it’s part of governing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is a more concerning possibility that Democrats are divided not only on questions of policy but also on an establishment versus anti-establishment dimension. Hints of this appear in the efforts of Democratic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/03/joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema-democrats-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin</a> to cultivate political reputations independent from — even in defiance of — their party. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/22/bernie-sanders-just-declared-war-on-the-democratic-establishment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anti-establishment</a> rhetoric has sometimes been a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-pelosi-versus-squad-paradigm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staple of the left</a>, too. Sen. Bernie Sanders liked to use these appeals during his two presidential bids, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/18/progressives-democratic-party-despair-255675" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presenting himself to supporters</a> as a rebuke to the party establishment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former FiveThirtyEighter <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-two-cracks-in-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry Enten and I wrote</a> about this phenomenon in the Republican Party in 2017, and four years later, it doesn’t seem like it was a positive development for the GOP. That’s because unlike policy, “outsider status” isn’t something that can be easily solved by compromise. As a result, the Republican Party has become less open to <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/for-2020-2003/html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissenting views</a> and a big-tent approach to policy and instead more dominated by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-might-still-be-trumps-party-but-that-doesnt-mean-theres-room-for-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a loyalty to former President Donald Trump</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible a similar fate <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/virginia-democrats-challengers-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could befall Democrats</a>. After all, Democrats’ two major bills could still fall apart, suggesting that the party’s differences are a serious hindrance to accomplishing Biden’s agenda. It’s also possible that some Democratic factions <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/primary-distrust-political-distrust-and-support-for-the-insurgent-candidacies-of-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-in-the-2016-primary/578E3061392DDE1BF3BE3F615054F97A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distrust the party’s leadership</a> enough to create a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/democrats-divided-progressives-centrists-say-trust-gone-a3d66f83ddac9b18e607f46429dbc408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent fault line</a> around “outsider” status, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/us/politics/tea-party-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Tea Party movement did for the Republicans</a>. However, the lack of a polarizing internal figure like Trump works in Democrats’ favor, and most congressional Democrats seem to at least want <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1041793588/a-looming-partial-government-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislative victories</a>, not just take public stances. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what will determine whether intra-party disagreement proves to be a healthy back-and-forth among Democrats or a dysfunctional rivalry? There are a few things to look for. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, the depth of the policy disagreements. So far, it hasn’t seemed like there was much disagreement over the Democrats’ need to pursue both bills — just over the strategy and dollar amount. That said, within the party, you can still see the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/31/are-we-entering-a-new-political-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stirrings of disagreement</a> around whether the country needs some of its basic structures overhauled — including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/12/18/democrats-campaign-is-fight-over-future-american-capitalism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy and income inequality</a>, voting rights protections, and questions like <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/statehood-for-washington-d-c-and-puerto-rico-background-and-political-implications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitting new states</a> or <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/15/democrats-introduce-legislation-expand-supreme-court/7233345002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restructuring the courts</a>. These issues could become widely held Democratic priorities, or they could expose serious variation in the way different legislators and their voters view American politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other danger is that the divisions among Democrats start to look like those in the party system at large — that is, more splits rooted in <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo27527354.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social identities</a> that are increasingly focused on winning rather than on identifying common goals. Put another way, if any faction of the Democratic party becomes more interested in <a href="https://www.legbranch.org/honest-messengers-how-symbolic-messaging-votes-in-congress-match-vote-choices-on-real-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messaging than legislating</a>, it’ll lose incentives to compromise. In fact, the incentives will ultimately go the other way, making it more attractive to take a stand than to pass a bill. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the Democratic Party doesn’t seem close to this situation right now. While it may not always seem like it, the different factions in the Democratic Party still represent policy differences — not fault lines. That’s namely because ideological differences still don’t map perfectly onto the party’s different constituencies. Yes, some of the party’s moderates, like Manchin, represent constituencies further from the mainstream of the Democratic Party — <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/which-us-states-are-the-oldest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">places with</a> more <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/WV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white, older voters</a>. But this isn’t true of all moderate Democrats. Rep. Carolyn Bordeaux of Georgia, for instance, represents a majority-minority district that has <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US1307-congressional-district-7-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantial populations</a> of Black, Latino and Asian residents. And while someone like Jayapal, who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, represents a far more diverse district with a lot of <a href="https://www.census.gov/mycd/?st=53&amp;cd=07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college-educated voters</a>, Rep. Ilhan Omar, who isn’t that different from Jayapal politically, hails from a district with a <a href="https://www.census.gov/mycd/?st=27&amp;cd=05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much lower share</a> of college-educated voters. As a result, ideological differences are not likely to create permanently warring factions in the Democratic Party — at least at this point. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Party divisions are inevitable in big-tent coalitions. Policy disagreements across the ideological spectrum are healthy: It’s arguably the efforts to flatten out these divisions among Republicans that have made the past few years so troubling for the Republican Party and its role in American democracy. The nature of partisan politics has also made it harder for internal factions to splinter from the Democratic Party. Trying to form a third party would tank electoral prospects and all but ensure Republican victories at the federal level. And Republicans are unlikely to go after progressives, regardless of how disgruntled that group might become with the Democratic leadership. This should allow progressives and moderates to form flexible coalitions in the long term, and hold off the biggest threat to party stability — one faction getting angry enough to leave altogether. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The government avoided a shutdown last week, but questions remain over how much of President Biden’s agenda Congress will pass. Democrats delayed a vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill after progressives said they would not vote for it without an agreement on a separate social programs bill. That latter bill is still in flux, though: West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin suggested a price tag <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/30/manchin-proposed-15t-topline-number-to-schumer-this-summer-514803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 trillion less</a> than what other Democrats originally proposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew tries to unpack what’s driving Democrats’ decisions and who will have to compromise to get both bills passed. They also address a listener question that suggests Republicans achieve their policy goals more often than Democrats. They discuss whether that assumption is really true, why partisans often <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/25/winners-and-losers-in-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feel the opposing party wins more</a> and how to measure victory in politics. Finally, they preview next month’s gubernatorial election in Virginia and what it can tell us about the 2022 midterms.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court is more conservative than it’s been in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/politics/supreme-court-conservative/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost a century</a>. ​​Its new term begins today, and by next June, when the term ends, Americans might finally understand what that means. Public opinion of the court is already <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354908/approval-supreme-court-down-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a record low</a> after the court allowed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a strict abortion law to go into effect in Texas</a> in early September. Now, the justices are preparing to hear the court’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/26/990846329/supreme-court-to-take-up-first-major-gun-rights-case-in-more-than-a-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first major gun rights case since 2010</a> as well as a case on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the future of abortion in the U.S.</a> Both cases could result in decisions that are far more extreme than most Americans want. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the past, a desire to preserve the court’s apolitical reputation <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-can-stop-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the justices</a> from straying too far from public opinion. That could happen again — in fact, Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-big-rulings-were-surprisingly-mainstream-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has so far proven remarkably adept</a> at producing decisions that protect the court’s reputation and that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ab215fc5f71b8d24e0360f69f011cf67" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are often portrayed</a> as more moderate and mainstream than they really are. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This term, though, the other conservative justices might be fine with taking a very public right turn. Neither <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-views-on-gun-control-have-changed-in-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding gun rights</a> nor <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-dont-want-roe-v-wade-repealed-but-many-also-support-restrictions-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturning Roe v. Wade</a> would be popular, yet the court is considering both — a sign of how conservative it has already become. The question now is whether the risk of a backlash is enough to keep the conservative majority from, say, overturning Roe in an election year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The justices are plainly conscious of public attitudes toward the court,” said <a href="https://polisci.osu.edu/people/baum.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawrence Baum</a>, a political science professor at Ohio State University. “But that’s only one consideration for the justices and not necessarily the most important one — particularly on issues like abortion or gun rights where they may have intense personal preferences about the right outcome.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/texas-abortion-ban-rest-country-fivethirtyeight-79824406</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The justices are already entering the term with mixed reviews from the general public. <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/22/poll-support-u-s-supreme-court-drops/5804331001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Marquette University Law School poll conducted in September</a> found that only 49 percent of Americans approved of the court, down from 60 percent just a year earlier. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354908/approval-supreme-court-down-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll conducted in September</a> found a similar drop: Only 40 percent of U.S. adults approved of the court, down from 53 percent a year earlier. According to Gallup, a majority (53 percent) of U.S. adults now disapprove of the way the court is handling its job.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Approval of the Supreme Court is at a record low" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Erg3e/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In theory, the justices should have no reason to watch their polling numbers. Our system is actually designed that way: Federal judges have life tenure in part <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed78.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to insulate them from the vagaries of politics</a>. But research suggests that the justices are influenced by what Americans think, at least to a certain extent. For example, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2087255" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several studies</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00485.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have found</a> that the Supreme Court’s ideological tilt tracks with public opinion over time, which is unlikely to be coincidental. And <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/clark-tom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Clark</a>, a political scientist at Emory University, found in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00411.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate review</a> of congressional bills that when Congress introduced more bills designed to curb the court, the justices struck down fewer laws. According to Clark, that suggests that the court saw the bills as a signal from Congress that they were going too far, even though the bills were unlikely to pass.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this year, President Biden arguably introduced his own version of a court-curbing bill, in the form of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/us/politics/biden-supreme-court-packing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a commission to study</a> expanding the Supreme Court. But the conservatives don’t have a lot to fear there, at least for now, because the commission seems <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/10/22375792/supreme-court-biden-commission-reform-court-packing-federalist-society" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely to recommend</a> big changes. And even if it did, GOP senators won’t support court reform, which means Democrats <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56893296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would have to abolish the filibuster</a> to make that happen — currently <a href="https://www.vox.com/22319564/filibuster-reform-manchin-democrats-nuclear-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a no-go in the Senate</a>. All in all, the conservative justices don't have a lot of reason to see Biden's move as a threat.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It's also possible that Supreme Court justices mostly care about their reputation among a select group of Americans. Baum and <a href="https://law2.wm.edu/faculty/bios/fulltime/nedevi.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neal Devins</a>, a professor of law and government at the College of William &amp; Mary, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-company-they-keep-9780190278052?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have argued</a> that Supreme Court justices are more interested in how they’re regarded by elites. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is significant for understanding why the conservative justices’ behavior has become more predictably right-wing. Baum and Devins argue that as elites have grown more politically polarized, the justices’ partisan tendencies have hardened as well. In other words, the people influencing the conservative justices' thoughts are probably much more right-wing than the public at large. On top of that, some of the justices may be willing to risk backlash for the outcome they believe is correct. “Is legitimacy something that’s enough to get a justice to move away from something [he or she] strongly feels?” Baum told me. With the possible exception of Roberts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/john-roberts-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is particularly focused on the court’s image</a>, Baum doesn’t think the public’s views will be enough to sway a justice who cares deeply about the issue they’re deciding.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this might be right. On one hand, it’s not obvious that a single unpopular ruling -- even if it’s high-profile -- would be enough to sow widespread doubt in the Supreme Court’s legitimacy. Take the outcome in Bush v. Gore, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/13/us/bush-prevails-single-vote-justices-end-recount-blocking-gore-after-5-week.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where a divided Supreme Court</a>, split along partisan lines, effectively handed the presidency to George W. Bush. The ruling was intensely controversial at the time, but it <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4092195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to have had</a> little lasting impact on the court’s image. And although it might be hard to imagine, the same could be true of a decision that overturns or reshapes Roe — particularly if the justices  merely limit the constitutional right to abortion, rather than eliminate it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the question of how a highly conservative Supreme Court majority will navigate public opinion isn’t going away. And it becomes even more relevant if the conservatives maintain control of the court for years or even decades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In the past, even if the court was trending conservative overall, it wasn’t like the conservatives always won and the liberals always lost,” said <a href="https://pppa.wsu.edu/michael-salamone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Salamone</a>, a political science professor at Washington State University who studies the Supreme Court and public opinion. “Now it’s looking like conservative victories are going to be a lot more consistent and a lot more far-reaching.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In that sense, this new term might be a turning point — and not just because of the importance of the cases or the risk of a backlash to an individual decision. The next few months might be the beginning of a new era in which the conservative justices move sharply away from where most Americans stand on major issues, and dare politicians to do something about it.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This is the latest edition of our column that excavates the origins of public figures’ factually dubious comments. We explain what their claims are referring to, the evidence (or lack thereof) behind them and where they sprang from in the first place.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Who said what …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few weeks ago, Breitbart News — the right-wing, hyperpartisan news site <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/steve-bannon-breitbart-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formerly run by Steve Bannon</a> — published a truly <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galaxy brain</a> column. Editor-at-large <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2021/09/10/nolte-howard-stern-proves-democrats-want-unvaccinated-trump-voters-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Nolte argued</a> that Democrats have been promoting the COVID-19 vaccine not to save lives but instead to trick Republican voters into <em>not</em> getting the jab. Nolte’s theory concluded that this, in turn, would lead to unvaccinated Republicans getting sick and dying from COVID-19, ultimately helping Democrats electorally. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nolte claimed that liberals, in a sinister application of reverse psychology, knew that aggressively pushing the vaccine would lead those on the right to <em>resist</em>, putting them at greater risk for severe infection or death. “In a country where elections are decided on razor-thin margins, does it not benefit one side if their opponents simply drop dead?” Nolte wrote. He then said that the real way to stick it to liberals would be to embrace the “Trump Vaccine” for the life-saving modern miracle that it is.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sometimes flawed logic can still lead you to the correct conclusion.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/white-evangelicals-rethinking-politics-fivethirtyeight-80316696</p>


<h2><strong>Some background …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nolte’s take has emerged from the toxic politicization of the pandemic in the U.S. Since the COVID-19 vaccine rollout began in the U.S, there has been a partisan gap in vaccination rates. When comparing the rate of fully vaccinated people living in counties that voted for Trump in 2020 with those in counties that voted for Biden, blue counties had a higher vaccination rate by 12.9 percentage points, according <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>. Similarly, a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/covid19-vaccine-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> has shown that Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say they are unsure of whether they will get the vaccine. Republicans are also more likely to say they do not plan on getting vaccinated, according to that same poll. And it’s true that more right-leaning areas of the country are seeing more deaths from COVID-19, too: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent New York Times analysis</a> showed states with some of the highest 2020 vote share for Trump also have the highest death rates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These differences in vaccination rates and COVID-19 death rates can be attributed to a few factors, including misinformation online and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the erosion of trust</a> in institutions such as the medical system and the media over the past few years. It can also be partly attributed to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-0433cfa3b684b50d0c67ed254f8d8c39" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rhetoric from Republican leaders</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/conservative-talk-radio-covid-deaths/2021/08/31/a912a89c-0a66-11ec-aea1-42a8138f132a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figures on the right</a>, especially when you consider that similar partisan gaps <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/7/6/22554198/political-polarization-vaccine-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have not been seen in other countries</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is no evidence that those who have encouraged Americans to get vaccinated secretly hoped they would do the opposite. </p>

<h2><strong>Where the comment came from …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Brietbart column’s argument may seem unhinged, Nolte is in fact tapping into a number of right-wing tropes. Conspiratorial thinking has become a habit on the right — think the Big Lie or QAnon — so proposing a conspiracy to explain Republicans’ low vaccination rates may not be anathema for many of Nolte’s readers. Similarly, allegations of Democrats or leftists running false flag operations — where the responsible party for an event makes it look like another party is in fact behind the act — are common among the far-right. Many have claimed, for example, that the rioters who broke into the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 were actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/us/politics/antifa-conspiracy-capitol-riot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members of antifa disguised</a> to look like Trump supporters in order to make the right look bad. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The notion that politicians may be using reverse psychology when referencing the vaccine is also familiar to many on the right, albeit inverted from Nolte’s presentation of it. Those who oppose the vaccine — particularly those who incorrectly believe it to be harmful — have been surprised to hear former President Donald Trump promote it, and reverse psychology has been a useful explanation for his seeming deviation from their worldview. These theories claim that Trump’s encouragement of vaccinations would make the vaccine <em>less</em> appealing to anti-Trump voters, while arguing that those who support Trump are wise enough to “do their own research” and avoid it despite his recommendation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As far as him promoting it, my thought is [he is using] reverse psychology for the sheep with [<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/politics/trump-derangement-syndrome/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump Derangement Syndrome</a>] [who] will automatically just do the opposite of what he says,” one Telegram user wrote in a QAnon chat group. “What if Trump is promoting the vaccine to get the ‘Never’ Trumpers to rethink their decision,” wrote another in the same chat. “Anything he promotes they will do the reverse. He must know that those of us that are aware of the real and apparent dangers will NOT get it, even with his endorsement.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nolte also specifically tapped into another American tension: As the partisan gap persists, some on the left have shifted from encouraging those on the right to get vaccinated, to getting frustrated and angry that they still haven’t. This has manifested in sometimes flippant, sometimes cruel reactions to the high rates of infection and death among unvaccinated Americans. Nolte highlighted Howard Stern, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/09/09/howard-stern-unvaccinated-freedom-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who recently suggested</a> on his radio show that unvaccinated individuals who become sick should be denied medical care. Stern also said it was “funny” that some conservative radio hosts who spoke out against the vaccine <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/conservative-talk-radio-covid-deaths/2021/08/31/a912a89c-0a66-11ec-aea1-42a8138f132a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later died of COVID-19</a>. There’s also <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/09/hermancainaward-subreddit-antivaxxer-deaths-cataloged.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the r/HermanCainAward subreddit</a>, named after the Republican politician who died of COVID-19 in 2020, a group with 343,000 members that exists exclusively to mock people who expressed anti-vaccine views and later died of COVID-19.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, if Nolte’s column convinces some vaccine-resisters to get the shot, one <em>might</em> argue that the end justifies the means. But so far the response to the column on the right hasn’t been positive. On Breitbart’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/95475020353/posts/10168131523170354" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook post</a> sharing the column, many commenters rejected the argument, noting that their personal motivations for not getting vaccinated had nothing to do with what Democrats said, and pointing out that some unvaccinated Americans are on the left. “This is a stupid take. You have clearly bought into the democrat talking point that it’s only republicans not getting vaccinated when the reality is that people across the board are not getting vaccinated,” one Facebook user commented. Similar sentiments were shared on Telegram and the pro-Trump message board patriots.win. “Me not getting the Vax has absolutely nothing to do with what the left is saying!” one user wrote in a QAnon Telegram group. Another user in the same group noted: “But didn’t Trump get his vax? It isn’t about Trump, it’s about our personal health.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using conspiratorial thinking to bring conspiracy theorists back to reality may not be the most effective tactic after all. As one Telegram user put it: “Sounds like they’re trying to use reverse psychology by saying they are already using reverse psychology.” </p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats in Congress have their work cut out for them this fall. They were able to cut a deal with Republican lawmakers to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/politics/government-funding-shutdown-vote/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avert a government shutdown</a>, but when it comes to passing the rest of President Biden’s agenda, including both an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/us/politics/government-shutdown-congress-infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious $3.5 trillion spending plan</a> and a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-11-trillion-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-big/story?id=79378221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan infrastructure deal</a>, Democrats have much to sort out. It’s still too early to say how much jeopardy either bill is in — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-house-democrats-may-be-more-united-than-they-seem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assessing Democratic intraparty divisions is difficult</a> — but the fact that Senate Republicans have said <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/46-republican-senators-vow-not-233657646.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ll refuse</a> to help <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-mcconnell-stops-schumers-latest-attempt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise the debt ceiling</a> creates a real legislative challenge for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/treasury-secretary-warns-calamity-congress-raise-debt-limit/story?id=80283655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said the U.S. could run out of money as early as Oct. 18</a>, making it impossible for the U.S. to pay its current financial obligations and creating a risk of debt default that she said would be a “calamity” for the economy. And because almost all Senate Republicans have indicated they won’t vote to raise the debt ceiling, they’ve now created a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/28/politics/debt-limit-house-vote/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game of chicken</a> in which they are arguing that Democrats alone must pass an increase <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2021-05-25_IN11681_619c43d079c47dc0723890acd6318b5b1cd01e60.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through budget reconciliation,</a> while Democrats counter that the GOP should join them in a bipartisan vote to raise it, which is generally how it <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used to work in the Senate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, at this point, a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/27/debt-ceiling-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new poll from Politico/Morning Consult</a> suggests public opinion may not push either party to change course, especially Republicans. Overall, 31 percent of registered voters said they would mostly blame Democrats if the country defaults on its debt, while 20 percent said they would primarily blame the GOP. However, the plurality (39 percent) said they would blame both parties equally, while 11 percent said they didn’t know or had no opinion.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are also torn on whether to raise the debt ceiling, even though there could be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/09/28/how-worried-should-we-be-if-the-debt-ceiling-isnt-lifted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severely damaging ramifications</a> for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-default-6-million-jobs-15-trillion-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failing to raise it</a>. A survey conducted earlier this week by <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/574495-what-americas-thinking-september-29-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill/HarrisX</a> found that 54 percent of registered voters opposed raising the cap, while 46 percent supported the raise. (The poll didn’t include some kind of “don’t know” option, which, as we’ll see, may be important.) Meanwhile, a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/ab8vvo6g3z/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly poll from The Economist/YouGov</a> found that 34 percent of adults favored raising it and 32 percent opposed, with the remaining 34 percent undecided. In both surveys, Republicans were strongly opposed to raising the debt ceiling, while Democrats were about as strongly inclined to support an increase. Independents’ stance on the issue was murkier, but the polls suggested that these voters were slightly more opposed to raising the debt ceiling than they were supportive of it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s likely that many Americans don’t understand what the debt ceiling is or what raising it entails. Consider the high share of respondents who said they were unsure in The Economist/YouGov’s survey. Part of what’s tricky here is the debt ceiling refers to <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/debt-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debt and financial obligations the U.S. has already accrued</a> — such as interest on the country’s debt or previously authorized spending, like Social Security benefits. That is, the debt limit is not a tool that authorizes <em>new</em> spending, as such expenditures are decided in completely separate legislation, like a bill for the next federal budget.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Unfortunately, we don’t have recent polling that examines Americans’ understanding of the debt limit, but past polls back up the idea that many people don’t grasp what it is or what the risks are if it’s not increased. In a 2013 <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/4rsof3kpkv/tabs_HP_debt_limit_20131016%20TABS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HuffPost/YouGov</a> poll, for instance, 42 percent of Americans correctly responded that a higher debt ceiling allowed the country to pay interest on its debt and spending that’s already been authorized, but 39 percent mistakenly said that the debt ceiling directly increased government spending and the amount of debt the U.S. holds. This survey also found plenty of uncertainty, as 20 percent said they weren’t sure what raising the debt ceiling meant. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2011/05/24/more-concern-about-raising-debt-limit-than-government-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll by the Washington Post/Pew Research Center</a> from 2011 — when the debt-ceiling debate <a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/a-familiar-landmine-the-looming-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was particularly fraught</a> — also reflected a misunderstanding of the consequences of raising or not raising the debt limit. In the poll, more Americans were worried about what would happen if the debt ceiling was raised than if it wasn’t: 48 percent were more concerned that raising the debt ceiling would lead to more spending and debt, while 35 percent were more worried that not raising the cap would force a debt default and cause economic harm. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The political consequences of the public’s general lack of understanding are important, though, because it may guide the parties’ position on the debt ceiling. And Republicans may benefit the most, as their current opposition to raising the debt ceiling might be viewed by voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/us/politics/republicans-block-government-funding-bill-debt-limit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as part of their rejection of Democrats’ spending plans</a>. This comes despite the fact that the debt-limit debate is about paying off existing financial obligations — like previously authorized spending and interest on debt accrued <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by past administrations from both parties</a> — rather than any future obligations that the Democrats’ budget proposal might generate. Just how the debt-limit fight will sort itself out in the coming weeks is unclear, but should neither party blink or come to a bipartisan resolution, the country would enter uncharted territory, facing potentially disastrous financial fallout. And in that case, the question of which party is to blame might be a lot more complicated for voters.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1">Over 650 people</a> who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 seeking to overturn the 2020 election have been arrested and charged. But as the FBI tries to identify more rioters, 48 percent of U.S. adults thought the penalties were not severe enough, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/28/declining-share-of-republicans-say-it-is-important-to-prosecute-jan-6-rioters/?utm_content=buffer5d7b4&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Pew Research Center poll</a> that asked about the storming of the Capitol and the related House investigation. Yet, 57 percent of Republicans said there was already too much attention on Jan. 6, and Americans overall are unconfident in the investigation’s fairness, with a majority of Americans (54 percent) not too confident or not at all confident.</li><li>The Hispanic population represents 51 percent of the U.S. population growth between 2010 and 2020, with 19 percent of the country now identifying as either Hispanic or Latino, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html">data from the 2020 census</a>. The majority of Hispanic Americans (54 percent) don’t have a preference on whether they describe themselves as Hispanic or Latino, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/23/who-is-hispanic/?utm_content=bufferb2d71&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">according to Pew</a>.

And this is good for some parents with kids under 12, as a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354998/covid-vaccine-young-child.aspx">recent Gallup poll</a> found that 55 percent of these parents said they would vaccinate their kids pending the FDA’s approval. And as the delta variant <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/22/delta-dominant-variant-mu-who/">continues to spread</a>, 53 percent of parents of children under 18 were worried their child would contract the virus, and pluralities of parents of school-aged children said schools should require all students (47 percent) and teachers and staff (49 percent) to mask up.</li><li>The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine">approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine</a> on Aug. 23, and according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355073/vaccinated-delta-surge-fda-decision.aspx">September survey from Gallup</a>, 75 percent of U.S. adults said they were fully or partially vaccinated. And for the first time since Gallup began polling this question in January, a majority of Republicans (56 percent) were now fully or partially vaccinated. The share of vaccinated Republicans grew 6 percentage points since August. By comparison, 92 percent of Democrats were fully or partially vaccinated.</li><li>John Kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate, said every country needs to act fast on climate change in a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/weve-speed-top-us-climate-negotiator-john-kerry/story?id=80194945">recent interview with ABC News</a> ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference.

A median of 56 percent of people polled thought their own society was doing a good job handling global climate change. But that doesn’t mean they were confident that this action would make a difference. The same survey found that a median of 52 percent of those polled were not confident that efforts by the international community would significantly reduce the effects of climate change.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, the FBI released nationwide crime statistics for 2020, which will likely contribute to the already tense political debate over crime and policing. <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-crime-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The data</a> showed a nearly 30 percent increase in murders compared with the year prior, the largest spike since national record-keeping began in 1960. Nevertheless, murder rates are significantly below what they were throughout the 1990s. Overall, violent crime increased by nearly 6 percent, while property crimes went down by 8 percent. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There aren’t many people like Taylor Bird in today’s Democratic Party. A former megachurch employee who has worked with various evangelical churches and organizations for the past decade, the 32-year-old from Lake Forest, California, is a politically progressive white evangelical Christian who believes in addressing systemic racism, protecting the vulnerable by masking up during the COVID-19 pandemic, tackling climate change and making it as easy as possible for immigrants to become U.S. citizens — both as a matter of faith and politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bird told me Jesus was “the ultimate progressive” because he “cared especially for marginalized groups like the poor, ethnic minorities and others who have been oppressed by society.” That’s why in 2015 and 2016, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/09/13/439833719/true-believer-why-donald-trump-is-the-choice-of-the-religious-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evangelicals largely started to accept</a> Donald Trump as their preferred presidential candidate, Bird felt as though he were living in an alternate reality. “I was looking at people I really respected as faithful Christians embracing this political candidate who was saying all these racist, authoritarian and outrageous things,” Bird said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bird has since chosen to distance himself from what he calls “the evangelical mainstream.” To be sure, though, he — and white evangelicals like him — remains in the minority. White evangelicals in the U.S. are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/08/rapid-decline-white-evangelical-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the decline</a>, however, making up just about <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 percent of Americans overall</a>, per a 2020 Public Religion Research Institute census of American religion. But despite people like Bird, white evangelicals are still the single largest ethnic-religious group among Republican voters. In 2016, the Pew Research Center found that 77 percent of white evangelicals <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=21-06-30%20Validated%20voters%202020%20report%20GEN%20DIST&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=8768&amp;lea=1873968&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for Trump</a>; in 2020, that number jumped to 84 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, some evidence suggests that as white evangelicals <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/15/more-white-americans-adopted-than-shed-evangelical-label-during-trump-presidency-especially-his-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solidified their religious beliefs</a> during Trump’s presidency, the number of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-and-more-americans-arent-religious-why-are-democrats-ignoring-these-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religiously affiliated Democrats declined</a>. Per Pew’s 2014 Religious Landscape Study, 54 percent of religiously <em>unaffiliated</em> people <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/party-affiliation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were Democrats or leaned that way</a> — <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up from 20 percent in 2009</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond Trump’s influence on the Republican Party, I wanted to understand why some white evangelicals have gravitated toward the Democratic Party, especially since they must wrestle with positions that can challenge their faith — like supporting abortion rights. I looked at polling data from past elections, researched issues important to evangelicals and spoke with five white evangelicals who identify as progressive or Democratic-leaning independents and learned that some of them haven’t fully fleshed out their views on certain reproductive health issues that have not only long guided Republican policy decisions but even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/03/evangelical-voters-will-almost-surely-vote-for-donald-trump-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompted many Christians to support the GOP</a> in the first place. Of the five people I spoke with, a few are former Republicans themselves or previously voted for Republican presidential candidates but think Trump’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/donald-trump-big-lie-explainer/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antidemocratic policies</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racist-racism-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist rhetoric went too far</a>; plus, a few say they don’t believe enough members of the Republican Party are doing enough to stand up for values that have been traditionally important to Christians. Yet despite often being more progressive in their views than other white evangelicals (largely thanks to Trump and Trumpism), a few told me that they’d consider voting Republican again should the party undergo a major facelift and disavow the former president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">White evangelicals’ devotion to the GOP is often treated as gospel, but this is a relatively new phenomenon. For a long time, evangelical Christians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/religion-politics-evangelicals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weren’t really active in American politics</a>. But that changed when Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, ran for president in 1976 with his <a href="https://www.anselm.edu/new-hampshire-institute-politics/blog/jimmy-carter-and-year-evangelicals-reconsidered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian faith front and center</a>. He was largely recognized as the first “<a href="https://www.thearda.com/timeline/events/event_44.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born-again</a>” president and ran his campaign on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-balmer-redeemer-president-buttigieg-booker-20190329-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the promise that he would</a> “never knowingly lie to the American people,” which fueled a brief but powerful emergence of a progressive evangelicalism movement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, many political scientists credit evangelicals with helping <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/jimmy_carters_evangelical_downfall_reagan_religion_and_the_1980_presidential_election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carter win the presidency</a>. That era of goodwill was short-lived, however. Disillusioned with Carter’s handling of certain social issues, many evangelicals <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/05/18/the_evangelical_presidency_reagans_dangerous_love_affair_with_the_christian_right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched their allegiance</a> to Ronald Reagan, the Republican presidential nominee four years later. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You cannot understand the movement of white evangelicals into the Republican Party without understanding their larger sense of cultural grievance,” said <a href="https://www.ou.edu/cas/history/people/faculty/steven-m-gillon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven M. Gillon</a>, a professor of history at the University of Oklahoma. “There were lots of specific issues that pushed them to get involved in politics — whether it be taxes, race or abortion — but the driving force that led them to abandon Carter and the Democrats and embrace Reagan was a sense that their cultural and political power was under assault by groups — women, gays and African Americans — that were now firmly entrenched in the Democratic Party. White evangelicals and the Republican Party had the same enemies. It is the one constant feature in their relationship from Reagan to Trump.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And since Reagan’s presidency, evangelicals have been consistently loyal to the GOP. As of 2020, nearly 34 percent of Republicans (including those who lean toward the GOP) were white evangelicals, compared with just 7 percent who identified as or leaned toward the Democrats. </p>

According to a December 2019<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-immigration-8d3eb99934accc2ad795aca0183290a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-immigration-8d3eb99934accc2ad795aca0183290a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion remains a major issue</a> for most white evangelicals. Sixty-seven percent told AP-NORC that they supported significant restrictions on abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s life, compared with just 37 percent of all Americans who felt the same way. Moreover, 80 percent of white evangelicals said <a href="https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/APNORC_Religion_2019-12-31_r1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religion should have “a lot” or “some” influence</a> on the government’s abortion policy. By comparison, just 41 percent of Americans said the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But abortion wasn’t as cut-and-dried for the progressive evangelicals I spoke with. Bird, for example, said that his views on abortion had evolved over time but he ultimately believed in a woman’s right to choose;<em> </em>as a man, he said he didn’t feel comfortable weighing in on health decisions that didn’t affect him directly. A chief financial officer for a major religious organization who prefers to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution for his political opinions told me that he hadn’t fully grappled with his beliefs on abortion rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“From a moral standpoint, I think it is wrong for a person to choose to have a fetus removed from their body. But I also think it’s probably wrong for a government to do anything about a person who chooses to do that,” he said. “God designed the process the way he designed it for a reason: While the choice a person makes might not be the one God wants them to make and may not be the optimal moral choice, I’m not sure the government should have a say in the process, either.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kristi Robertts, a 43-year-old from Lindenhurst, Illinois, holds a similar stance on the issue. She says it has been a journey for her to figure out where she stands on abortion. She is not sure she’ll feel the same way years down the line, but as of today, she considers herself “holistically pro-whole life.” Robertts told me she finds abortion “grotesque” and wishes no woman would ever have to get one, but she also said she’s “pro-woman” and recognizes a woman’s right to have autonomy over her body. “I don’t believe we’ll ever reduce abortion by restriction and oppression,” she said. “This is not a black-and-white issue.” Meanwhile, Jordan Parshall, 24, from Chicago, said he doesn’t spend much time thinking about abortion but  added that while he “doesn’t necessarily like abortion,” it’s not his place to judge those who have had one. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, these stances on abortion are not the norm among white evangelicals: A solid majority say they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-immigration-8d3eb99934accc2ad795aca0183290a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support making abortion illegal</a> in most cases. In fact, some of the progressive evangelicals I spoke with said they had friends or family members who supported Trump in 2016 and 2020 because<em> </em>he had promised to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usher in a conservative Supreme Court</a> that could <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/07/02/trump-makes-clear-roe-v-wade-is-on-the-chopping-block/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially dismantle Roe v. Wade</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But abortion wasn’t what mattered most to the people I interviewed. Instead, the two parties’ positions on health care, racism, climate change and immigration mattered more and, in many cases, led them to support Democratic candidates — although Trump’s presidency also played a significant role in turning them away from the GOP. Over the past five or so years, they said, pro-Trump Republicans had become more antidemocratic, and as a result, Democratic candidates now aligned more with their own political beliefs. Thirty-year-old Jason McCormick, for example, even moved to New Zealand shortly after Trump was elected in 2016 and has no immediate plans to return to the U.S., either. Robertts said she left the GOP in 2016 because<em> </em>of Trump’s presidency and held fairly progressive views now, especially on immigration, health care and racism and reparations. </p>

For most white evangelicals, the top issues as of 2016 were national security and government corruption. But among those who had moved away from the larger evangelical community, many attributed this departure to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/16/theyre-rapists-presidents-trump-campaign-launch-speech-two-years-later-annotated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s attitudes and policies toward immigrants</a> or his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/looting-starts-shooting-starts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handling of the protests</a> that rocked the world following <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-guilty-verdict-for-derek-chauvin-doesnt-change-the-reality-of-police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the murder of George Floyd</a> in May 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’ve been shifting left on race issues over the last few years, but obviously what our country went through last year with George Floyd was horrific,” said the chief financial officer who wanted to remain anonymous. “Now that I live in a major metropolitan area … and have more friends of all different colors and backgrounds, I just think it’s egregious the ways in which the Republican Party and evangelicals seem to ignore and dismiss issues of race from the public discourse. That is unequivocally something that Jesus would have been bothered by.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, though, none of the white evangelicals I interviewed expressed concerns that they were abandoning their religion by siding with the Democratic Party. In fact, many said they saw their politics and religious identity as going hand-in-hand. “All of my beliefs come down to my conviction that Jesus laid down his life for humankind, so his followers are called to lay down their lives,” Bird said. “In other words, to sacrifice our own needs, wants and comfort for the sake of others.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, disdain for the current GOP, or for Trump, seems the bigger motivator for those I spoke with to go <em>against </em>the GOP as opposed to social issues motivating them to vote <em>for </em>Republicans — as is <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2007/10/15/a-portrait-of-republican-social-issue-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often the case with religious voters</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, these progressive evangelicals’ disdain doesn’t mean they aren’t critical of Democrats. In fact, since some of the evangelicals I spoke with cited Trump as the main reason why they hadn’t voted Republican, at least one said he might consider voting for the GOP again should the party eventually distance itself from Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/gop-critics-of-trumps-big-lie-are-struggling-to-win-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t seem as if the GOP is headed in that direction</a> anytime soon, though, but the CFO I spoke with stressed that parties change over time. “If I didn’t say that I’d least consider Republicans moving forward, then I would not be a critical thinker and I’d be a closed-minded person,” he said. “Both the Republican and Democratic parties now are much different than they were 60 years ago.” In the near term, though, he’ll probably continue voting for Democrats. Other progressive evangelicals I spoke to, like Parshall and Robertts, said they were far less inclined to ever support the GOP again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, these white evangelicals are still very much in the minority. During Trump’s presidency, more white Americans adopted the evangelical label than shed it: Among all white adults whom <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/15/more-white-americans-adopted-than-shed-evangelical-label-during-trump-presidency-especially-his-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew surveyed in both 2016 and 2020</a>, the share who described themselves as born-again or evangelical Protestants jumped 4 percentage points — from 25 percent in 2016 to 29 percent last year. Yet some of the progressive evangelicals I spoke with were optimistic that there were more white evangelicals like them than we might realize. “There was a point in my life when I didn’t know anybody like me and would actually sit back in judgment and say you can’t be a ‘real Christian’ and progressive at the same time,” Robertts said. “But in the last five to six years, I have seen how extraordinarily untrue that is and met people who are like-minded. And I think that, in time, our little section will grow and grow and grow.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Once a year, members of Congress take a break from delivering grandiose speeches and passing historic legislation to do something significantly more humbling: play baseball. On Wednesday evening, Democrats and Republicans will face off in the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/Congressional-Baseball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Baseball Game</a>, an annual event<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the game was &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/07/16/canceled-annual-congressional-baseball-game-takes-a-hit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; last year for the first time in 60 years on account of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> that raises <a href="https://time.com/4820569/steve-scalise-shooting-congressional-baseball-game-raises-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> for charity. Though the play is something less than major league quality, the game is beloved enough to fill the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/nationals/tickets/congressional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower seating bowl</a> at Nationals Park, inspire <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creative signs and cheers</a>, and even <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-calculated-advanced-stats-for-the-congressional-baseball-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attract its own sabermetricians</a>.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the stats entering this year’s game, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugXP6qar3m3jmKtjsUp-AFWLyVeQOOK-3b9DblPTRks/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;look no further&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the appeal of the Congressional Baseball Game is that it lets some of the most powerful people in the world unburden themselves for a night and enjoy participating in the national pastime. But we wondered: What if these political players had the same clout in their favorite sport as they have in their day jobs? What if the people who write the laws of the land also wrote the rules of Major League Baseball?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So we asked them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We contacted the offices of all <a href="https://www.congressionalbaseball.org/teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 Democrats and 38 Republicans</a> on this year’s rosters and sent them seven questions about the biggest debates in Major League Baseball — everything from bat flips to bringing the designated hitter to the National League. Nineteen of them<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic Reps. Mike Doyle, Jared Huffman, Tom Malinowski, Joe Morelle, Jimmy Panetta and Ed Perlmutter and Sen. Chris Murphy; Republican Reps. Mike Bost, Tim Burchett, Kat Cammack, Chuck Fleischmann, Mike Garcia, Kevin Hern, John Moolenaar, Barry Moore, Blake Moore, Pete Sessions, Greg Steube and Brad Wenstrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> got back to us — a 28 percent response rate that any pollster these days <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/27/response-rates-in-telephone-surveys-have-resumed-their-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would envy</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it turns out that members of Congress — Republicans and Democrats alike — are traditionalists. (As Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski put it, “I am a politics liberal but a baseball conservative.”) Though they’re OK with some of the cultural changes that have reshaped the game in recent years, they’re broadly opposed to the new or proposed rules that are currently hot topics in the league. What’s more, their opinions on baseball matters often run counter to the preferences of their constituents — the American people!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First off, 13 of the 19 congresspeople we surveyed (68 percent) opposed the universal DH and wanted pitchers to continue hitting in the National League.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six who supported it were Malinowksi, Moolenaar, Barry Moore, Sessions, Steube and Wenstrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> “One of the things that makes baseball unique is that there are differences between the American and National League,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told FiveThirtyEight. Republican Rep. Blake Moore agreed and used data to back up his point: “The World Series win count since 1973, when the designated hitter was implemented, is essentially equal between leagues (25 American League wins, 22 National League wins). These data suggest there is no inherent advantage for one league over the other.” Republican Rep. Brad Wenstrup, however, reluctantly disagreed. “I personally would like the AL to adopt pitcher hitting, rather than have the NL cave. But the rules should be the same.” And Wenstrup can rest easy knowing the public is on his side: A March 2021 <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wave-57-Data-Tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harris/The Athletic poll</a> found that 59 percent of adults who followed MLB supported bringing the DH to the National League, while only 41 percent opposed it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Second, 12 of the 19 (63 percent) said they disliked the new rule that each game in a doubleheader lasts only seven innings<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five said they liked it — Burchett, Doyle, Blake Moore, Perlmutter and Steube — while Hern and Barry Moore were unsure or skipped this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> — even though, ironically, the Congressional Baseball Game itself is only seven innings long. “Seven inning contests involving a ball and bat are called softball games,” Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle insisted. “I don’t think Ernie Banks was ever heard to [say], ‘let’s play two — as long as they’re only seven innings each!’” However, Morelle’s own manager on the Democratic team, Rep. Mike Doyle, disagreed with this succinct note: “Have you ever tried to sit through a double-header … BORING!” For what it’s worth, the fans are on Doyle’s side: 70 percent of respondents to the Harris/The Athletic poll said they agreed with MLB’s decision to shorten doubleheaders in 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, 12 of our 19 respondents (63 percent) said they weren’t a fan of the new rule in which extra innings begin with a runner already on second base<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six people who were OK with the change were Cammack, Hern, Blake Moore, Murphy, Panetta and Steube. Barry Moore didn’t answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> — and many of them felt strongly about it. Malinowski let out an audible shudder when we asked him this question over the phone. And Morelle quipped, “The innovator who created the rule that places runners on second base to start extra innings must have been the same genius that devised mini games for doubleheaders. … This is the classic case of a solution searching for a problem.” Fans oppose this rule change too: According to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/07/23/ahead-of-2020s-first-pitch-baseball-fans-largely-approve-of-mlb-rule-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> from July 2020 (just before the rule was implemented), only 34 percent of MLB fans had a favorable opinion of it, while 42 percent had an unfavorable one. Moore, though, proposed an interesting compromise: “I would prefer that rule to start after the 12th inning, and never during playoff elimination games.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Opposition ran even stronger to our fourth question: whether home-plate umpires should be replaced by an automated system to call balls and strikes. Seventeen of the 19 congressional baseball players (89 percent) said no.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huffman and Morelle were the two who liked the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> “You can’t kick dirt on a balls and strikes machine,” Malinowski explained, echoing the sentiment of several other members. According to Harris/The Athletic, this is a divisive idea among followers of MLB, too, although it enjoys significantly stronger support with them (51 percent) than it does in Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And virtually no one liked the idea of moving the pitching mound back to encourage offense: 16 (84 percent) were against it, and the other three<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Moore, Blake Moore and Murphy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> didn’t express a definitive opinion either way. Ever the manager, Doyle feared that pitchers’ “arms would fall off!” Meanwhile, Morelle contended, “There’s magic in the 60 feet, 6 inches of distance between the pitcher’s mound and the plate! I would however consider lowering the mound.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just when we thought members of Congress were going to oppose every recent change in MLB, they threw us a curveball. Twelve of 19 (63 percent) said they approved of hitters flipping their bats after a big home run. (Only three<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burchett, Garcia and Morelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> said they disapproved, while the other four<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleischmann, Huffman, Panetta and Steube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> had no opinion.) “Baseball needs more fun and less enforcement of stuffy unwritten rules,” Wenstrup declared, and Murphy went so far as to say, “I think it’s one of the best things about baseball.” According to a <a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PPP_Release_National_51216.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Polling survey</a> from May 2016, many MLB fans, especially younger ones, agree: 48 percent overall said they approved of bat flips, while 31 percent disapproved. (Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 79 percent approved and only 9 percent disapproved.) Morelle, though, called bat flipping “amateurish and immature.” He went on to say: “My father admonished me a long time ago whether it was hitting safely in baseball, scoring a touchdown in football, or sinking a fade-away jumper in basketball to ‘act like you’ve done it before.’” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the question over which members of Congress have the most genuine disagreement? Whether advanced metrics have had a net positive or net negative impact on the game. Nine of 19 (47 percent) said positive; five<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burchett, Doyle, Garcia, Huffman and Morelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> (26 percent) said negative; and the other five<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moolenaar, Barry Moore, Blake Moore, Murphy and Wenstrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> didn’t come down one way or the other. “Look, I loved ‘Moneyball,’” Moore wrote in an email. “But the reason the Oakland A’s were so good that year was because they had three of the best aces in baseball (Mulder, Zito, &amp; Hudson). It wasn’t solely because of On Base Percentage.” Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman felt like “some of the soul of the game is lost when it becomes all about the numbers and the data.” And Doyle came out against sabermetrics too. “I’m old school,” the Democratic manager explained.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Several of the congresspeople we contacted were so excited to talk about baseball that they didn’t want to stop at just the seven questions we asked. For instance, Wenstrup signed off with a succinct three-point platform: “Fire Manfred. <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/4/20/22394351/pete-rose-major-league-baseball-hall-of-fame" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let Pete in</a>. And bring back ten cent beer night.” And Malinowski spoke out, unprompted, against the infield shift — something that divides MLB fans exactly 50-50, according to the Harris/The Athletic poll. “I think infielders, like Americans, are shifting too far left and right, and I’d like to see them more down the middle,” he opined.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Several congressional baseball players also lamented that MLB games these days are too slow, with two (Murphy and Morelle) advocating specifically for a pitch clock. “Pitchers used to get the ball back from the catcher and get ready to throw again. Today you can send out for pizza, wash the car, take a shower, and not miss a pitch,” Morelle complained. “Please, for the love of all that is holy institute a pitch clock!” Then, no doubt speaking for all our interviewees, he concluded: “I hope I can now look forward to a call from the Commissioner’s Office!” Considering that multiple MLB commissioners actually started their careers in politics, perhaps Rob Manfred should be looking over his shoulder.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Two factions of the Democratic Party in Congress are currently playing tug-of-war over the centerpieces of President Biden’s legislative agenda. Moderate Democrats have balked at the proposed $3.5 trillion reconciliation budget bill, attempting to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay a vote on it in the House</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/manchin-favors-trimming-biden-budget-plan-half-79977681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insisting that the price tag will have to come down in the Senate</a>. At the same time, House progressives have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/politics/progressives-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-democrats/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened to block</a> a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill unless the reconciliation bill passes first — with the current price tag intact. (The House is scheduled to vote on the infrastructure bill <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pelosi-sets-thursday-vote-passage-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Thursday</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s easy to blow these disagreements out of proportion. On one hand, they are certainly relevant in that they threaten to derail two potentially transformative pieces of legislation. But they do not mean that Democrats are a hopelessly — or even significantly — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/21/democrats-biden-domestic-agenda-implode-513218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divided party</a>. Instead, it’s really the narrowness of Democrats’ congressional majorities that makes passing big legislation difficult, as even a small number of defectors can make the difference in a bill passing or failing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, the number of House moderates who attempted to hold up the reconciliation bill last month was only nine — enough to make the difference in a tight chamber, yes, but a drop in the bucket compared with the entire Democratic caucus, and plenty of moderate Democrats in the House <em>didn’t</em> stand in the way. (The progressive dissent may be more widespread — one congressman <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahnferris/status/1442901307346456577?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that “dozens” of progressive votes were on the fence — but it’s hard to know how seriously to take these threats, given that only a few representatives have gone public with them.) In addition, more stories will get written over the course of a long negotiation, which can lead to a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-too-much-media-attention-could-hurt-the-democrats-new-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media emphasis on the messy sausage-making process</a> over the (often less acrimonious) outcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, there’s good reason to think that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s current Democratic caucus is the <em>opposite</em> of in disarray. When it comes down to brass tacks, Democrats are (so far) the most united House caucus of the last three sessions of Congress. According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Biden Score</a>, which measures how often individual members of Congress vote in line with Biden’s position, 203 out of the House’s 223 Democrats<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are actually currently only 220 Democrats in the House, but we’re also considering the voting records of former Reps. Marcia Fudge, Deb Haaland and Alcee Hastings, who either resigned or passed away during 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> have voted with Biden 100 percent of the time, and all but two have voted with him at least 90 percent of the time. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This makes the current Democratic caucus far more cohesive than both the current Republican caucus and the Democratic caucus during the 115th Congress (based on the Biden and Trump scores<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-the-trump-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;same concept&lt;/a&gt; as the Biden Score, except measuring agreement with former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> of the median 90 percent of their members), when Democrats were last in the House minority. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Democrats in the House are really united behind Biden" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/csjul/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="424" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">One reason why Democrats have been so unified is that there are <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo25125939.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structural reasons</a> to expect a majority caucus to be more cohesive than a minority one. For one thing, minority-party members’ “votes don’t make or break legislation a lot of the time,” <a href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/gkoger@miami.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregory Koger</a>, a professor of political science at the University of Miami, told FiveThirtyEight, so “there is a little more leeway for them to break with their party.” For another, majority-party members (especially when the president is also of that party) have a clear electoral incentive to get things done. “All Democrats — regardless of whether they’re moderate or progressive — really need the Biden administration to succeed,” said <a href="http://www.blochrubin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruth Bloch Rubin</a>, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. But on the other hand, the minority party has “competing incentives: They want the president to look ineffective but also want to bring things home to their district.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps most importantly, the majority party also has an advantage in that it sets the congressional agenda, and congressional leaders don’t typically bring bills to the floor unless they are sure they are going to pass. As a result, only bills with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad support within the caucus</a> get voted on, making the majority party look more cohesive than it would if the minority party was calling the shots. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some ways, however, this is a key shortcoming of our Biden Scores: They don’t measure the votes not taken or what goes on behind the scenes. “In historical cases, a lot of really important negotiation happens before legislation hits the floor,” said Bloch Rubin. “Not to undercut the value of looking at final votes … but a lot of the time that’s not where the most important action is.” In fact, a real-life example of that is unfolding before our eyes right now in the Senate, where it’s likely that the opposition of moderate Sen. Joe Manchin will force Democrats to lop off a trillion dollars or two from the reconciliation bill. (Manchin, though known as one of the biggest internal thorns in Democrats’ sides, has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/joe-manchin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 percent Biden Score</a>.) A similar dance occurred with Democrats’ voting-rights bill earlier this year: The For the People Act was <a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/opinion/op_ed_commentaries/joe-manchin-why-im-voting-against-the-for-the-people-act/article_c7eb2551-a500-5f77-aa37-2e42d0af870f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too far-reaching for Manchin’s tastes</a>, so it was pared down into the less ambitious <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/revised-democratic-voting-bill-drops-controversial-provisions-tweaks-others-as-pressure-for-action-mounts/2021/09/14/6c59def8-150a-11ec-9589-31ac3173c2e5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom to Vote Act</a>, which Manchin helped craft and is now likely to support.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">So it makes good sense that Democrats in the 117th Congress are more united than Republicans are in the 117th or Democrats were in the 115th. But it doesn’t explain why they are <em>even more united </em>than the Republican majority was in 2017-18. During that 115th Congress, the middle 90 percent of Republicans (so again disregarding the outliers in the top and bottom 5 percent) had <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump Scores</a> between 81 and 99 percent. That 18-point range is not nearly as narrow as the 3-point range that separates the middle 90 percent of the current Democratic caucus. Put another way, Republicans were a bit more cohesive when they had the majority than they are now — but Democrats are <em>a lot</em> more cohesive now than when they were in the minority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why have Democrats been so successful at keeping their caucus in line? Koger sees <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4620079" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two reasons</a>: the fact that Democrats’ majority is so narrow (there are only <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight more Democrats</a> in the House than Republicans) and Republican opposition to the Democratic agenda. “If Pelosi could count on 20, 30 or 40 percent of Republicans to vote for a bill, there would be less pressure on Democrats to unite,” Koger said. But now, “when the majority party wants to do something, that typically involves corralling all its members.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, a larger majority means leadership has a wider margin of error; they can afford to not whip votes as aggressively or to allow members to vote their conscience (or cast a vote that might be more defensible to their constituents). But when a House majority is this narrow, there is more pressure to toe the party line. “It’s a lot of pressure to go out on the floor and sink a vote,” <a href="https://www.mattglassman.com/?page_id=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Glassman</a>, a former congressional staffer and now a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute, told FiveThirtyEight. “Everyone knows they <em>can</em> do it, but everyone’s terrified of doing it.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As such, both Bloch Rubin and Glassman expressed skepticism that progressives would ultimately scuttle the infrastructure bill. “They all want this infrastructure bill to pass,” said Bloch Rubin, and Glassman likened the negotiations to a performance where “everyone is trying to get to yes” but publicly threatens to vote no in order to “move policies incrementally closer to where they want them to be.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this, progressive Democrats differ from their far-right counterparts in the House Freedom Caucus, who are more doctrinaire and willing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/12/15769282/conservatives-threat-budget-trump-tax-reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">torpedo their party’s agenda</a> — for instance, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/18/farm-bill-fails-597661" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting down a 2018 farm bill</a> because then-House Speaker Paul Ryan did not first hold a vote on a controversial immigration bill. “The progressive caucus has never really wanted to take the next step and fight stuff on the floor,” Glassman said. “[They] work within the system.” This fundamental difference between the parties’ extreme flanks is another big reason why this Democratic majority is more cohesive than the last Republican one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pelosi, who has a reputation as a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/06/851343192/understanding-nancy-pelosi-she-knows-exactly-what-her-leverage-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener">master legislative tactician</a>, deserves some credit as well. “I would hardly say that structural factors alone are doing the work,” said Bloch Rubin. “She knows how to play her cards well.” In fact, Glassman told us that Pelosi’s unique strength isn’t in whipping votes; instead, both he and Bloch Rubin pointed to her ability to manage the factions within the Democratic coalition. Her job is essentially negotiator-in-chief, “making sure all members of the coalition are OK with the outcome,” Glassman said. “And I think Pelosi is very skilled at making sure everyone gets just enough of what they want.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ironically, though, an open negotiation process like the one Democrats are currently in can leave outside observers with the impression that a party is divided even if the legislation being debated ultimately succeeds. “It’s very hard to tell the difference between a caucus that’s in disarray and one that’s in the late stages of bargaining with each other,” Glassman said. “The visible evidence is the same.” Media coverage of the negotiations usually doesn’t help matters, either; according to <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo25681072.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research by political scientist Mary Layton Atkinson</a>, the press covers controversial legislation far more often than it does bipartisan legislation, and that coverage generally focuses on the conflict and drama of the negotiations over the substance of the bill. To Bloch Rubin, though, this type of coverage misses the broader point that Pelosi has proven adept at steering Democrats’ squabbling factions toward an outcome that actually benefits her party in the end.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Glassman identified one other reason why Democrats appreciate and appear so unified under her: “She protects them from votes they don’t want to take on the floor.” In other words, she is good at agenda-setting and not holding votes until negotiations are complete. We saw an example of this just days ago: The infrastructure vote was actually originally scheduled for Monday, but Pelosi postponed it until Thursday in order to buy more time for negotiations. “I'm never bringing to the floor a bill that doesn't have the votes,” she <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-delay-vote-senate-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill/story?id=80232564" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained to ABC News</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">All this is not to say you should ignore the very real policy differences between Democrats’ moderate and progressive flanks. (For one thing, they’ll continue to be an important fissure in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic primaries</a> in 2022 and 2024.) But those divisions popping up in Congress does not necessarily make Democrats ineffective at governing. Negotiations, by definition, highlight disagreements, but the final proof will be in whether Democrats pass the infrastructure bill on Thursday (and, on some later date, the reconciliation bill). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, it’s possible for a party to <em>have divisions</em> but not <em>be divided</em> — and a strong congressional leader like Pelosi can make that happen. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden hasn’t been shy about undoing the legacy of his immediate predecessor. It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFUgU1v-XiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rallying cry of his presidential campaign</a>, and as such it has defined his first eight months in office. On Biden’s first day in the White House, he signaled climate change would once again be a top issue by bringing the United States <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/inauguration-day-live-updates/2021/01/20/958923821/biden-moves-to-have-u-s-rejoin-climate-accord" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back into the 2015 Paris Agreement</a>, which Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrawn from</a> when he was president. Biden also reversed Trump’s ban on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/politics/lloyd-austin-transgender-military-harris-biden/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transgender Americans serving in the military</a> and has taken a number of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/biden-rescind-1776-commission-executive-order/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steps</a> to <a href="https://law.ucla.edu/news/biden-reverses-trump-executive-order-banning-diversity-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repudiate</a> a president who made <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/storming-the-u-s-capitol-was-about-maintaining-white-power-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white identity politics</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-rise-of-white-identity-politics-explains-the-fight-over-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial resentment</a> central to his message.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One notable exception is how Biden has handled America’s relationship with China. On this issue, Biden has hardly distanced himself from Trump: In fact, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/world/asia/china-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s tough-on-China approach has arguably been even tougher</a>. Biden has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/biden-china-tariffs-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept in place</a> many of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/09/13/meet-new-china-strategy-same-old-china-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the much-maligned Trump tariffs</a>. He’s also <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-china-covid-origin-report-b1910207.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harshly criticized China</a> for its role in handling the coronavirus outbreak. And he’s taken to task its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/china-genocide-human-rights-report/2021/03/30/b2fa8312-9193-11eb-9af7-fd0822ae4398_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human rights track record</a> and<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/parting-shot-trump-administration-declares-chinas-repression-uighurs-genocide-2021-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> expressed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/us/politics/biden-china-taiwan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for an independent Taiwan</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trump-biden-taiwan-china/2021/01/13/1bbadee0-53c0-11eb-acc5-92d2819a1ccb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two things</a> the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trump-biden-taiwan-china/2021/01/13/1bbadee0-53c0-11eb-acc5-92d2819a1ccb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump administration</a> also did, albeit at the last minute.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are, of course, important differences between Trump and Biden; namely, Biden is far <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/09/us-uk-australia-china/620094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more multilateral</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/world/asia/climate-china-us-kerry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooperative</a> in his approach to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/04/26/what-does-bidens-first-100-days-tell-us-about-his-approach-to-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign policy</a> in general. By and large, though, Biden’s approach to China has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-china-policy-is-emergingand-it-looks-a-lot-like-trumps-11623330000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resembled that of Trump’s</a>, which is notable in our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeply polarized political era</a> when moments of consensus between the two major parties are rare. That said, Republicans and Democrats are still considerably divided over what America’s relationship with China should look like, which is why U.S.-China relations are unlikely to create an opportunity for bipartisanship going forward, even if both parties consider China an adversary. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To understand why Biden’s approach to China is often considered “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-23/bloomberg-new-economy-when-it-comes-to-china-biden-is-trump-2-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump 2.0</a>,” it’s important to first establish Americans’ attitudes toward China. Broadly speaking, Americans of all political stripes don’t view the country favorably. Though Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/07/30/americans-fault-china-for-its-role-in-the-spread-of-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disagree</a> as to whether the Chinese government should be held responsible for the role it played in the coronavirus outbreak, Americans’ feelings toward the country <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-blaming-china-for-the-pandemic-probably-wont-help-trump-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have gotten worse</a> since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center</a> in February found that two-thirds of Americans — including 79 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of Democrats<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes Republican-leaning independents and Democratic-leaning independents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> — harbored “somewhat cold” or “very cold” feelings toward China,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents indicated their feelings using a “feeling thermometer,” where a rating of zero degrees means they feel as cold and negative as possible, a rating of 100 degrees means they feel as warm and positive as possible, and a rating of 50 degrees means they don’t feel particularly positive or negative toward China. “Cold” ratings ran between 0 and 49, and “warm” ratings ran between 51 and 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> and a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1627/china.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February survey from Gallup</a> found that 79 percent of Americans overall said their opinion of China was “mostly” or “very” unfavorable — by far the highest level of disfavor the polling firm has found since it started asking the question in 1979. That includes 41 percent of Americans who said they viewed China “very” unfavorably, up from 24 percent the year before.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans have become less happy with China" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AFXVN/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, though, it appears that China’s atrocious record on human rights, rather than its handling of COVID-19, accounts for more of the public’s dislike, which transcends parties. In fact, when asked by Pew to identify the first thing that comes to mind when they think about China, one-fifth of Americans — including 22 percent of Democrats and 21 percent of Republicans — said they thought about “human rights.” By contrast, just 7 percent of Americans said they immediately thought of COVID-19.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In recent years, China has come under fire for its harsh repression of political dissidents and ethnic and religious minorities, perhaps most notably <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/12/surviving-the-crackdown-in-xinjiang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Uyghurs in northwest China</a>. The Chinese government has been accused of engineering a campaign of mass internment and sterilization of Uyghurs, using a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/china-ai-surveillance/614197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sophisticated system of wide-spread surveillance</a> to carry out the abuses. The U.S. Senate has responded, in part, by passing separate bipartisan measures <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/menendez-cornyn-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-to-designate-uyghur-human-rights-abuses-by-china-as-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">labeling the treatment of Uyghurs a genocide</a> and banning the import of goods — alleged to be manufactured with forced labor — <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57847912" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from China’s Xinjiang region</a>. The Senate also allowed sanctions against China for human rights violations as part of a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/06/08/senate-china-science-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$250 billion bill</a> passed in June.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Democrats and Republicans favor a “tough on China” approach when it comes to addressing those abuses, too. According to Pew’s February survey, 69 percent of Democrats and 72 percent of Republicans support promoting human rights in China even if it hurts economic ties between the United States and China. By contrast, only 29 percent of Democrats and 24 percent of Republicans favor strengthening economic relations even if it entails not addressing human rights. And though there’s been less polling on Americans’ views of China-Taiwan relations, clear majorities of Americans support recognizing Taiwan as an independent country, including it in international organizations and signing a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement, according to a <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/2021%20Taiwan%20Brief.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July survey from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, though, many Americans also view China as a serious economic threat. Roughly 9 in 10 Americans would describe China as a “competitor” or an “enemy,” while only 9 percent consider it a “partner,” according to Pew’s February survey. Half of Americans also thought that China — not the United States — was the world’s leading economic power, per Gallup, and over 60 percent of Americans believed that China’s economic power would pose a “critical” threat to the United States over the next 10 years. Lawmakers in Washington have taken notice, as well, with the Senate’s $250 billion June bill heavily investing in science and technology so that the United States can stay competitive with China. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, however, Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are generally skeptical</a> of the net benefit that tariffs, including those on goods from China, provide the United States, with 44 percent of Americans saying the measures were bad and 30 percent saying they were good (23 percent thought they had no net effect), according to Pew’s February survey. Republicans were not only more pro-tariff than Democrats but also more likely to support a tougher economic approach to China more generally.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just a question of how tough to be economically toward China, either. There are some fairly clear limits to bipartisanship when it comes to addressing China’s ascendancy. Roughly half of Republicans in that February Pew survey thought of China “as an enemy” of the United States, while only one-fifth of Democrats felt the same way. And according to a <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/report_2020ccs_americadivided_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 2020 survey from the Chicago Council</a>, strong majorities of Republicans supported significantly reducing trade between the United States and China, even if American consumers have to pay more for goods; restricting the exchange of scientific research between the two countries; and limiting the number of Chinese students studying in the United States. Democrats, meanwhile, were by and large opposed to all three proposals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a long-term foreign policy goal, curbing China’s influence also ranks as a higher priority for rank-and-file Republicans than Democrats: 63 percent of Republicans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think that the U.S. should make it a top priority to limit the power and influence</a> of China, while just 36 percent of Democrats agree. To that end, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/14/members-of-congress-especially-republicans-are-increasingly-discussing-china-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew found in a July report</a> that members of Congress — particularly Republicans — grew more outspoken about China on social media in 2020, often using accusatory language surrounding the pandemic or intellectual property theft. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The biggest difference [between Biden and Trump on China] is that the Trump administration was more unilateralist and even weakened some of our alliances and partnerships, but the Biden administration has come in determined to build coalitions with the countries that share our values and interests,” said <a href="https://www.gmfus.org/find-experts/bonnie-s-glaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bonnie Glaser</a>, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet still, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de6a5d8d-3745-4b07-96ff-0a0d59380f9e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some have argued</a> that an ascendant China <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/opinion/china-economy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be just the kickstart</a> that America <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-12-03/china-challenge-can-help-america-avert-decline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needs</a> to escape an era of hyper-partisanship. But though there is significant room for bipartisan agreement on some of the issues surrounding China in American politics, it is not clear that this is enough for U.S.-China relations to really become a bipartisan issue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.rachelmyrick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel Myrick</a>, a professor of political science at Duke University, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/abs/do-external-threats-unite-or-divide-security-crises-rivalries-and-polarization-in-american-foreign-policy/85C21E7EBD9EB38EDDB95F68A0458A88" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has found in her research</a> that security threats from foreign foes don’t consistently reduce polarization. Looking across dozens of cases since the start of the 20th century, Myrick found little evidence that such threats reduced polarization; rather, she found that the responses to these threats often reflected already existing partisan dynamics. The assumption that a rising China will bring about domestic unity, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/04/democrats-republicans-seem-agree-about-one-foreign-policy-point-getting-tough-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myrick argued</a> in The Washington Post in June, “may be faulty to begin with.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We shouldn’t expect external threats to inherently be unifying,” Myrick wrote in an email to FiveThirtyEight. “That doesn’t mean, however, that there aren’t some threats that will be. Unsurprisingly, the most unifying threats historically have been severe and direct attacks on American soil. In response to the 9/11 attacks, for example, we saw memorable displays of national unity and a sharp drop in polarization.” But, as Myrick pointed out, those types of galvanizing events are few and far between. “Most security crises involving the U.S. tend to have little to no persistent effects on polarization, either among policymakers or among the American public.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for whether the United States would rally around beating back China the way it did with the Soviet Union after World War II, Myrick is not convinced. She pointed to the differences in the domestic political environment from that era to this one, highlighting that while Republicans and Democrats increasingly see China as a threat, they are divided on how to respond. She also pointed out that the United States is far more enmeshed with China economically than it was with the Soviet Union, and that American competition with China is “much less about military power and much more about economic competition.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the dynamics at play here go beyond the narrow scope of American domestic politics. For instance, a lot has to do with what China itself does — if it keeps using economic and military coercion <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/blinken-warns-chinas-increasingly-aggressive-actions-against-taiwan-2021-04-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toward its neighbors</a>, America's posture <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-china-is-responding-to-escalating-strategic-competition-with-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will likely be adversarial</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some experts do think that the tension between China and the U.S. could have a unifying effect. <a href="https://rhg.com/team/jordan-schneider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordan Schneider</a>, a China technology analyst at the Rhodium Group and host of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/448WaJhgJGJKnQ3HCE2EBa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ChinaTalk podcast</a>, told FiveThirtyEight that increased competition with China on issues like climate change is such an example. “If everyone agrees climate change is a problem, this could be something that actually boosts China’s image abroad, and the same thing with Biden,” said Schneider. “So you could end up in a Cold War circa 1960s and ’70s dynamic, where it’s actually the tension that helped push forward some human rights changes both in the Soviet Union and in the U.S., more famously with Civil Rights legislation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Myrick, too, acknowledges there will be <em>some</em> opportunities for bipartisan cooperation on various aspects of U.S.-China policy. “I think we’ll see a fair amount of bipartisanship in the short term on aspects of technology competition, for example.” But she did stress that “[e]xpecting a growing ‘China threat’ to resolve partisan divisions in American politics seems misguided.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of that is to say that even on the issues that Americans seem the least politically divided on, existing partisan polarization is still likely to rule the day — if not factors outside of most Americans’ control. And if the past two decades of foreign policy are any lesson, there’s nothing that says that America's current bipartisan consensus on China is stable — or that it will lead to a less divided United States. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a lot going on in Congress this week, and much of it is existential. The House is scheduled to vote on a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill on Thursday. But some Democratic lawmakers said they wouldn’t vote for the bill without an agreement on a multi-trillion-dollar partisan social programs bill. At the same time, the U.S. risks defaulting on its debt as Republicans refuse to help raise the debt ceiling. Oh, and the government might shut down by week’s end, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew talks about the threat of a government shutdown and how likely they think it will be for Democrats to get their agenda passed on both spending plans, immigration reform and voting rights.

			<title>Texas’s New Congressional Map Could Give A Huge Boost To GOP Incumbents</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, Texas lawmakers <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave a first glimpse</a> at what the state’s new congressional districts may look like. The redrawn map was highly anticipated given that Texas gained two additional congressional seats — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most of any state</a> — during the reapportionment process and because Republicans are fully in control of the state’s redistricting process. Yet the new map, if passed, would not substantially alter the topline partisan breakdown of Texas’s seats. It appears that Republican mapmakers prioritized defending the GOP’s current seat advantage over trying to significantly expand it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/draft_plan_1/"><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TX-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TX-Screenshot-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TX-Screenshot-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TX-Screenshot-1.png?w=1400 2x"></a></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Overall, this map creates 24 solid or likely Republican seats, 13 solid or likely Democratic seats and one swing seat in the Rio Grande Valley. (The state’s two new districts will be placed in the Austin and Houston <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/11/analysis-blue-dots-texas-red-political-sea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metropolitan areas</a>, as those two areas fueled much of the state’s population growth since 2010.) But this isn’t <em>that</em> much different than what Texas’s map currently looks like: At present, the delegation is made up of 23 Republicans and 13 Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is still a very good map for Republicans, though, because mapmakers strengthened the GOP’s advantage in the state by making a number of potentially vulnerable seats held by Republicans much redder, with the newest Houston-area seat also drawn so that it’s favorable to Republican candidates. As the table below shows, the current map has 11 Republican incumbents in seats that were less than 20 points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> But on the new map, all but one Republican-held seat would be R+20 or stronger for the GOP.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Given that the GOP controls the redistricting process in Texas, it might seem strange that it wasn’t more aggressive in trying to flip a seat or two held by Democrats. But population growth and demographic shifts in Texas <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-america-lost-and-gained-population-could-throw-democrats-a-redistricting-lifeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have arguably benefited Democrats</a> so significantly that Republican mapmakers were mostly left playing defense — concerned that some GOP incumbents might soon become vulnerable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the top of that list is Rep. Beth Van Duyne, the only Texas Republican defending a seat that President Biden carried in 2020. The new map lines, however, would shift Van Duyne’s district between Dallas and Fort Worth nearly 20 points to the right, meaning that she likely has far more to worry about in a primary than in a general election now after winning by only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-texas-house-district-24.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.3 points</a> last November. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three other Republican incumbents in seats that were less than R+10 also saw their districts move at least 15 points to the right. Rep. Dan Crenshaw ranks among these members, although it’s not clear which seat he may run in: About one-third of his current district is in the new 38th District, but the same is true of the new 2nd District, too, which may also be open, considering Rep. Kevin Brady of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/politics/kevin-brady-retirement/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current 8th District is retiring</a>. Either way, Crenshaw — <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/02/is-dan-crenshaw-the-future-of-the-gop-225257/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rising star in the GOP</a> — would be far safer than he is now. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Tony Gonzales of the 23rd District is the only Republican incumbent who wouldn’t end up in a seat that’s at least R+20, but his perennial battleground district would be reforged into a relative GOP stronghold: His district would be R+13 under the new lines. Like Van Duyne, Gonzalez would breathe far easier under this new map, after he only won by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-texas-house-district-23.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 points</a> in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In order to make many of these seats safer for Republicans, GOP lawmakers moved more Democratic voters into seats that the <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2021/08/24/lizzie-fletcher-and-colin-allred-are-doomed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP had previously targeted</a> but now seem to have abandoned. For example, the seat held by Democrat Lizzie Fletcher, who <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/06/democrat-lizzie-fletcher-against-texas-gop-congressman-john-culberson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unseated a Republican incumbent</a> in 2018, would go from D+1 to D+25. Meanwhile, the Dallas-area seat represented by Democrat Colin Allred, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/06/democrat-colin-allred-leads-gop-congressman-pete-sessions-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who similarly ousted</a> a Republican incumbent in 2018, would go from D+2 to D+25. It’s a similar story for almost every other Texas Democrat under this plan. (In some instances, Republican mapmakers also made some super-red seats a slightly paler shade, “unpacking” some GOP voters to boost Republican-held seats. For instance, Rep. Van Taylor’s 3rd District outside of Dallas shifted east to take some red turf from Rep. Pat Fallon’s 4th District.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the biggest takeaways from this map is that almost every seat — Democratic or Republican — would be uncompetitive at its baseline. All but two seats would lean at least 10 points more Democratic or Republican than the country as a whole. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s heavily Hispanic South Texas that holds both of those exceptions. This is a potentially important development as that region might hold opportunities for the GOP since Biden performed <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/04/joe-biden-texas-border-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worse there than past Democratic presidential candidates</a>. Most notably, the 15th District, represented by Democrat Vicente Gonzalez, would become more Republican-leaning on the new map. He was already facing a difficult reelection bid, as he narrowly won his 2020 race by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-texas-house-district-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 percentage points</a> after winning reelection by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-house-district-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 points in 2018</a>. But now under the new map, his district would go from D+2 to evenly split. Meanwhile, Rep. Henry Cuellar’s 28th District would actually become slightly bluer — it only moved from D+4 to D+7 — and could be in play in 2022. (Rep. Filemon Vela’s 34th District doesn’t fall neatly into this category because it went from D+5 to D+17, but it is the other border seat in Texas, and it seems to have gotten a little friendlier toward Democrats, although Vela <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/22/texas-filemon-vela-retirement-477441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t seek reelection</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another notable change under the new map is that it would result in a smaller share of districts with Hispanic majorities despite the addition of two new congressional districts. This could make the map vulnerable to a racial gerrymandering lawsuit considering Texas’s Hispanic population has <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/12/texas-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driven the bulk of Texas’s population growth</a> since 2010. According to census data, the current congressional map included 18 districts with white majorities and nine with Hispanic majorities. But the newly proposed map doesn’t give Hispanic voters any more clout: There are now 19 districts that have white majorities and still nine districts with Hispanic majorities, based on the voting age population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is only the first draft of Texas’s new congressional map, so it could still change before it’s passed by the GOP-controlled legislature.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When the suburban Chicago hospital where her mother was being treated for COVID-19 refused to give her ivermectin, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-libertyville-hospital-covid-lawsuit-patient-ivermectin-20210922-g7tjh2sm3fdablpbzomuv26vvu-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiffany Wilson had her moved to another hospital</a>. The antiparasitic drug achieved a cult following as a treatment for COVID-19, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-to-stop-hoping-for-a-covid-19-miracle-cure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite no current evidence</a> it is effective. But that didn’t deter Wilson from suing when the next hospital also refused to give her mother, 68-year-old Leslie Pai, ivermectin. And she won. This week, after the hospital obliged a judge’s injunction ordering it to give Pai ivermectin, Pai’s heart rate plummeted, hospital doctors said in court documents. The hospital pushed back in court, and <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-ivermectin-covid-lawsuit-dropped-libertyville-hospital-20210923-lqwfwls5orcqvdxfjk3lgtyale-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilson dropped the case</a>, with her lawyers asking the court to lift the injunction while continuing to argue that the ivermectin was, in fact, helping. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s most remarkable about Wilson’s story is that it’s not the only one of its kind. In recent months, there have been multiple cases of patients or their families demanding ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19, not only going to court but also harassing hospital staff. And in at least seven instances, judges have granted these requests, ordering hospitals to either administer the drug or allow other physicians into the facility to administer it. These incidents mark a new era of the pandemic: As hospitals struggle under the weight of new COVID-19 cases, they are also being forced to fight this new battle spurred by an avalanche of fear and online misinformation. The infodemic has officially arrived in the ICU. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’ve never encountered this and I’ve been in practice over 40 years,” said Dr. Rodney Hood, who chairs the National Medical Association’s COVID-19 Task Force on Vaccines and Therapeutics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some instances, hospitals refusing to treat patients with ivermectin have faced <a href="https://newstalk941.com/crmc-responds-to-protest-wanting-alternate-covid-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests</a>. One case in particular garnered a sizable public response. In 2016, Veronica Wolski, then a 59-year-old Chicagoan, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-bernie-sanders-bridge-chicago-inc-20161011-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first drew public attention</a> when she waved Bernie Sanders signs from a pedestrian bridge over a highway. Over the last five years, her occupation of the bridge continued but her message shifted to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepeoplesbridge/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote the QAnon conspiracy theory</a>, the Big Lie and anti-vaccine sentiments — endearing her to the alt-right. And then recently, after Wolski was hospitalized with COVID-19, supporters on QAnon-focused Telegram channels shared contact information for the hospital and began a campaign of calling and emailing to demand Wolski receive ivermectin. This was amplified when L. Lin Wood, the pro-Trump lawyer who filed a number of lawsuits challenging the 2020 election results, got involved, encouraging his followers to do the same.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood also shared a video of himself calling the hospital and warning that the staff would be “guilty of murder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> The <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/amita-hospital-targeted-with-hundreds-of-emails-calls-after-denying-patient-controversial-drug/2607957/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital reported hundreds of emails and calls</a> “associated with one patient’s care,” and there was <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/9/7/22661430/chicago-coronavirus-qanon-supporters-protest-amita-resurrection-hospital-ivermectin-patient" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even an in-person protest</a>.

<p data-paragraph="main">Along with demands and protests over ivermectin, there have been multiple cases of individuals suing hospitals to force them to treat a COVID-19 patient with the drug. In more than one case, these lawsuits have been successful. A <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-elmhurst-hospital-covid-ivermectin-lawsuit-20210503-odktw5zntnarhnyvdemjbr2xfy-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judge in Illinois</a> (separate from the Wilson case) ordered a hospital to allow a patient with COVID-19 to receive ivermectin after her daughter sued for the treatment. In at least two cases in New York, <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/2nd-wny-hospital-ordered-to-treat-covid-19-patient-with-experimental-drug/article_f32339f0-5d01-11eb-b752-4f8966804581.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judges made similar orders</a>. In Ohio, <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/08/30/judge-orders-cinci-hospital-to-treat-covid-19-patient-with-ivermectin-despite-cdc-warnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a judge ordered a hospital to administer</a> ivermectin to a patient with COVID-19 after his wife sued, but then a different judge <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/09/06/judge-reverses-order-forcing-hospital-to-give-ivermectin-to-covid-19-patient/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned that order.</a> Similar cases have been brought forward in <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/09/22/california-woman-wants-hospital-ordered-to-give-ivermectin-to-her-husband-a-covid-19-patient/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a>, <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/kentucky-hospital-doesn-t-have-to-give-patient-ivermectin-judge-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky</a>, <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/article_6fe39414-05ed-11ec-b7da-db4559be0604.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana</a>, <a href="https://www.wdel.com/news/lawsuit-seeks-to-force-christianacare-to-administer-ivermectin-to-man-dying-of-covid/article_bb8fc6a8-1a29-11ec-a45a-3f37133b6501.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delaware</a> and <a href="https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/74-year-old-covid-patients-family-says-hospital-refused-court-order-to-give-ivermectin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas</a>. (Many of these cases have even been brought forward by the same lawyer, as first <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lawyer-ralph-lorigo-forces-ivermectin-on-hospitals-as-covid-treatment-and-drives-doctors-crazy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by the Daily Beast</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fixation on ivermectin is largely driven by online misinformation and a misrepresentation of what we know about the drug. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic that has been around for decades and is very effective at treating certain <em>parasitic</em> infections, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/onchocerciasis/treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like river blindness</a>. Its effectiveness on viral infections, particularly COVID-19, is still being investigated. Unfortunately, there’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-to-stop-hoping-for-a-covid-19-miracle-cure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not yet good evidence showing it’s effective</a> in this case, and one of the biggest papers suggesting it could be effective <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/16/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was withdrawn due to ethical conflicts</a>. That said, it’s not as if ivermectin has been written off; clinical trials to test ivermectin’s effectiveness against COVID-19 are ongoing, and their results will be carefully monitored by federal agencies and professional groups that help create guidelines for treatment. That same process has led to other existing drugs, like <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fdas-approval-veklury-remdesivir-treatment-covid-19-science-safety-and-effectiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the antiviral remdesivir</a>, getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treating COVID-19. But neither the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDA</a> nor the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-advises-that-ivermectin-only-be-used-to-treat-covid-19-within-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a> nor the <a href="https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Institutes of Health</a> currently approve of ivermectin for treating COVID-19. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But misinformation has convinced many people that they know more about how to treat COVID-19 than the medical establishment and experts. The thing is, they don’t. “The number of studies and the quality of them and the different research methodologies in any field of medicine is always pretty overwhelming. That’s why we have professional societies and regulatory bodies who take all of that evidence into consideration,” said Carolyn Bramante, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota and the principal investigator on an <a href="https://covidout.umn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing randomized clinical trial of ivermectin</a> and other potential COVID-19 treatments. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It can, of course, be a good thing for <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/how-to-advocate-for-yourself-as-a-pregnant-black-woman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patients to advocate for their own care</a>. The difference in ivermectin cases is that their advocacy is based on rumors and lies, not on scientific evidence. Though ivermectin has been around for decades, it’s still a drug and it can have side effects and potentially negative impacts, Bramante said. Not only is there not yet evidence that it works, we also don’t know if it could be harmful. That can also cause complications for a hospital system already stretched thin by the pandemic it’s trying to treat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You don’t get treated based upon what you feel or think,” Hood said. “There are certain approved treatment regimens for certain diseases. If [what a patient is demanding] doesn’t fit within that regimen, then you cannot treat them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Online, however, proponents of ivermectin <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tout it as both a prophylaxis and a cure</a> for COVID-19, cherry-picking data from preprint studies and sharing anecdotes of miraculous recoveries. It’s an infectious narrative that leads many people to believe the drug ought to be used widely — and to wonder if the fact that it isn’t is evidence of a conspiracy. Amid the desperate haze of the pandemic, this type of thinking is leading people to extreme actions. All this while another preventive medical intervention, one that has been shown to be highly effective and safe — the vaccine — is shunned by many of the same people. These lawsuits may represent a precedent of conspiracy-theory-influenced patients using the courts as a cudgel to force medical professionals to practice against their own expertise. Right now, it’s ivermectin, but what’s stopping patients from demanding to be treated with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/does-colloidal-silver-work-covid-19/613177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colloidal silver</a> or <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/05/cdc-misusing-bleach-try-kill-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bleach</a>?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Congress is in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democratic-priorities-will-make-it-through-congress-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-on chaos mode right now</a>, with the future of infrastructure, government funding, the debt limit and voting rights all uncertain. But at the heart of the chaos is a core disagreement over a basic tenet of governing: Is bipartisanship still possible?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joe-manchin-filibuster-vote/2021/04/07/cdbd53c6-97da-11eb-a6d0-13d207aadb78_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sens. Joe Manchin</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/21/kyrsten-sinema-filibuster-for-the-people-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyrsten Sinema</a> certainly both think it is. They are so strong in their commitment to working across party lines that they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/filibuster-vote-count/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand alone</a> among Democratic senators in objecting to changing the filibuster. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But they are lone voices for a reason: The political environment most senators inhabit makes public bipartisanship anywhere from difficult to politically suicidal. This is for a variety of reasons, including that so much of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our politics is now nationalized</a>, that party leaders keep most potential “bipartisan” bills from reaching the floor and, perhaps most importantly, that the national parties are now geographically isolated, meaning there’s minimal overlap in the interests and values the parties represent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is, of course, not limited to the Senate, but for the purposes of this article, I’m focusing primarily on how bipartisanship has largely disappeared from the Senate, as that’s historically where more bipartisanship has taken place.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">To understand why a senator like Manchin is such a strong and singular proponent of bipartisanship, it helps to understand just how rare a senator like him is. He is one of just six senators who represent a state that voted for the other party in the most recent presidential election — and one of just two senators whose state voted for the other<em> </em>party’s presidential nominee by at least 10 points in 2020.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six senators are: Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Ron Johnson and Pat Toomey; and Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin, Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester. And Tester is the senator other than Manchin to represent a state that voted for the other party’s presidential nominee by at least 10 points in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

Between 1960 and 1990, roughly half of all sitting senators fit into this group. But over the last three decades, that number has plummeted, as the chart above shows.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, in an earlier political era, many senators shared their state with a senator from the opposite party. Not only did this serve to reinforce the electoral reality that either party could win a state, but it also gave such senators an obvious bipartisan partner in the Senate, particularly on issues of concern to their home state. Today, though, only 12 senators — the six senators mentioned above, plus the fellow senator in their state<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you count Sen. Angus King as a Democrat. King, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, is one of two independent senators in Congress who caucus with the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> — have a colleague who’s from the other party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">So, what changed? Well, pretty much the entire nature of American electoral party politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One way to clearly see this change is to map American partisan competition. From the 1960s through the early 2000s, both Democrats and Republicans were genuinely national parties in the Senate. That is, Senate Democrats and Republicans used to hail from all parts of the country. </p>

Moreover, because Senate elections were more about local issues, both parties were able to compete nationally. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629805000260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voters didn’t care as much</a> whether they sent a Democrat or a Republican to Washington. What mattered was whether they sent somebody who could represent their state well. And senators could prove their worth by <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674493285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing home federal funding for roads and bridges</a> — just the kind of issue that used to facilitate bipartisan dealmaking.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But today’s political campaigns and voters care far less about roads and bridges. They care far more about national culture-war issues — <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo27596045.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and which party controls the majority in Congress</a>. As a result, Democrats can’t win in much of the Southeast and the Mountain West, and Republicans are now perpetual losers in the West and the Northeast. Only the Southwest and the Midwest remain competitive, and that’s only because state populations are currently balanced between liberal cities and conservative exurbs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also why bipartisanship in the Senate is waning. Republican senators in solidly Republican states do not have to worry about winning over <em>some</em> Democrats; the senators’ general election win is all but assured. Rather, the most likely way they could lose is if they face a primary challenge to their right. And the most likely way they could draw such a challenger is if they were to publicly work with Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, a bipartisan record has become a liability in today’s electoral environment.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Even in competitive states, a bipartisan record is no guarantee of electoral success. Take former Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado. His attempt to <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/news/gardner-again-rated-among-the-u-s-senates-most-bipartisan-members/article_44220102-58d4-11ea-ba49-4f3fb74eab48.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prove his bipartisan bona fides</a> in his reelection bid in 2020 ultimately proved no match for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a state that is continuing to trend blue</a>. And we saw the same fate recently befall three Democratic senators of increasingly red states: Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill. All were sunk in 2018 by the “D” attached to their name. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Swing states (and swing districts) also <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/geography-uncertainty-and-polarization/4BF8B48947D113D85662123D207D3418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t have more swing voters than anywhere else</a>; in fact, they might have fewer, since many swing states are only swingy because their populations are evenly balanced between very liberal cities and very conservative exurbs. Consider Georgia: Despite <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/georgia-senate-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a closely contested runoff</a> for both of the state’s Senate races, none of the candidates really tried to run to the middle. It’s a similar story in Wisconsin. It’s <a href="https://www.wuwm.com/2021-08-30/sen-ron-johnson-sounds-like-a-2022-candidate-but-says-he-isnt-one-yet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unclear</a> yet whether Republican Sen. Ron Johnson will run for reelection in 2022, but if he does, he has also chosen to double down on his party’s strategy (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/15/ron-johnson-trump-political-future-445871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embracing former President Trump</a>) versus trying to persuade voters in the middle — even though Wisconsin voted for Biden in 2020 (albeit narrowly). More broadly, the electoral penalty for extremism has <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined considerably in recent years</a>, as the political middle has become a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-moderate-middle-is-a-myth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">muddled vacuum</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even for senators who want to publicly prove their bipartisan bona fides, the problem is that party leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell prefer <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo24732099.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">votes that draw sharp contrasts</a> between the two parties. Divisive partisan politics <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mann-and-Corrad_Party-Polarization-and-Campaign-Finance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help with campaign fundraising</a> in an era of increasingly ideological donors (both big and small). And high-stakes elections <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/10/high-turnout-2020-wasnt-good-american-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobilize and excite voters</a>. Bipartisanship, in contrast, muddles the stakes and blurs the lines. What about infrastructure, you say? After all, that is the one big-ticket issue this year where there has been at least <em>some</em> very public bipartisanship. Is West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, right <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/filibuster-senate-infrastructure-deal_n_61088eeee4b039aafa0e3de1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when she says</a>, “What you see is when we work together and really put the nose to the grindstone, we can get bipartisan support to move forward. That’s what the bipartisan group did, so I think it blunts the argument on the filibuster”?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, if there were ever an issue where Congress should be able to be bipartisan, it would be an issue like infrastructure. In the good old days of bipartisanship, infrastructure would have been an easy bipartisan win; every senator would get some money to spend on their state’s roads and bridges, thus allowing them to tout their home-state spending for their next reelection. Big appropriations bills, stuffed full of earmarks, have long been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/earmarks-biden-infrastructure/2021/03/21/5a9d15ca-88c6-11eb-bfdf-4d36dab83a6d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a path to bipartisan agreement</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet, for four years, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/coronavirus-infrastructure-week-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perpetual</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/trump-infrastructure-week.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joke</a> in Washington was that it was always “<a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/infrastructure-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infrastructure week</a>.” Certainly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/infrastructure-bill-passes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden worked harder</a> than Trump to foster a bipartisan deal. But <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/08/bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-win-biden-senate-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguably</a>, it was the Democrats’ threat of eliminating the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation that pushed McConnell into supporting a bipartisan agreement in a way that bolstered Sinema and Manchin’s faith in bipartisanship. This is hardly a sustainable formula for bipartisan dealmaking on major issues.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Congress can still accomplish some lower-profile bipartisan lawmaking (like a <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/senate-adopts-drinking-water-and-3848959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent major upgrade</a> of our drinking-water and wastewater systems) through what Matthew Yglesias and Simon Bazelon have dubbed “<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-rise-and-importance-of-secret" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret Congress</a>.” It turns out that members of Congress can still work across party lines when issues are relatively noncontroversial and there is not much media attention.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, if you look beyond the partisan media’s name-calling, you can find surprising amounts of bipartisan activity, as political scientist Laurel Harbridge-Yong showed in her 2015 book “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/is-bipartisanship-dead/38C076985676827938D3FD9731D0D28A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is Bipartisanship Dead?</a>” The same is true in a <a href="https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/working-papers/2021/wp-21-08.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more recent working paper</a> by Harbridge-Yong and fellow political scientists Craig Volden and Alan Wiseman. They found that lawmakers who cosponsor more bipartisan bills are more effective in passing legislation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But “Secret Congress” works only because it’s secret, and it’s secret only because the issues are not high-profile enough to draw the public spotlight. But if the only bipartisanship that happens in Congress happens on uncontroversial one-off issues, this leaves the most important issues of the day to wither on the shoals of a 60-vote threshold in the Senate or, more commonly, in the gridlock of a divided government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, most Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-sad-about-politics-who-could-blame-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are sick of all the partisan fighting in Washington</a>. They are, in one widely cited phrasing, part of <a href="https://hiddentribes.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “exhausted majority”</a> — i.e., the two-thirds of Americans who are “fed up with the polarization plaguing American government and society.” Most Americans also say they want <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-americans-really-care-about-bipartisanship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compromise and bipartisanship</a>, though that desire for compromise is conditional — most Americans still prefer that their party win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X18799273" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisans are the most hostile to compromise</a> — especially those individuals whose racial, religious and cultural identities line up most strongly with one party. But the partisan sorting that has aligned these identities so closely with one party over the last several decades is precisely the reason why voters have come down so hard on politicians who compromise. The more that national political conflict is centered on abstract moral issues and the identity of the nation, the more any compromise feels like a surrender.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To recreate the conditions that allowed bipartisanship to flourish in the Senate once upon a time seems unlikely anytime soon. Instead, the most bipartisan-oriented senators are the most endangered. Manchin is a dying breed. His eventual replacement in West Virginia will almost certainly be a Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There may also be moments when the incentives align to navigate an occasional bipartisan deal that can get 60 votes in the Senate, especially on issues that are less covered and therefore lower-profile. But more likely is that the rewards for demonstrating party loyalty will remain stronger than the rewards for trying to be bipartisan, and that the disagreements dividing Republicans and Democrats will stay centered on issues like immigration, democracy and racial justice, where compromise is all but impossible in a binary politics system defined by these conflicts. Certainly, a few senators may still value bipartisanship for intrinsic reasons. But when almost all the structural political pressures are stacked against bipartisanship, American politics — and especially the Senate — will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remain stuck</a> for the foreseeable future.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">It might be an off-year election cycle in the U.S., but September has been full of high-profile elections. First we had the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California recall election</a>, then <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-things-to-watch-in-canadas-big-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada’s parliamentary election</a> this past Monday. And on Sunday, Germany will go to the polls to decide the makeup of its parliament’s lower chamber, the Bundestag. Those results will determine who leads Germany’s government, and importantly, that individual won’t be long-time Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is stepping down after nearly 16 years in charge.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race to replace Merkel <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-why-many-voters-are-still-undecided/a-59251080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be very uncertain</a>, too, because <a href="https://zweitstimme.org/en/posts/forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no one party looks likely</a> to win a large plurality of seats, much less a majority. That means the next government, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/a-history-of-germanys-coalition-governments/g-41818483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like every one in Germany since World War II</a>, will likely be a coalition of at least two parties — and quite possibly a third. And while the leader of the party that wins the most seats often ends up as chancellor, that’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/10/06/schmidt-is-big-victor-in-balloting/939e74c6-f180-47d4-a8d5-d2a969850ab7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not always the case</a>. In all likelihood, though, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56821462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next chancellor</a> will come from <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/cdu-csu-spd-afd-fdp-left-greens/a-38085900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Germany’s two major parties</a>: either the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) helmed by Olaf Scholz, or Merkel’s party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), now led by Armin Laschet. However, there is a small chance that Annalena Baerbock of The Greens, a left-leaning, environmentally conscious party, could also lead the next government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most <a href="https://pollytix.eu/pollytix-german-election-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling averages</a> show <a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2021-08/sonntagsfrage-bundestagswahl-2021-bundeskanzler-koalition-umfragen?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tight race</a> with a <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly fragmented vote</a> across <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany’s seven notable parties</a>. The SPD has been on the rise since late July and now leads in the polls with just around 25 percent, thanks in part to Scholz’s status as the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aT2f8yc8p9-XjOqFCTQ1nDeP5GEORu9QZDOtUwF8smI/edit#gid=1579897364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular choice</a> among German voters to be the next chancellor. Next up is the CDU and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU),<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/where-do-they-stand-a-quick-guide-to-germany-s-political-parties-a-651388.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The CSU&lt;/a&gt; operates only in the state of Bavaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>23</sup></a> which together have seen their polling numbers fall into the low 20s as Laschet has <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/conservative-laschet-struggles-momentum-german-121328724.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received negative reviews</a> for his performance in debates and on the campaign trail. The Greens, who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/germanys-greens-were-riding-high-in-the-polls-but-fell-from-grace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held a small lead in the polls back in the spring</a>, are now at around 15 percent. Three other parties are polling above the 5 percent threshold necessary to make it into the Bundestag (more on that cut-off later), although only two are potential coalition partners: The <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/classical_liberalism.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classically liberal</a> Free Democratic Party (FDP) is polling at about 11 percent, while the left-wing and aptly named The Left Party is polling at about 6 percent. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-far-right-afd-alternative-for-germany-2021-election-results/a-57054532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The far-right and xenophobic</a> Alternative for Germany (AfD) is actually polling higher than The Left at around 11 percent, but Germany’s other parties <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-real-choice-on-election-day-jamaica-kenya-or-mickey-mouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have ruled out</a> forming <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cordon_sanitaire_(politics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a governing coalition with the AfD</a> because of its extreme views.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/spot-gerrymandering-state-fivethirtyeight-80189920</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Yet there’s reason to be a tad worried about the state of the polls in Germany. The Washington Post’s Lenny Bronner <a href="https://twitter.com/lennybronner/status/1438940392758652932?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently found</a> there’s a strong likelihood pollsters are “herding,” which is the tendency for pollsters to produce results that are too similar to one another. Bronner noticed that the shares the SPD and AfD have received in polls are <em>very</em> consistent across pollsters — in fact, in all likelihood <em>too</em> consistent. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-some-pollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we’ve found at FiveThirtyEight</a>, herding can be especially common at the end of the campaign, perhaps because pollsters are afraid of producing outliers that go against the rest of the field. But the unfortunate upshot is that herding often leads pollsters to underestimate some parties’ support and, in turn, leads election forecasters to underestimate the uncertainty in the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even with this concern, however, there is clearly no party flying high in the polls, which makes it difficult to say with any certainty what the eventual governing coalition will look like in Germany. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/jamaica-traffic-lights-or-kiwis-germanys-coalition-conundrum-2021-09-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germans like to name potential governing coalitions</a> after things that <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2021-governing-coalition-options/g-59031537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match the colors of their respective parties</a>, so bearing that in mind, the two most likely coalitions at this point are probably a left-leaning “traffic light” government formed by the SPD (which uses red as its color), the FDP (yellow) and The Greens (no explanation needed), or a right-leaning “Jamaica” government formed by the CDU/CSU (black), the FDP and the Greens. However, each of those coalitions would include a party that doesn’t comfortably align ideologically — the FDP in the former, The Greens in the latter — which could complicate coalition negotiations. In 2017, for instance, efforts to put together a “Jamaica” coalition <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-preliminary-coalition-talks-collapse-after-fdp-walks-out/a-41445987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell apart</a>. And while the business-friendly FDP could join a “traffic light” coalition, FDP leader Christian Lindner has said he wants <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/23/germany-election-chancellor-laschet-scholz-lindner-global-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control over the finance ministry</a> in exchange for helping Scholz become chancellor, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/we-want-increase-investment-germany-fdp-leader-says-2021-09-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be a hurdle</a> for the SPD and The Greens since having the FDP in that position could limit how much they can <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-19/germany-s-scholz-lays-down-rules-for-any-future-coalition-ally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise taxes</a> and expand deficit spending.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why other coalition options could come into play, including an “R2G” (red, red, green) coalition made up of the SPD, The Left and The Greens. In the final days of the campaign, Merkel <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-election-2021-red-scare-angela-merkel-cdu-armin-laschet-spd-olaf-scholz-greens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has voiced fears about the possibility of a left-wing government</a>, arguing it would turn the country away from the moderate course she’s pursued over the past decade and a half. And The Left does have some views that could make an all-left coalition untenable, including a <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-left-party-plans-to-scrap-nato-end-troop-deployments/a-57973017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desire to leave NATO</a> and a lingering connection to old Communist East Germany. Some additional coalitions include a “Germany” coalition of the CDU/CSU, SPD and FDP or a larger “Kenya” coalition of the CDU/CSU, SPD and The Greens. There could even be a renewal of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-election/german-spd-aims-for-post-merkel-government-without-her-conservatives-idUSKBN2B70WV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current “grand coalition” government of the CDU/CSU and SPD</a>, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But OK, that’s <em>a lot</em> of potential coalitions. Let’s talk about how the German electoral system works — as that’s why so many different coalitions are possible. Elections for the Bundestag <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/48997/1/311685250.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combine the principles</a> of proportional and district-level representation, so <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/parliament/elections/arithmetic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germans actually cast two votes</a> at the ballot box: one for a local candidate and one for a party, which allows voters to potentially split their ticket between parties. The first vote functions similarly to most elections in the U.S.: The candidate with the most votes in each of Germany’s 299 single-member districts wins the seat. But the second vote is more important, as it determines the proportional share of seats each party will have in the Bundestag once all is said and done. The 299 district-level members are joined <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/23/how-do-germanys-elections-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by at least another 299 members elected from a ranked list of candidates</a> submitted by each party ahead of the election, with each party gaining whatever number of candidates from the party list it needs to reach its proportional share of seats based on the second vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as mentioned earlier, a party must win at least 5 percent of the party-preference vote, or win at least three single-member districts, to gain proportional representation in the Bundestag.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, a party can win one or two single-member seats to make it into parliament, but it would not be eligible to gain proportional representation based on its party-preference vote share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> However, there is one last wrinkle in Germany’s electoral system: It is possible for a party to win more single-members seats than it is entitled to based on its party-preference vote. When this happens, the Bundestag expands beyond its 598 seats by adding even more members from party lists to ensure each party’s seat total aligns with its party-preference vote share. After the 2017 election, for instance, the Bundestag ended up with 709 total seats, 111 more than its base number, and some projections suggest the Bundestag <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-real-choice-on-election-day-jamaica-kenya-or-mickey-mouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be even larger after the 2021 election</a> to ensure proportionality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into Sunday, it looks like an unpredictable race, with perhaps an even more uncertain coalition-building process to follow. But one thing is certain: This election will mark the end of a distinct era in German and European politics. That’s because Merkel, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/business/merkel-economy-germany-elections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longtime force of stability and leadership</a> in her country, and for the European Union more broadly, is exiting the stage. Merkel, who was sometimes called “<a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/politico50/angela-merkel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leader of the free world</a>” during Donald Trump’s presidency because of his isolationist bent, was the <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/angela-merkel-becomes-chancellor-of-germany" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first woman</a> to serve as Germany’s chancellor, and she <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-angela-merkel-becomes-second-longest-serving-chancellor/a-51773216" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranks high among the country’s longest-serving leaders</a>. Whoever has the job next will have big shoes to fill.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/supreme-court-sets-arguments-big-abortion-case-80131153">announced on Monday</a> that it will hear a case in December concerning a Mississippi abortion law that challenges Roe v. Wade. Mississippi’s 2018 law bans most abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy<em>. </em>This case comes as most Americans (62 percent) want the court to leave the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision<em> </em>as is, per a recent <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_092021/">Monmouth University poll</a>. The Mississippi law isn’t the only high-profile law to challenge the right to abortion, either. Earlier in September, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/">the nation’s most restrictive abortion law</a> went into effect in Texas after the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 vote declining to pause the law while lower courts continue to rule on its constitutionality. Overall, Americans’ disapproval rating of the Supreme Court’s performance (45 percent) is only 3 percentage points higher than approval of the court (42 percent).</li><li>Favorability of the United States has fallen in France after Australia pulled out of a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/19/1038746061/submarine-deal-us-uk-australia-france">$66 billion submarine deal</a>. Australia canceled this contract with France in favor of partnering with the United States and the United Kingdom instead. Upset by this deal, France withdrew its ambassadors from the U.S. and Australia. And, per a recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/20/france-us-favorability-submarine-polling/">Morning Consult poll</a>, favorable views of the U.S. have since slipped in France from 49 percent to 44 percent. However, U.S. popularity among Australians has increased by 2 points with 51 percent of Australians now viewing the U.S. favorably, according to the same poll.</li><li>President Biden announced on Wednesday that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-general-assembly-joe-biden-pandemics-business-united-nations-e7c09c1f896d83c0ed80513082787bd3">the U.S. is doubling its purchase of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines</a> to donate to lower-income countries. Forty-nine percent of Americans say that providing COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries is important (although not a top priority), per a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/09/15/majority-in-u-s-says-public-health-benefits-of-covid-19-restrictions-worth-the-costs-even-as-large-shares-also-see-downsides/#few-americans-know-access-to-vaccines-is-limited-in-developing-countries">Pew Research Center poll</a>. Meanwhile, the Biden administration also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/health/cdc-booster-panel.html">wants to roll out Pfizer booster shots for U.S. adults</a>, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-203d8c288858e815175880753cbc9b8f">only high risk adults and those over 65 receive a third dose</a>. This has been tricky for the Biden administration to navigate as only <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL">32 percent</a> of the world is fully vaccinated, but most vaccinated Americans (62 percent) say they would get a booster shot if recommended, according to Pew.</li><li><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/officials-haitian-migrants-released-us-80163717">Thousands of Haitian migrants</a> are trying to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. Many <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/21/what-led-haitian-nationals-migrating-u-s-southern-border/8419170002/">fled to Central and South America</a> after an earthquake in 2010 and are now leaving due to a lack of jobs, but say they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-mexico-texas-caribbean-immigration-56f1f0093039e2a43e128b7ef0015485">don’t feel safe</a> returning to Haiti. Since that disaster, in 2021 alone, a magnitude <a href="https://apnews.com/article/haiti-earthquake-98f06a322e12f732f94485238d13558c">7.2 earthquake struck the southwestern part of the nation</a>, and the country’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/americas/haiti-explainer-jovenel-moise-assassination-cmd-intl/index.html">president was assassinated</a>. Per a recent <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/52_rate_biden_poor_on_immigration">Rasmussen survey</a>, 52 percent of likely U.S. voters think Biden’s response to immigration issues has been poor. Moreover, a majority of voters across the political spectrum — 84 percent of Republicans, 57 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of voters not affiliated with either party — deemed the current immigration situation at the southern U.S. border a crisis. Many respondents (54 percent) blame Biden administration policies for current immigration problems, while only 37 percent place blame on Trump-era policies.</li><li>On Tuesday, world leaders gathered for the start of the high-level week at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Pressing issues on the agenda included <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-general-assembly-health-china-coronavirus-pandemic-africa-3284c8ff8739dd7cfaf78db214098403">climate change, the pandemic and the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/17/many-people-globally-see-united-nations-in-a-positive-light-including-its-handling-of-climate-change/?utm_content=buffer37fea&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Pew poll</a>, most Americans (59 percent) see the U.N. in a favorable light. Europeans are also largely upbeat on the U.N., with majorities across all nine of the European countries polled feeling favorable toward the organization. Additionally, the U.N.’s response to climate change is mostly favorable around the world. A median of 56 percent of people across the 17 countries surveyed thought the U.N. was doing a good job handling climate change.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, Canadians granted Justin Trudeau a third term as prime minister but did not give his party a majority in Parliament. Germany will have an election on Sunday to determine who will be the next chancellor now that Angela Merkel is stepping down after nearly 16 years in power.
