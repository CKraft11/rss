			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Five states hold primary elections today, but it’s Georgia, with its busy slate of federal and state-level nomination contests, that is most <a href="https://youtu.be/fRgWBN8yt_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on our minds</a>. (You can read <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/11-primaries-to-watch-in-alabama-arkansas-minnesota-and-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our preview of the other four states’ primaries here</a>.) In total, 10 Georgia primaries have grabbed our attention, and in nearly all of them, the key question is once again whether the candidates endorsed by former President Donald Trump, mostly in connection to his false claim that his narrow loss in Georgia’s 2020 presidential vote was fraudulent, will prevail. Trump has become involved in almost two-thirds of the GOP primaries for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state and attorney general, making Georgia his most endorsement-heavy state that’s voting today.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Trump’s sway in Georgia may be limited. He’s endorsed seven non-incumbent Republican candidates across the six offices listed above, and while the five House incumbents he’s backed are likely to win, it’s unclear how many of the others will prove victorious outside of the Senate primary. This isn’t to say Trump’s influence is waning — remember that some of the GOP contenders he didn’t endorse are still pro-Trump — but it’s possible Georgia might be Trump’s most loss-filled state yet, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/politics/trump-endorsement-risk-pennsylvania/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may discourage him</a> from trying to throw his weight around in future primaries.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, 2nd Congressional District, 6th Congressional District, 7th Congressional District, 10th Congressional District, 14th Congressional District, governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>7 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with the primary where one of Trump’s non-incumbent endorsees looks most likely to prevail: Georgia’s GOP primary for <strong>U.S. Senate, </strong>where former University of Georgia football star Herschel Walker looks to be on a glide path to the nomination. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-13-most-important-republican-senate-primaries-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary polling</a> has put him at around 60 percent or better, clearly above the 50 percent threshold of support he will need to avoid a runoff, including a poll released last week by <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/GA-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-May-12-16_release-May-18-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News that found</a> Walker garnering 66 percent of the primary vote. In that survey, his closest competitor was state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, who took just 8 percent. In fact, Black is the only statewide elected official running against Walker, but his campaign never really took off. Walker ultimately consolidated Republican support, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/24/mcconnell-plots-return-to-majority-amid-trumps-influence-513970" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even among some initially skeptical party leaders</a> like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/expect-georgias-anticipated-primary-84922960</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Barring a big surprise, then, Walker will face Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in November. Some Republicans have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-alarms-sound-herschel-walker-georgia-note/story?id=84757313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worried that Walker’s past</a> might make him a weak general election candidate; Walker has faced allegations of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domestic violence</a> and making threats toward women, and he has <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-herschel-walker-confronts-his-mental-health-domestic-violence-allegations-33b96336-77c1-4b3c-915d-896746c52694.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with mental health</a> and faced scrutiny over <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/investigations/herschel-walkers-business-record-reveals-creditor-lawsuits-exaggerated-claims/D3FRT4RA7NFKTN23423ENPUP7A/?link_id=8&amp;can_id=8094ef3ca9e2fe4af466070f61a27eb7&amp;source=email-morning-digest-georgia-republicans-try-to-take-down-herschel-walker-despite-trumps-backing&amp;email_referrer=email_1499145&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-georgia-republicans-try-to-take-down-herschel-walker-despite-trumps-backing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aspects of</a> his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-college-football-entertainment-sports-bb1ef7d866ab99302974cce1816efb65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business record</a>. Notably, too, Warnock has already <a href="http://capitol-beat.org/2022/04/warnock-posts-record-setting-first-quarter-fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achieved a record-setting fundraising haul</a>, meaning the incumbent will have the resources to exploit Walker’s problematic past in attack ads. That said, even if Walker is damaged by these issues, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning electoral environment</a> might be enough to elect him anyway in a state that, despite President Biden’s victory here in 2020, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leans somewhat to the right</a> of the country as a whole.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a different story, though, for Trump’s candidate in Georgia’s Republican primary for <strong>governor.</strong> There, former Republican Sen. David Perdue looks to be headed for defeat. Angry at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/17/politics/kemp-perdue-trump-georgia-governor/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision</a> to sign off on Georgia’s 2020 election results, Trump <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/former-pres-trump-endorses-former-senator-david-perdue-georgia-governors-race/PTKYT6GGQNEBDIWX3NTRF4HJOU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw his weight</a> behind Perdue’s primary challenge. However, things have not played to the former president’s advantage. Namely, Kemp holds a solid lead in the polls: The same Fox News poll we cited earlier found Kemp leading Perdue 60 percent to 28 percent, up from Kemp’s 50-39 advantage in <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/GA-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-March-2-6_release-March-8-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News’s early March poll</a>. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/new-fox-5-poll-kemp-maintains-lead-over-perdue-ahead-of-tuesday-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 5/Insider Advantage survey</a> released on Sunday found Kemp only leading 52 percent to 38 percent, but that result still largely <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2022/governor/ga/georgia_governor_republican_primary-7402.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falls in line with other polling data</a> that suggests Kemp is likely to win renomination without a runoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perdue has also <a href="https://www.wabe.org/georgias-perdue-raises-2-3m-in-gop-primary-but-trails-far-behind-kemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lagged behind</a> Kemp on fundraising, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/brian-kemp-david-perdue-georgia-debate-2020-election-results/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his focus on the 2020 election</a> hasn’t led voters to doubt Kemp’s <a href="https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/politics/georgia-republicans-ready-conservative-legislative-agenda-for-campaign-trail/article_e7c240a6-b03c-52a4-8706-d3ed2fd76df7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative credentials</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=bca047b9-0028-4722-99cf-e8b225416609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls suggest</a> Perdue, who lost a Senate runoff in January 2021, <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/georgia-2022-poll-herschel-walker-leads-senator-warnock-49-to-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be a weaker</a> general election candidate than Kemp against the presumptive Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Stacey Abrams, who is running unopposed in her primary. Kemp <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2018&amp;fips=13&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly defeated</a> Abrams in the 2018 governor’s race, so the expectation of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-gop-could-make-or-break-its-chances-in-10-key-governors-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a competitive 2022 contest</a> could be another consideration for GOP primary voters headed to the polls on Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump likely won’t get his pick for governor, but his endorsed candidates for <strong>secretary of state</strong> and <strong>attorney general </strong>could find more success at the ballot box. And similar to Trump’s vendetta against Kemp, both picks are part of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democracy-is-on-the-ballot-in-these-11-secretary-of-state-and-attorney-general-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a widespread campaign to oust Republican incumbents</a> who defended the legitimacy of the 2020 election and replace them with Trump-backed candidates who would then <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/20/georgia-secretary-of-state-election-trump-00034001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run future elections</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s chief election officer, who <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/weve-found-systemic-fraud-overturn-election-georgia-secretary/story?id=74560956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended the legitimacy</a> of Georgia’s 2020 results and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected Trump’s demands</a> to alter Georgia’s vote tally to put Trump ahead of Biden. This move <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/politics/jody-hice-georgia-elections-secretary-of-state-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned Raffensperger Trump’s enmity</a> and a significant primary challenge from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/us/politics/jody-hice-raffensperger-trump-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-backed</a> Rep. Jody Hice. Speaking to Raffensperger’s vulnerability, <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/1Nu_pYaw5W-OXt24u58OlZP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/21/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hice</a> has outraised <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/1REdNZgHo_WMEPhuy5Ns1JP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/21/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the incumbent</a> $2.2 million to $1.7 million.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Raffensperger still has a fighting chance, in part because he’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/20/brad-raffensperger-stood-up-trump-now-hes-courting-trumps-base/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrayed himself</a> as a strong defender of election security by amplifying his support for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-georgias-new-voting-law-is-such-a-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia’s new law</a> that created <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-annotated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more stringent voting rules</a>. Limited polling over the past month and a half shows a highly uncertain race, too: One survey had <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=eaa28cb5-62e6-438f-a7ed-bbabb6478a06" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raffensperger ahead</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eiVGOGn8Icl5narLdAR-KfuOpLkFSbav/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another had Hice</a>, and two others had the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z8o3QDQ2mqow1YMnaRryq3OXrECD54O6/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two candidates</a> running <a href="https://thestarnewsnetwork.com/2022/05/16/the-star-news-network-kaplan-strategies-poll-trump-endorsed-hice-v-raffensperger-a-dead-heat/?feed_id=2345&amp;_unique_id=628255461d81e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neck and neck</a>. With two other candidates also running, the race could go to a runoff, and the eventual GOP nominee could face a competitive general election against the Democratic nominee — most likely state Rep. Bee Nguyen, <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/05/02/democrats-offer-vision-for-elections-in-secretary-of-state-primary-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has lapped the primary field</a> in fundraising.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Attorney General Chris Carr faces a head-to-head primary challenge from Trump-backed businessman John Gordon. Like Raffensperger, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2022-05-05/more-2020-election-clashes-in-georgia-attorney-general-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carr has defended the integrity</a> of Georgia’s 2020 election result, while Gordon has promised to expose the nonexistent widespread fraud. Just how weak Carr is, though, is tough to say. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible Carr could have an edge, <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/fnDgDkpS7KNfwFh0a_nRIpP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/23/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised nearly twice</a> as much <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/queLTdxdkhxuzcQU-fV-sZP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/23/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Gordon</a>, $2.6 million to $1.5 million, and he’s probably earned some goodwill among conservatives <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-attorney-general-race-features-incumbent-vs-trump-hopeful-in-gop-fight/Q4IDNQFEHBBYDPG73OPX2IG4RI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by launching or joining a number of lawsuits</a> against the Biden administration. However, we don’t have a ton of polls of this race, and the ones we do have <a href="https://twitter.com/HotlineJosh/status/1521470084383920131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show a large share of undecided voters</a>, suggesting it could go either way. The winner here will likely face Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan in November in another potential slugfest.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also near the top of the primary ballot is Georgia’s open-seat race for <strong>lieutenant governor</strong>. Unlike the incumbents running for governor, secretary of state and attorney general, Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/lt-gov-geoff-duncan-a-trump-critic-will-not-run-for-a-second-term-in-2022/C7ANUFARURAEJH5ACDE3L2AD5Y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided not to seek reelection</a> after criticizing Trump and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The GOP primary is now largely a contest between two state senators, Burt Jones and Butch Miller.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump has endorsed Jones, <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/cmCdMRpKd6bm3lIqeCu9QZP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/46/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has raised</a> $4.1 million (including a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/lg-candidate-jones-didnt-report-private-campaign-flights-in-disclosures/WRXXGMJZHNCTDG2ZLHXBKYJGIE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 million loan to himself</a>), and Jones <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2022-05-04/gop-strife-democratic-crowd-in-georgia-lt-governor-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has focused on election-related issues</a>, including calls for an investigation into the 2020 election and the elimination of drop boxes for mail ballots. But Miller has rivaled Jones’s money, <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/YzyW8vtpOQo-EoRL1aeDLy8tDI2u6FmaVm3Ptb7giM01/46/0/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised</a> $3.6 million. He’s also pushed more traditional conversative policy priorities in the state legislature, including a bill <a href="https://thecurrentga.org/2022/04/05/republicans-add-transgender-sports-ban-to-divisive-concepts-bill-pass-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to ban transgender girls from playing high school sports</a> that became law. He may also have gotten a late opening when news broke that Jones <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-georgia-campaigns-government-and-politics-campaign-contributions-5bab8a2810c1ba96fbb9b31cd2040def" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hadn’t been disclosing the use</a> of his family’s private plane in campaign finance filings. But like some of the other down-ballot statewide races, there are a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eiVGOGn8Icl5narLdAR-KfuOpLkFSbav/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ton of undecided voters in the polls</a>, so it’s hard to say how this race plays out. Democrats hope to make a play for this office, too, although they have a very crowded primary field, so a runoff seems likely to decide their nominee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turning to competitive primaries under Georgia’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new House map</a>, Trump has weighed in on two open-seat contests in safely Republican districts. Former state ethics commission chair Jake Evans, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/trump-picks-a-side-in-georgias-6th-district-race/EKFJVQQ2NJEOHKARE2NV7UR2HQ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s pick</a> in the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/election-2022-complete-guide-to-georgias-6th-congressional-district-race/HVEWZKGESNFQBGTEAYXYCJDBEE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redrawn and now-much redder</a> <strong>6th District</strong>, may have a good shot at winning, too. Evans probably attracted Trump’s support thanks to his father Randy Evans, a major Trump donor who served as the U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg under Trump. And helpfully, the younger Evans <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2GA06164/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had raised $1.6 million</a> as of May 4, although nearly half of that was out of his own pocket. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, physician Rich McCormick, who narrowly lost as the GOP nominee for the 7th District in 2020, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0GA07273/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised $2.8 million</a> (including $400,000 in self-funding) in his bid for the nomination. Two days before Trump backed Evans in early May, McCormick’s campaign <a href="https://www.richmccormick.us/poll-dr-rich-mccormick-continues-to-dominate-in-ga-6-leads-by-25-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a poll</a> showing him at 38 percent, far ahead of the rest of the nine-candidate field. But given the crowded primary field, a runoff seems likely, probably between Evans and McCormick, although another contender could also surprise — <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/GA/06/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three others have raised</a> at least $500,000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over in the dark-red <strong>10th District</strong>, which Hice departed to run for secretary of state, former state Rep. Vernon Jones is also testing the power of a Trump endorsement. Jones initially announced <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/vernon-jones-georgia-2022-governor-race-candidate/85-15fab444-fb0b-42d1-b6b9-57352bc589d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bid for governor</a>, but <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/vernon-jones-georgia-2022-governor-race-candidate/85-15fab444-fb0b-42d1-b6b9-57352bc589d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump encouraged him to run here</a> to help Perdue consolidate anti-Kemp support. But Jones, a Black man and former elected Democrat who attracted attention with <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/republicans-kick-off-rnc-with-help-from-georgias-vernon-jones/EQHZJBHF2RGSJEQ5QAJOGZB7IM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his speech backing Trump</a> at the 2020 Republican National Convention, previously represented areas outside this district and is potentially vulnerable as a recent Democratic officeholder.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Jones <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/jones-collins-jockey-for-upper-hand-in-10th-district-gop-debate/54MKEMTAHRF4DM6BXCSMTHZJOE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised more than any of his seven opponents</a> in the first four months of 2022, making him one of the front-runners here. Jones’s chief primary opponent is probably businessman Mike Collins, <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/09/17/mike-collins-launches-10th-congressional-district-bid-in-trumps-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another strongly pro-Trump candidate</a> who lost a primary to Hice in this district in 2014 and whose father Mac Collins <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/C000640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">served in the House</a> for 12 years in the 1990s and early 2000s. We have no recent polling, but a runoff seems possible considering the crowded field.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The one House primary of interest where Trump has backed an incumbent is Georgia’s <strong>14th District</strong>. In that seat, Trump endorsed lightning-rod Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/06/1097232814/marjorie-taylor-greene-can-remain-on-ballot-judge-says-despite-candidacy-challen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to fend off</a> a formal challenge by a group of voters attempting to remove her from the ballot based on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/22/1094273441/marjorie-taylor-greene-is-in-court-as-part-of-a-legal-challenge-to-her-candidacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegations that she helped foment</a> the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of Greene’s primary challengers, health care executive Jennifer Strahan, has attracted <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/01/marjorie-taylor-greene-jennifer-strahan-poll-georgia-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some notoriety and funding from outside groups</a> in her bid to offer the district’s voters a conservative but less controversial alternative to Greene. However, Greene has raised a massive $9.3 million this cycle, so there’s little reason to think that she is vulnerable to a primary challenge. Democrats have a contested primary here, too, with a clear front-runner in U.S. Army veteran Marcus Flowers. But even if he does win the nomination, Flowers stands no chance of defeating Greene in this deep-red district, despite <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-long-shot-candidates-are-raising-more-money-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracting ample attention</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2GA14044/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dizzying amount of money</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The last Republican primary we’ll examine has seen no involvement from Trump, but it’s a race where the eventual GOP nominee could flip a Democratic-held seat. Longtime Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop is defending the light blue <strong>2nd District</strong> in southwest Georgia, and six Republicans are vying for the chance to take him on. We haven’t seen any polling here, but <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/republicans-line-up-for-chance-to-flip-georgias-2nd-congressional-district/OXIC3WCV5JF7LB57HN5RVFYHPE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the favorite may be</a> former Army officer Jeremy Hunt, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/GA/02/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has outraised the rest of the field</a> and has endorsements from Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Josh Hawley of Missouri. However, Hunt’s ties to the district are tenuous, as he only registered to vote in the area back in February, so it’s possible real estate agent and Air National Guard officer Chris West or former Trump administration official Wayne Johnson might be able to best him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having looked mostly at GOP contests, we’ll close with the most high-profile Democratic battle today: the party’s primary in the blue <strong>7th District</strong> in suburban Atlanta. This <a href="https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/u-s-reps-carolyn-bourdeaux-lucy-mcbath-exchange-criticisms-over-fundraising-email/article_2569026c-d265-11ec-8e27-938c8e7245fc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly bitter contest</a> features <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-6-house-races-where-incumbents-are-likely-to-face-another-incumbent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the six member-versus-member primaries</a> this cycle, and it’s a showdown between Democratic Reps. Carolyn Bourdeaux and Lucy McBath. Last November, McBath <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/targeted-by-georgia-gop-mcbath-switching-to-safe-democratic-district/OV227QR4VZCLVJNDP4ZBTHT2TY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to run</a> in the 7th after Republican mapmakers transformed her formerly swingy 6th District into a safe GOP seat. On paper, though, Bourdeaux might have an edge because she currently represents 57 percent of the new seat’s population, while McBath only represents 12 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet McBath, who is Black, may be a better fit than Bourdeaux, who is white, for a district with a voting age population that is only 33 percent white. McBath <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/GA/07/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also raised more money</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/mcbath-newman-everytown-2022/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the backing</a> of pro-gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, given McBath first got involved in politics after her son was shot and killed at a gas station. McBath <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=GA07&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also benefited</a> from $5.1 million in spending from outside groups (including $1.9 million from Everytown), while hardly anyone has come in to help Bourdeaux.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bourdeaux arguably has a <a href="https://voteview.com/congress/house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly more liberal voting record</a> than McBath, but that might be overshadowed by Bourdeaux’s effort <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with eight other Democratic House members last year</a> to force a vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill before considering a larger social spending package, a move that drew the ire of progressives. Still, Bourdeaux <a href="https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/colleagues-and-now-rivals-lucy-mcbath-and-carolyn-bourdeaux-spar-ahead-of-georgias-7th-district-primary-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has criticized</a> McBath for abandoning her seat to Republicans without a fight, and with no recent polling, we don’t really know where this race stands. It could even go to a runoff, as state Rep. Donna McLeod is also running and could win just enough votes to keep both candidates under 50 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s influence in GOP primaries will be sharply tested in Georgia, and a host of down-ballot races could prove to be quite competitive.

<p data-paragraph="main">In a primary cycle dominated by endorsements from former President Donald Trump — an action his predecessors generally refrained from — the Georgia primary is one of the biggest tests of Trump’s sway. He has endorsed at least seven non-incumbent Republicans in the state, including a challenger to Gov. Brian Kemp. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew previews Tuesday’s primaries in Georgia as well as the races in Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota and Texas. They also ask whether it’s too early to conclude that the leak of a draft opinion by the U.S. Supreme Court that would overturn Roe has had little impact on the political environment.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday brings the next big batch of primaries, as voters head to the polls in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia — plus we get a little bonus electoral action thanks to several runoffs in Texas and a special election in Minnesota. And thanks to former President Donald Trump’s attempt to dislodge multiple incumbents who refused to overturn the 2020 election, Georgia is the election on everyone’s mind this week, but there are even more races of note in the other four states — 11, to be exact. Here’s the lowdown on each of them.</p>



<h2><strong>Alabama</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, 5th Congressional District, governor, secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When Republican Sen. Richard Shelby announced in February 2021 that <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/02/08/alabama-sen-richard-shelby-announces-he-will-retire-after-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would retire</a>, the odds seemed high that deeply conservative Alabama would replace the results-oriented incumbent with a culture warrior in the mold of Trump. But the state’s GOP primary for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> hasn’t quite shaken out that way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2021/04/07/donald-trump-endorses-mo-brooks-for-u-s-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially endorsed</a> Rep. Mo Brooks, a Trump loyalist who was the first member of Congress who said he would <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2020/12/02/the-gops-electoral-mischief-491033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object to the 2020 election results</a>, and Brooks did indeed <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/adn-poll-brooks-leads-senate-race-but-britt-has-an-opening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead in most polls</a> during <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/plethora-of-polls-show-tightening-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021</a>. But then former Business Council of Alabama President Katie Britt, Shelby’s former chief of staff, jumped into the race with her old boss’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-al-state-wire-alabama-europe-senate-elections-61079f4b48741c2e2b668756f85a8bb5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement</a>, and former Army helicopter pilot Mike Durant, whose <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/14/us/mike-durant-rewind/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1993 capture in Somalia</a> was dramatized by the movie “Black Hawk Down,” poured <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AL00202/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9.5 million</a> into his own campaign. Meanwhile, Brooks’s campaign <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/17/politics/brooks-trump-alabama-senate-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled</a>, and by mid-March, he <a href="https://1819news.com/news/item/poll-reveals-tight-race-for-u-s-senate-03-23-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was trailing</a> both Britt and Durant <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/durant-leads-britt-in-new-senate-poll-brooks-far-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the polls</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mo-brooks-is-disappointing-trump-mulls-pulling-alabama-senate-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump noticed</a>, and on March 23, he <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/03/23/donald-trump-withdraws-endorsement-mo-brooks-alabama-senate/7139178001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrew his endorsement</a> of Brooks. Officially, Trump argued that Brooks had gone “woke” because he had told a crowd at a rally to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9ZxQsggbM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put [the 2020 election] behind you</a>.” But it’s hard to rule out the possibility that Trump just wanted to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid a loss</a> on his personal scorecard. (Consider, for instance, that Trump unendorsed Brooks almost seven months after his comments but only a few weeks after he stopped leading in the polls.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But a funny thing happened after Trump pulled his endorsement: Brooks started rising in the polls again. The Club for Growth, the anti-government-spending organization that has jockeyed with Trump for influence within the party, is <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/candidates/mo-brooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still backing him</a> and has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=ALS2&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $4.4 million</a> on his behalf. Perhaps as a result, Brooks gained 13 percentage points between late March and mid-May, according to <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/alabama-2022-britt-leads-u-s-senate-gop-primary-but-likely-faces-run-off-durant-tries-to-hold-off-brooks-for-second-place-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College</a>. And according to an average of the two <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/new-adn-gray-tv-poll-shows-tightening-senate-race-likely-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent polls</a>, Britt currently has 31 percent support, Brooks 27 percent and Durant 25 percent. If, as seems likely, no one receives a majority of the vote, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff election on June 21.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Brooks leaving the House to run for Senate, Republicans will also choose a nominee in his deep-red <strong>5th Congressional District</strong>. Madison County Commission Chairman Dale Strong leads the money race with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AL05102/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $1.1 million</a> raised, but he has <a href="https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2022/02/two-counties-gop-leaders-challenge-dale-strongs-right-to-run-for-congress-on-gop-ballot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come under fire</a> for relocating a local Confederate memorial (Strong says he did so to protect it). The second-biggest fundraiser (with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AL05128/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$552,504</a> raised) is former Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs Casey Wardynski, who has the support of the tea-party group <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/house-freedom-caucus-political-arm-endorses-casey-wardynski-in-al-5-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Fund</a>. None of the other four candidates has raised more than $170,000, but it’s possible this race could go to a runoff too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s also an unexpectedly spirited Republican primary for <strong>governor</strong>, despite the fact that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/28/governor-approval-ratings-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular</a> incumbent Kay Ivey is running for reelection. Last year, there were reports that Trump was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/26/politics/trump-2022-candidates-north-carolina-alabama-georgia/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with Ivey</a> for a state commission’s decision that didn’t let Trump hold a rally aboard an historic battleship in Mobile. Trump’s former ambassador to Slovenia, Lindy Blanchard, even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/02/politics/lynda-blanchard-running-for-governor/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the governor’s race</a> after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-governors-distance-themselves-from-trump-drawing-his-ire-11637357756?AID=11557093&amp;PID=6415797&amp;SID=bi%7C619a6cf22c5ebc3a531046d2%7C16529916813120tdxho4l&amp;subid=Business+Insider&amp;cjevent=42d40d09d7b111ec838ff7a40a82b82c&amp;tier_1=affiliate&amp;tier_2=moa&amp;tier_3=Business+Insider&amp;tier_4=3861930&amp;tier_5=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Frepublican-governors-distance-themselves-from-trump-drawing-his-ire-11637357756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking with Trump</a> about the possibility that he would endorse her. (The endorsement never materialized.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The wealthy Blanchard has donated <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/04/18/gov-kay-ivey-leads-opponents-in-fundraising-in-gubernatorial-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$7.8 million</a> to her own campaign, and businessman Tim James (the son of former Gov. Fob James) has also raised $2.3 million for his <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/01/13/tim-james-begins-third-gubernatorial-run-with-fire-and-brimstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-establishment campaign</a>. But Ivey has raised $6.6 million and has used it to cement her Trumpy credentials, including airing commercials on her support for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xztJw19j-CY&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Lie</a> — the false idea that the 2020 election was fraudulent — and <a href="https://twitter.com/kayiveyforgov/status/1513604794929328134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-immigration ads</a> rooted in the baseless “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which claims that people of color are displacing white people in the U.S. in order to advance a liberal political agenda. The only question at this point seems to be whether Ivey can avoid a runoff: In <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/alabama-2022-britt-leads-u-s-senate-gop-primary-but-likely-faces-run-off-durant-tries-to-hold-off-brooks-for-second-place-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an average</a> of the two <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/poll-shows-ivey-close-to-avoiding-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent polls</a>, she took 47 percent of the vote, while James was back at 17 percent and Blanchard at 12 percent. However, when you consider that 13 percent of voters were still undecided, the numbers should be there to put her over 50 percent in the end.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, with term limits forcing <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/04/alabama-secretary-of-state-john-merrill-admits-affair-wont-run-for-us-senate-theres-no-excuse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incumbent John Merrill</a> to retire, the Republican primary for <strong>secretary of state</strong> will almost certainly decide who administers the 2024 election in this dark-red state. Former state Administrator of Elections Ed Packard, who worked in the secretary of state’s office for more than 24 years, is the only candidate who believes there is <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/02/spotlight-shines-on-alabama-secretary-of-state-race-as-views-over-2020-election-and-trump-loom-large.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence of massive voter fraud</a> in the 2020 election. However, he clocked in at just 2 percent in the <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/alabama-2022-britt-leads-u-s-senate-gop-primary-but-likely-faces-run-off-durant-tries-to-hold-off-brooks-for-second-place-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest poll</a> of the race. Instead, this race looks headed to a runoff between state Auditor Jim Zeigler (20 percent), who has the endorsement of <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/04/21/mypillow-ceo-backs-zeigler-for-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">businessman and Trump ally Mike Lindell</a>, and state Rep. Wes Allen (14 percent), who <a href="https://twitter.com/RepWesAllen/status/1336791872426086403?s=20&amp;t=gy33vMUpIdo2jNAGXdA0UA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> Texas’s lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election. A fourth candidate, business owner Chris Horn, also <a href="https://1819news.com/news/item/i-dare-defend-your-rights-chris-horn-campaigns-for-secretary-of-state-02-06-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believes the election was stolen</a> but is polling at just 4 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8:30 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On paper, Republican Sen. John Boozman shouldn’t be in any danger for reelection; he has already been comfortably elected to the <strong>Senate</strong> twice, and Trump <a href="https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/trump-endorses-2022-re-election-of-u-s-sen-boozman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed his latest campaign</a> early last year. However, multiple primary challengers are accusing the <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/politics/2022/04/24/ads-from-soft-spoken-arkansas-sen-boozman-reflect-gop-fury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mild-mannered incumbent</a> of being <a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2022/04/05/boozman-blasted-for-private-remarks-about-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insufficiently loyal</a> to the former president because he <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/sen-john-boozman-wont-protest-electoral-vote-warns-against-undermining-constitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not support</a> overturning the results of the 2020 election. Former NFL player Jake Bequette has been the loudest of Boozman’s opponents, having raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AR00107/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a>. He’s also procured another <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00790071/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 million</a> in spending from a super PAC funded by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/22/boozman-bequette-republican-donor-arkansas-00027089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billionaire Richard Uihlein</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As such, Boozman hasn’t taken the race for granted, having spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0AR00150/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.9 million</a> from his flush campaign coffers and getting another <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=ARS2&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 million</a> in air cover from outside groups. A <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2022/05/undecided-voters-control-fate-of-runoffs-in-u-s-senate-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talk Business &amp; Politics/Hendrix College poll</a> from early May put Boozman at 45 percent, Bequette at 19 percent and former journalist Jan Morgan at 17 percent. However, Arkansas requires runoffs if no candidate gets a majority of the vote, and a runoff between Boozman and a single Trumpist challenger could get interesting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although it’s not competitive, the Republican primary for <strong>governor</strong> also deserves an honorable mention. With Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson term-limited, major Arkansas politicians like Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge initially threw their hats in the ring, but ultimately, former Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cleared the field with her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-endorses-sanders-in-run-for-arkansas-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old boss’s endorsement</a>. She is now well on her way to becoming the 47th governor of this dark-red state — a job her father, 2016 presidential contender Mike Huckabee, once had.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 15th, 28th and 30th congressional districts; attorney general</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, 9 p.m. Eastern in the western tip</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas already had its primary on March 1, but in the handful of races where none of the candidates reached the majority-vote threshold, runoffs will be held on Tuesday. We won’t be keeping up with every race on Texans’ ballots tomorrow, but there are some big ones to watch. First, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/26/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-2022-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement power</a> will be put to the test in Texas’s Republican primary runoff for <strong>attorney general</strong>, where embattled incumbent Ken Paxton will face off against Land Commissioner George P. Bush. It’s the main test of Trump’s endorsement power on the ballot in Texas tomorrow, and so far, polling suggests that Paxton is well positioned to win. A May poll from <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2022/05/15/texas-gov-greg-abbott-still-leads-beto-orourke-in-governors-race-poll-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dallas Morning News/University of Texas at Tyler</a>, for example, gave the Trump-backed incumbent a 6-point edge over Bush (41 percent to 35 percent). Notably, however, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has stayed on the sidelines for this race, while Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/12/18/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-and-george-p-bush-battle-over-alamo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has publicly clashed with Bush</a> in the past, <a href="https://www.danpatrick.org/patrick-endorses-paxton-for-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Paxton</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bush has repeatedly <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/02/george-p-bush-ken-paxton-texas-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knocked Paxton’s integrity</a>, as the incumbent is embroiled in a number of <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-ag-ken-paxton-accused-breaking-law-yes-again-n1287595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal and personal battles</a>, but it’s possible he won’t be able to overcome <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/12/george-p-bush-ken-paxton-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bush family dynasty</a> — the “Bush” name has been increasingly likened to the more moderate wing of the GOP. Some surveys suggest that might be a tough hurdle for Bush to overcome: A <a href="https://uh.edu/hobby/election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Houston</a> poll <a href="https://uh.edu/hobby/election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that <a href="https://www.txhpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TxHPF-2022gubernatorialelection.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about one-third</a> of likely primary voters would never consider voting for Bush — roughly triple the number who said the same about Paxton. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No Democrat has won a <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2012/sep/26/texas-democrats-have-lost-statewide-elections-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statewide race in Texas since 1994</a>, yet it’s worth keeping an eye on the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/17/texas-democrats-attorney-general-runoff-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive Democratic primary</a> runoff for attorney general taking place on Tuesday between Rochelle Garza, a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer from Brownsville, and Joe Jaworski, the former mayor of Galveston. Polling on the Democratic side has been sparse, but the aforementioned Dallas Morning News/University of Texas at Tyler survey had Garza leading Jaworski for the party’s nomination, 35 percent to 20 percent — although 40 percent of voters were still undecided. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond the marquee attorney general’s race, though, we’ll also be keeping an eye on a handful of congressional races. In and around Dallas, for example, state Rep. Jasmine Crockett is seeking to succeed the retiring U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democrat, in the predominantly Black <strong>30th District</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-30.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after barely missing</a> the majority-vote threshold needed to win outright in March. Crockett, who has Johnson’s backing, will face Jane Hamilton, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/17/jane-hope-hamilton-jasmine-crockett-tx-30-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a longtime congressional staffer and campaign adviser</a>, on Tuesday. What makes this race particularly interesting is that both have <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2022/05/16/jasmine-crockett-jane-hamilton-vying-to-replace-eddie-bernice-johnson-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racked up endorsements from prominent</a> Black leaders in the Dallas area. <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2022/05/16/jasmine-crockett-jane-hamilton-vying-to-replace-eddie-bernice-johnson-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some reports suggest</a> the race is still Crockett’s to lose given that she netted 48.5 percent of the vote in March, but <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/17/jane-hope-hamilton-jasmine-crockett-tx-30-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hamilton has attacked</a> Crockett for things like <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/31/jasmine-crockett-botham-jean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misrepresenting herself</a> as an attorney for Botham Jean, a Dallas man who <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/death-innocent-man-timeline-wrong-apartment-murder-trial/story?id=65938727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was fatally shot by an off-duty police officer in 2018</a>, that could hurt her with voters in the district. Overall, though, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the solidly blue seat</a> is one of the quieter primary congressional runoffs. Federal Election Commission reports show that, since early April 2021, Crockett and Hamilton have raised about <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2TX30178/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$567,000</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00779090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$654,000</a>, respectively.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The congressional race in Texas that’s arguably garnered the most national attention, however, is the rematch between Rep. Henry Cuellar and progressive attorney Jessica Cisneros in Texas’s <strong>28th District</strong>. The Democrats will go head-to-head, again, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-28.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuellar netted only 49 percent</a> of the vote in March, compared with Cisneros’s 47 percent. Cuellar also only <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/04/henry-cuellar-defeats-primary-challenger-120954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly beat Cisneros in 2020</a>. But the incumbent could be in real trouble this year. Just ahead of Texas’s primary, the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fbi-raid-us-rep-henry-cuellars-texas-home-office-said-tied-azerbaijan-rcna13005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBI raided Cuellar’s home</a> and campaign office, though his attorney has since said that Cuellar <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/rep-henry-cuellar-target-doj-investigation-home-office-raided-attorney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not the target of the investigation</a>. Even more damaging for Cuellar, though, is the revelation that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-could-strike-down-roe-v-wade-what-would-that-mean-for-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court might be ready to overturn Roe v. Wade</a>, the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion. Cuellar has a reputation as an anti-abortion Democrat, and Cisneros <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/abortion-may-deciding-factor-texas-cuellar-cisneros-democratic-runoff-1705750" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and progressive allies</a> have sought to highlight that. Cuellar, for his part, has tried to downplay his anti-abortion stances, <a href="https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Supreme-Court-draft-puts-Cuellar-in-hot-seat-over-17151736.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing a statement in May</a> that the leaked Supreme Court decision was not based on precedent and would “further divide the country during these already divisive times.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race in Texas’s 28th District is notable for another reason, too: It’s another example of younger progressives taking on moderate Democrats, who are often backed by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/23/nancy-pelosi-henry-cuellar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very established political players</a>. Unfortunately, there haven’t been any polls fielded here since the March primary, so it’s hard to know who has the advantage, but fundraising suggests that this will be another tight race. Both candidates have high-dollar groups contributing on their behalf — like <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1525258262140047363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMILY’s List</a> for Cisneros and <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1524773901829808128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mainstream Democrats PAC</a> for Cuellar. Meanwhile, <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00371302/1593938//" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-runoff FEC reports</a> for <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00709006/1593946/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both candidates</a> show that each has a little over $1 million cash on hand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the 28th District leans Democratic, there’s also a Republican matchup taking place tomorrow between Cassy Garcia, a former staffer for Sen. Ted Cruz, <a href="https://twitter.com/patricksvitek/status/1470451448601366531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who endorsed her</a>, and Sandra Whitten, the 2020 GOP nominee for the seat. In March, Garcia earned 24 percent of the vote to Whitten’s 18 percent. <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Republicans-Cassy-Garcia-Sandra-Whitten-compete-17173125.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to some reports</a>, though, Garcia, who has the backing of the <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1511065360430157830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP congressional establishment</a>, is considered the favorite heading into Tuesday.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Further east, in the state’s <strong>15th District</strong>, voters are poised to see another timeworn matchup between a progressive and a moderate Democrat. But what makes this seat — currently held by Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/01/texas-rio-grande-valley-congress-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is now running in a neighboring district</a> — arguably carry even higher stakes than the 28th District is that Republicans view it as among the most flippable this fall. Though Biden carried the district in 2020, the once-in-a-decade reapportionment process <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the seat more GOP-friendly</a> and, in turn, provides Republicans with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-congressional-map-could-give-a-huge-boost-to-gop-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ripe pickup opportunity come November</a>. The Democratic candidates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going toe-to-toe</a> on Tuesday are lawyer and Army veteran Ruben Ramirez and activist and small business owner Michelle Vallejo. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the March primary</a>, Ramirez led with 28 percent of the vote, compared with Vallejo’s 20 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More recent FEC reports, however, show that <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00797217/#cash-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vallejo has more cash on hand</a>. And while we also don’t have much polling on this race, <a href="https://314action.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/314-Action-TX-15-Primary-Runoff-Topline-Results-041822.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an April survey</a> conducted by GBAO on behalf of 314 Action, an advocacy group that works to elect STEM professionals to public office <a href="https://314action.org/candidates/ruben-ramirez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and is supporting Ramirez</a>, has Ramirez trailing Vallejo by 12 percentage points (49 percent to 37 percent). Whoever wins tomorrow’s race, though, will face a formidable challenge this fall: Republican Monica De La Cruz, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handily won her primary race in March</a> and already has the support of <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/31/monica-de-la-cruz-henderson-vicente-gonzalez-texas-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress’s GOP establishment</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/17/trump-endorses-monica-delacruz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Minnesota’s primaries are actually on Aug. 9, but we’re getting an appetizer of sorts due to the special election in the state’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong>. After the <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/02/18/minnesota-1st-district-representative-jim-hagedorn-dies-at-age-59" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death of former Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn</a> in February, both parties will choose their nominees to replace him on Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The biggest name in the 10-person Republican field is former Minnesota Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan, who is also Hagedorn’s widow. But both of those connections come with baggage. Carnahan was <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/19/under-fire-minnesota-gop-chair-carnahan-steps-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced to resign</a> as state party chair last year after a top donor with whom she was close was <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/19/minn-gop-officials-meet-amid-clamor-for-party-leaders-ouster" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicted for child sex trafficking</a>. Though she denied knowledge of the crimes, multiple former party employees also took the opportunity to accuse Carnahan of covering up workplace sexual harassment and fostering a hostile work environment. She was also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/embattled-minnesota-gop-chair-resign-79508025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded in December 2020</a> saying of her husband, “I don’t care. Jim, he’s going to die of cancer in two years. So be it.” Since Hagedorn’s death, his family has also <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2022/05/18/jim-hagedorns-family-suing-widow-jennifer-carnahan-for-medical-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued her</a> over what they claim is a failure to repay medical expenses.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Carnahan has raised more money (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MN01264/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$403,765</a>) than any of her opponents, but she’s closely followed by state Rep. Jeremy Munson (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MN01165/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$363,120</a>) and former Department of Agriculture official Brad Finstad (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MN01223/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$244,069</a>). A super PAC affiliated with Sen. Rand Paul has also spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00657866/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a> promoting Munson, who is known for <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/national/2022/05/jeremy-munson-could-be-the-next-republican-congressman-from-minnesotas-1st-district-why-are-so-many-republicans-trying-to-stop-that-from-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his obstructionism in the state legislature</a>. (Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he’s endorsed by anti-establishment Republicans like <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremymunson/status/1517889312016187392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremymunson/status/1505922481776963584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Jim Jordan</a>, as well as tea-party group <a href="https://freedomworksforamerica.org/press-releases/freedomworks-for-america-endorses-jeremy-munson-in-minnesotas-first-congressional-district/?hss_channel=tw-357013583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreedomWorks</a>.) On the opposite end of the spectrum, though, Finstad has benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/special-elections-outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MN01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$915,787</a> from Defending Main Street, a group that works to elect “candidates who are ready to work across the aisle to get things done.” The only polling we’ve seen here is an <a href="https://twitter.com/kirk_bado/status/1516086833557512196?cxt=HHwWiIC9ram8nIoqAAAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal poll</a> from Carnahan’s campaign that gave her the lead, but the poll is more than a month old and didn’t exactly come from an unbiased source in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the Democratic side, former Hormel Foods CEO Jeffrey Ettinger looks likely to emerge as the nominee, having outraised his closest rival <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MN/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$423,338 to $36,305</a>. But he’ll face an uphill climb in the Aug. 9 general election: While this southern Minnesota district elected a Democrat as recently as 2016, it rocketed rightward during the 2010s and now has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> of R+14.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are certain divides in the American electorate that we return to over and over again to explain why people think and vote the way they do. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/young-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/women-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/american-politics-now-has-two-big-racial-divides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education</a> — you know the drill. But other, harder-to-see divisions can be just as important, if not more so. Those hidden divisions aren’t about vital statistics or affiliations. They’re about how people see the world.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take the issue of abortion. It’s been in the headlines ever since <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a leaked Supreme Court opinion</a> suggested that five justices are ready to overturn Roe v. Wade, giving states the power to ban abortion for the first time in about 50 years. Plenty of speculation has focused on how such a ruling <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/05/roe-democrats-midterms-women-voters-metoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would affect female voters</a>, particularly if it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/03/abortion-midterms-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could push more women</a> to vote for Democrats in this year’s midterm elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that framing isn’t the only way to look at the issue. Even though abortion is often <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-and-Legal-Abortion-is-a-Womans-Human-Right.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented as a women’s issue</a>, it’s not a topic with a stark division of opinion <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/235646/men-women-generally-hold-similar-abortion-attitudes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between men and women</a>. If you dig into the polling and research, it becomes clear that the divide is less about people’s individual genders than the way they <em>think</em> about gender. People who believe in traditional gender roles — and perceive that those roles are increasingly being blurred to men’s disadvantage — are much likelier to oppose abortion than people who don’t hold those beliefs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The dividing lines of the abortion debate aren’t just about the morality of terminating a pregnancy. They’re also about views of power. Who has it? Who doesn’t? And who should? And the influence of those beliefs isn’t limited to abortion — it also spills into other culture wars, particularly about whether men face discrimination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whenever abortion is in the news, a lot of discussion inevitably hinges on <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/07/women-abortion-texas-law-top-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how women will respond</a>. Losing access to safe, legal abortion will mean that more women carry unwanted pregnancies. The issue itself is <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2022/0307/Can-you-have-women-s-rights-without-abortion-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often framed</a> in terms of women’s rights and autonomy. The problem is that not all women think about abortion that way. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americas-abortion-quandary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center</a>, men and women in the U.S. have exceedingly similar views about abortion’s legality.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Women and men have very similar views on abortion" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mSRvm/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="322" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The Pew poll did find that more women (40 percent) than men (30 percent) said they’ve thought “a lot” about abortion. But that doesn’t mean women’s views on the issue are more uniform. In fact, some of the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/marjorie-dannenfelser-abortion-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most prominent anti-abortion advocates</a> and <a href="https://www.thelily.com/the-new-face-of-the-antiabortion-movement-is-a-young-mom-of-6-who-listens-to-lizzo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicians</a> are women. One reason is that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1554477X.2015.985151?casa_token=ZXBWGEXXklIAAAAA:BPkFGtRT59VbdfkvyqgtgdnNzm-4Z36Kb4rhhzfuwkbUS-C77m3HQWRFV8Hi3sPgsEFI3C_hIbnT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religion is a good predictor of views on abortion</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/30/why-women-are-more-religious-than-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women tend to be more religious than men</a>. Some people who oppose abortion also see it as a women’s-rights issue but in a different sense of the term — they argue that abortion hurts women. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">People with different views on what's needed for gender equality, it turns out, also tend to think pretty differently about abortion — at least, that’s what <a href="https://twitter.com/teemoneyusa?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tresa Undem</a>, a co-founder of the nonpartisan research firm PerryUndem, has found. <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PerryUndem-Abortion-Public-Opinion-Survey-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a recent survey</a>,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted using YouGov’s online panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> her firm found that 69 percent of voters who want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe agreed with the statement “These days, society seems to punish men just for acting like men,” while a similar share of voters who support Roe (63 percent) disagreed. In <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1647-supermajority-survey-on-women/429aa78e37ebdf2fe686/optimized/full.pdf#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2019 poll</a><a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted using YouGov’s online panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> that PerryUndem ran in partnership with <a href="https://supermajority.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supermajority,</a> a left-leaning advocacy group that focuses on women as a voting bloc, they found that likely voters who oppose abortion rights were much less likely, in general, to believe that the balance of power between men and women is unequal, or that issues like birth control access and women’s political representation affects women’s equality.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Views on gender roles line up with views on abortion" aria-label="Grouped Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qOCJN/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="743" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These findings line up with decades of research suggesting that views of abortion are intimately linked to how people think about motherhood, sex and women’s social roles. In the 1980s, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/21/style/profiling-activists-for-and-against-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sociologist Kristin Luker</a> argued that abortion is such an intractable issue because the people on either side of the debate have fundamentally different ideas about women’s autonomy. According to her, abortion-rights supporters saw <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520055971/abortion-and-the-politics-of-motherhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women’s ability to make decisions</a> about their bodies as fundamental to women’s equality, while anti-abortion advocates believed this focus on autonomy undermines the importance of women’s roles as mothers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That analysis can feel a little stuck in the Reagan era, particularly since <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2014/04/08/chapter-4-public-views-on-staying-at-home-vs-working/#:~:text=Roughly%20two-thirds%20of%20adults,for%20parents%20to%20raise%20children." target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for women working outside the home</a> has grown significantly since the 1980s. <a href="https://triciabruce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tricia Bruce</a>, a sociologist affiliated with the University of Notre Dame’s Center for the Study of Religion and Society who has <a href="https://churchlife-info.nd.edu/en-us/how-americans-understand-abortion-a-comprehensive-interview-study-of-abortion-attitudes-in-the-u.s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researched attitudes toward abortion</a>, said that people who oppose abortion aren’t “necessarily [coming] from a place where women belong in only one sphere, which is motherhood.” But views about power and control are still crucially important, she said. In contrast with a focus on women’s ability to make decisions about their own bodies, anti-abortion advocates see that choice within a broader context where other people have views that matter too. “We hear about women and their spouses, what’s the father’s role,” she said. “The idea is that this is not a decision that women should make in isolation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The divide between people who support traditional gender roles — especially those who think modern society is upsetting the balance of those roles by giving women too much power — and people who disagree with that position is spawning other culture wars. It’s partly why former President Donald Trump’s hypermasculine persona worked so well for him politically, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/opinion/josh-hawley-republican-manliness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why Republican politicians</a> continue to focus on the idea that men face discrimination, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-americans-more-divided-on-metoo-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fueled by a backlash to the #MeToo movement</a> and by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/young-men-college-decline-gender-gap-higher-education/620066/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declining rates of higher education</a> and <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/why-mens-social-circles-are-shrinking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising rates of loneliness</a> among men. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These arguments don’t appeal to all men, of course, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/31/662178315/on-metoo-americans-more-divided-by-party-than-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they do appeal to some women</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those messages tap into anxieties shared by men <em>and</em> women about the waning influence of traditional gender roles — in this case, traditional masculinity. Political scientists have found that when people are thinking about threats to their power and status, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536504218766551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political behavior and attitudes change</a>, making leaning on those anxieties a viable political strategy. For instance, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023117740699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an experimental study conducted in 2016</a>, the authors found that when men’s masculinity was threatened by the prospect of job loss, those men were more likely to say they wanted a masculine president — which, of the two candidates, was Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This also helps explain why there are usually bigger political divides <em>among</em> men and women than <em>between</em> them. For example, studies find that men who adhere to more stringent notions of masculine identity, which is used as a proxy for supporting traditional gender roles, look very different on political issues than men who identify as less masculine, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-so-many-men-stuck-with-trump-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we wrote in 2020</a>. Another way to see these divides is through the lens of partisanship. According to a <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/march-2022-aps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> by the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life, 25 percent of Democratic men and 20 percent of Democratic women agreed with the statement “American society today has become too soft and feminine,” while 78 percent of Republican men and 65 percent of Republican women agreed with it. And just 26 percent of Democratic men and 20 percent of Democratic women agreed with the statement “White men are too often blamed for problems in American society,” compared with 75 percent of Republican men and 60 percent of Republican women. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this complicates the conventional political wisdom about how and why voters will respond to political changes and messaging. It’s a little pointless to ask whether women as a whole would mobilize in response to the Supreme Court overturning Roe, since women hold such wildly different views on abortion. Instead, it’s more telling to examine other facets of people’s identities — like their beliefs about gender roles — that are less visible but more politically powerful.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Abortion is becoming personal for people who see it as a proxy for men, largely white men, taking away power from women,” Undem told us. “It’s not about a procedure. It’s about women’s place in the world.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The past year has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-of-americas-allies-have-their-own-big-elections-on-the-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full of elections</a> for major democracies and allies of the United States, including elections in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-things-to-watch-in-canadas-big-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/after-nearly-16-years-as-germanys-chancellor-angela-merkel-has-no-clear-successor-in-sundays-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59110828" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan</a> during September and October of 2021 and in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/emmanuel-macron-could-lose-frances-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France last month</a>. And <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/10/1091921429/australian-prime-minister-calls-may-21-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on May 21</a>, it will be Australia’s turn to decide its political future — change could be in the air Down Under, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because Saturday’s election for Australia’s House of Representatives could spell an end to almost nine years of rule by the Coalition, a political alliance of conservative-leaning political parties led by the Liberal Party<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think &lt;a href="https://www.liberal.org.au/our-beliefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;classically liberal&lt;/a&gt;, not left-leaning, modern American liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> and its leader, Prime Minister Scott Morrison.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coalition &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_22_-_Political_parties" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has existed in some form&lt;/a&gt; since the 1940s. Along with the Liberal Party, the Coalition includes the rural-focused National Party, the Liberal National Party (the Queensland-only merger of the Liberals and Nationals) and the small Country Liberal Party based in the Northern Territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> The Coalition has won a majority of seats in three consecutive elections — <a href="https://results.aec.gov.au/17496/Website/HousePartyRepresentationLeading-17496.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013</a>, <a href="https://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDefault-20499.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a href="https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HousePartyRepresentationLeading-24310.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a> — but polls now suggest the center-left Australian Labor Party is favored to retake power in Canberra, the Australian capital.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Led by Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, the ALP currently leads the Coalition 53.5 percent to 46.5 percent in two-party preference polling, according to <a href="https://www.pollbludger.net/fed2022/bludgertrack2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Poll Bludger’s average of recent surveys</a> (more on two-party preference in a moment) run by <a href="https://twitter.com/pollbludger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elections analyst William Bowe</a>. That 7 percentage-point advantage is significant because if the election results hew closely to the polls, such a result would amount to a 5-point swing in Labor’s vote share from the 2019 election, which is likely large enough to help the ALP overtake the Coalition’s narrow majority — 76 seats to the ALP’s 69 in the 151-seat chamber.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2019 election, the Coalition won 77 seats to the ALP’s 68. But &lt;a href="https://www.aec.gov.au/electorates/Redistributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;as it does after most elections&lt;/a&gt;, the Australian Electoral Commission &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/australian-federal-election-2022-redistribution-electorate-map-changes/a93d723d-f344-4657-8932-342389bc486f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;redistributed seats&lt;/a&gt; to better ensure population proportionality and a similar number of voters in each seat, eliminating a Coalition-majority seat in Western Australia and creating a Labor-majority seat in Victoria. So for calculation purposes headed into this election, the starting point is 76 Coalition seats and 69 ALP seats, with the remaining six seats won by third parties and independents in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a> Based on an <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2022/guide/calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election swing calculator</a> developed by Antony Green, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s chief elections analyst, a roughly 3-point swing in the ALP’s direction might be enough to give it a majority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But vote swings in Australia don’t always neatly translate into automatic gains and losses because members are elected from individual districts (“electorates” in local parlance). In elections to the House of Representatives, Australia <a href="https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/having-your-say/elections-and-voting/federal-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uses ranked-choice voting</a> to determine winners in each district. This system opens the door to a handful of independent and third-party winners, but most races still end up being narrowed to contests between candidates from the Coalition and the ALP, which is why observers focus heavily on two-party preference polls. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in a story that will sound familiar to the Democrats, the U.S.’s left-leaning party, the ALP is at a slight disadvantage in how its votes translate to seats: Labor may need to win about 52 percent of the two-party preference vote to earn a majority, whereas the Coalition could retain a majority with around 51 percent; meanwhile, a result that falls somewhere between those outcomes could result in a hung parliament where no party has an outright majority. (Australians will also vote for around half of the 76 seats in the Senate, the parliament’s upper house, using a form of proportional representation that gives seats to a wider range of parties. But while the Senate <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl/c08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a fair bit of power</a> in Australia, it’s the House election that will decide which party is in control of the government, including Australia’s prime minister.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But before we go anointing Labor as the winner, the polls <a href="https://theconversation.com/labors-lead-narrows-in-three-new-national-polls-and-seat-polls-galore-183110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have narrowed in the last few days</a>, creating some doubt about the outcome. For instance, a <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/race-tightens-poll-shows-coalition-lifting-support-and-labor-dropping-20220517-p5am44.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Australian pollster Resolve Strategic</a> released on Tuesday gave the ALP a 51 percent to 49 percent advantage, down from 54 percent to 46 percent two weeks earlier. Over a similar period, another Australian pollster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/essential-poll-labor-remains-in-lead-but-race-tightens-after-liberal-party-election-campaign-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential Report found</a> Labor’s edge had narrowed from 4 points to 2 points. And this surely is giving the ALP — <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-19/federal-election-results-how-the-polls-got-it-so-wrong/11128176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and pollsters</a> — a sense of déjà vu: Back in 2019, the ALP <a href="https://www.pollbludger.net/bludgertrack2019/?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went into Election Day</a> with around a 3-point lead in the two-party preference polls, only to see the Coalition retain its majority with a <a href="https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HouseTppByState-24310.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-point victory</a> in the two-party vote that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48305001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrison called</a> a “miracle” win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Morrison <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-pms-ratings-tumble-lowest-levels-nearly-two-years-poll-shows-2022-01-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not an especially popular leader</a>, but he and the Coalition may still benefit from the lukewarm feelings the electorate has toward the opposition leader, Albanese. <a href="https://www.pollbludger.net/fed2022/bludgertrack2022/leaders.htm?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls have consistently found</a> more voters pick Morrison over Albanese when they’re asked who they prefer as the next prime minister. That said, Morrison’s brash reputation has attracted a fair amount of criticism, even prompting Morrison himself to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-morrison-vows-more-empathy-if-re-elected-pm-2022-05-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise to be more empathetic in the future</a>, so it’s possible there’s still some upside for Labor here. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for the issues, Morrison has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-australia-politics-idUKKBN2AQ0IA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received somewhat solid marks</a> for his handling of COVID-19, but that goodwill has receded from many voters’ minds with more expressing <a href="https://csrm.cass.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/docs/2022/5/views_on_policy_and_politics_on_the_eve_of_the_2022_Federal_Election_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concern over</a> things like the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-25/vote-compass-cost-of-living-make-ends-meet-poll-results/101011792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost of living</a>, elderly care and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2022/may/18/how-often-do-voters-top-concerns-feature-at-election-campaign-press-conferences-and-in-the-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a>. The Coalition <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-17/australia-s-ruling-coalition-pledges-improved-budget-in-costings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has campaigned on a promise to pare back the budget</a> in the aftermath of heavy spending amid the COVID-19 pandemic and <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/raising-wages-too-much-too-fast-puts-business-at-risk-coalition-20220519-p5amki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has criticized the ALP</a> for its larger spending plans. But the ALP has <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/federal-election/election-2022-labor-to-spend-74bn-more-than-coalition-budget/news-story/5437de07b2061756b9df15f4f5c50b55" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued that the country needs investments</a> in childcare, education and cleaner energy, while also <a href="https://kalkinemedia.com/news/economy/healthcare-in-australia-insights-into-budget-and-election-promises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shoring up Australia’s universal health care system</a>. Given its proximity and clout, China <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/05/15/australia/australia-election-xi-jinping-china-relations-intl-hnk-dst/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also been top of mind for voters</a>. The Coalition has tried to cast the ALP as soft on China, while the ALP has argued the government’s approach hasn’t worked given China recently signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands, a nearby small island nation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Climate change could have electoral repercussions, too. Despite a spate of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-61432462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural disasters in Australia</a> ranging from massive bushfires to heavy flooding, critics say climate change <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/17/australia-election-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has not received its due</a> in the campaign. A <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/australian-conservative-party-faces-teal-independent-threat-84825594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movement of climate-focused</a> “teal” independent candidates — referencing the color of their campaign materials — are targeting seats controlled by the Coalition. And if these independents are successful at picking off a handful of Coalition-held seats, they could end up controlling the balance of power if the election produces a hung parliament, giving them a chance to push for more climate-friendly policies in exchange for helping one of the major parties govern the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Learning how this will all play out, though, could take a bit of time because, much like in the U.S., <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/18/australian-election-polls-2022-show-race-tightening-in-final-stretch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Aussie voters than ever</a> are voting by mail — “postal voting” in local parlance. Already, around 5.4 million voters <a href="https://www.aec.gov.au/Enrolling_to_vote/Enrolment_stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of about 17.2 million</a> have voted early in-person or by mail, and another 1.2 million mail ballots are still outstanding. Because Australia <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/religion/bonotti-strangio-australian-experience-of-compulsory-voting/13531720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has compulsory voting</a> — those who fail to vote face a fine if they don’t have a good excuse — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/world/australia/compulsory-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we can expect</a> roughly 90 percent of the electorate to cast a ballot, which means that around a third of voters are already using some form of early voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So with all this in mind, make sure to check the Australian election results when you wake up on Saturday — Sydney is 14 hours ahead of eastern time in the U.S. — it’s one of the rare instances where you can watch election night coverage while you enjoy your morning coffee.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Our first FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll on the top issues facing Americans came out earlier this week. We found that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-2000-americans-about-their-biggest-concern-the-resounding-answer-inflation/">Americans are worried about inflation</a> more than any other issue, and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/05/16/consumer-grocery-habits-inflation/">April survey data from Morning Consult</a> shows how this is affecting Americans’ choices at the grocery store. In the poll, 43 percent said they bought generic to save on groceries, up from 36 percent six months prior. In a separate survey, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/05/17/inflation-impacting-consumers-long-term-financial-goals/">Morning Consult also found</a> Americans are growing more concerned about their financial well-being. In April, only 24 percent of Americans said they could handle an unexpected expense completely or very well, down from 29 percent last June, and 26 percent said they felt the same about securing their future financial security, down from 31 percent.</li><li>Feeling tired of politics? You’re not alone. A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/politics/cnn-poll-us-politics-burnout/index.html">new CNN/SSRS survey</a> found just 23 percent of Americans were “fired up” about politics, while 53 percent said they were “burned out.” Moreover, no one really feels like their political party of choice is doing well, as just 9 percent said they felt like they were mostly on the winning side, while 32 percent said their side was losing more than winning. (That said, 58 percent said neither state described how they felt.)</li><li>In the wake of the leak of a draft opinion that could signal the Supreme Court’s intentions to overturn Roe v. Wade, 60 percent of Americans <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/support-abortion-rights-hits-new-high-midterm-outlook-stays-mostly-unc-rcna28869">told NBC News</a> earlier this month that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the highest percentage the poll had found dating back to 2003. By comparison, 32 percent said abortion should be illegal with some exceptions and just 5 percent said it should be illegal in all cases.</li><li><a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3846">Quinnipiac University’s latest poll</a> found 69 percent of Americans support limiting the number of years a justice should serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, where currently justices have lifetime appointments. Remarkably, there is broad bipartisan agreement on this, too, as 77 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of Republicans back some sort of term limit, as did 69 percent of independents.</li><li>Mask-wearing to combat COVID-19 is no longer required on flights, but <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/392597/americans-divided-face-masks-flying.aspx">Gallup found Americans</a> continue to be split on whether the federal government should mandate face coverings in the air. In late April and early May, 49 percent said the government should enforce mask-wearing on flights, while 51 percent disagreed. Unsurprisingly, there were strong partisan divides on this question, as 81 percent of Democrats thought masks should be required, compared with only 13 percent of Republicans. Forty percent of independents also supported a mask mandate on planes.</li><li><a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_051622/">Monmouth University found</a> continued support for U.S. actions against Russia given its invasion of Ukraine. In May, 77 percent of Americans said they supported the economic sanctions that the U.S. has imposed on Russia, which is roughly the same as what Monmouth found in March. And despite concerns about high gas prices, almost 4 in 5 still support the U.S. ban on Russian gas and oil imports, also unchanged from two months earlier. Additionally, 77 percent said they supported sending weapons to Ukraine. However, these views haven’t boosted President Biden’s standing, as only 43 percent approve of Biden’s handling of the Ukraine situation and 50 percent disapprove, down from his 46 percent approve/48 percent disapprove mark in March.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Veronica wasn’t sure how the new disease she’d heard about on the news would affect her. It seemed unreal. She and her friends had just been <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mobile-app-plague-inc-china-tops-app-chart-coronavirus-spreads-1483600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joking about a game on the Google Play Store</a>, in which the goal was to wipe out humanity with a deadly virus. “We joked about it. We were like … this is the apocalypse,” she said. “And then it happened.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Veronica, who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy, is a 39-year-old Latina single mom who works as a part-time teller at a small bank for $15 an hour near a Gulf Coast city in Texas. She said she remembers feeling left out when she saw people take advantage of new opportunities to work from home. “I mean, we couldn’t do that. People wanted their money. They got scared. So we stayed at work. We didn’t have a choice.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In March 2020, when Gov. Greg Abbott <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/DISASTER_covid19_disaster_proclamation_IMAGE_03-13-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared a state of disaster</a>, the bank that Veronica works for emailed new directives to combat the pandemic. They locked their lobby doors, closed the building to visitors, used drive-through banking only and avoided transferring personnel from one branch location to another. The employees like Veronica who had to show up for work were encouraged to disinfect surfaces and wash their hands frequently. Soon, they’d be encouraged to wear masks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I felt safer with the doors closed, but I still didn’t want to come,” she said. Her branch operates with about two to three people in it at any given time, but during the pandemic’s beginning, she felt there were components to the work that some of them could have done from home at least sometimes to minimize their risk of exposure. “But they weren’t really offering anybody remote [work], except upper management,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The doors stayed locked until fall 2020, when patrons could once more enter the lobby for regular banking, as if the pandemic were over. Veronica said people were supposed to wear masks, but the bank didn’t enforce <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/23/peaster-superintendent-texas-mask-mandate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state’s mandate</a>. “And they kind of told us not to make people feel like they had to,” she said. “So we chose our battles.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Veronica lives with her retired mother and eight-year-old son and was worried about bringing COVID-19 home to them. She also smokes and was afraid that the virus could make her very ill. But neither she nor her son became sick. Instead, during the first summer of the pandemic, her mother contracted COVID-19, possibly through a friend, and she was hospitalized the week after July 4. Veronica had only two weeks of paid leave to take care of her hospitalized mom before she had to return to the office. (Veronica says she tested positive after her mother returned from the hospital, then tested positive a second time, during the delta wave, but she said she never had symptoms.) When her mother came home in August, Veronica was left alone to handle child care, taking care of her mother and continuing to report to work. Her son stayed with his father during the week, and Veronica felt awful about it because he’d always been with her.. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trying to balance caring for her mother while her son still had remote and in-person classes was overwhelming. Veronica was also scared her son would bring the virus home, so she decided to withdraw him from school and try homeschooling him, thinking it would be easier to manage. “I didn’t see any other choice at that time, and I’m glad that I did,” she said. “I wouldn’t have made it out.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The weight of the pandemic’s changes and dangers have fallen unevenly on different groups in the United States, but women like Veronica are among those who shouldered the biggest burdens. Inequalities existed before COVID-19, of course, but in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-reminded-us-of-just-how-unequal-america-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many ways they worsened</a> over the past two years. One key division has been how our employers adapted to a deadly, rapidly spreading virus. For many workers, March 2020 marked the dawn of the work-from-home era, a change that seems mostly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2022/02/01/remote-work-is-here-to-stay-and-will-increase-into-2023-experts-say/?sh=3dce36eb20a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here to stay</a>. But that’s not true for everyone.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The changes in remote work launched by the pandemic have been dramatic. The number of hours worked from home skyrocketed in 2020. An April 2021 working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research estimated that telework accounted for only 5 percent of paid work hours before the pandemic, but between April and December 2020, <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28731/w28731.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was about 50 percent</a>. Even now, more than two years after the pandemic began, many workplaces still don’t have their entire staff reporting to an office five days a week, and many are unlikely to do so ever again. According to a working paper from <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/will-it-stay-or-will-it-go-analysing-developments-in-telework-during-covid-19-using-online-job-postings-data_aed3816e-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indeed.com and OECD</a>, the share of job postings on Indeed that mentioned remote work roughly tripled during the pandemic — and was still <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/12/16/will-remote-work-persist-after-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5 percent of job postings in September 2021</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But most Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t have jobs in which telework is an option</a>. There are fields where that’s not surprising: hospital jobs, factory jobs, jobs at grocery stores and retail outlets, jobs delivering food, among numerous others. There are other jobs, too, in which workers might have been able to work from home, but their workplaces lacked the technology or resources.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it is women who are overrepresented in these jobs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In March, the Women &amp; Politics Institute at American University and the Barbara Lee Family Foundation <a href="https://www.genderontheballot.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-New-Normal-3.8.22-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a report</a> showing that 49 percent of women likely to vote in the 2022 election felt burned out since the start of the pandemic. Moreover, among those making less than $50,000 a year, 67 percent said they were not working from home. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1218641861-1024.jpg" alt="Grocery store cashiers wear protective equipment" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1218641861-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1218641861-1024.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1218641861-1024.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>For a lot of Americans, telework hasn’t been an option during the pandemic, and many of those jobs offer low wages. <p>Joe Raedle / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">A recent report by the <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FINAL-GQR-NWLC-survey-slides-3.29.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Women’s Law Center had similar findings</a>. Notably, it found that among adults making less than $15 an hour, which included 48 percent of women and 25 percent of men, women were more likely than men to say they’d lost or quit a job during the pandemic — 41 percent of women, 33 percent of men. Low-paid women were also twice as likely as women overall to have changed jobs during the pandemic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I spoke to 19 women who fell into these categories and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-you-a-woman-who-cant-work-from-home-during-the-pandemic-we-want-to-hear-from-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volunteered to be interviewed</a>. Among them were women who chose to go into their offices because they felt safe with the precautions their companies had put in place, or because they felt it would be too hard to work from home, or because their duties made them key employees for their offices. But many others were required to report to an office if they wanted to keep their jobs. Some women felt that their safety concerns were respected, while others struggled to keep up with the latest public health guidance despite coworkers and bosses who did not. In general, the women whose experiences were better had workplaces that they felt prioritized their safety and were flexible and responsive to their needs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maria Saavedra Karlsson is a pediatrician who’d spent most of her career in children’s hospitals but began working at a nonprofit urgent-care clinic before the pandemic. Because she works with patients, she continued working in person. She told me about the eerie feeling of driving down empty highways that were normally crowded, but she said she knew her patients needed her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the clinic’s clientele were low-income Latino residents of Southern California, where Karlsson lives. She said that a lot of the clinic’s adult patients as well as the parents of their child patients had continued to work through the pandemic, and that case counts at the clinic remained high during almost every wave.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Karlsson said the clinic’s management, who did not work on site, were reluctant to expand telemedicine, which almost all the clinic’s doctors agreed was better for everyone. Patients also preferred telemedicine, Karlsson said. When doctors were sick or in quarantine, they’d see clients remotely via telehealth technology, and the doctors found they could easily see 35 to 40 patients a day, comparable with the amount they could see in person. Patients were also safer in their homes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Karlsson and her colleagues tried to convince the clinic’s management to do more telemedicine. “We tried to take a day off and actually just volunteer to do telehealth and show them how effective that was,” she said. “It didn’t work.” Instead, their patients had to come into the clinic, which she felt was unnecessary exposure for everyone. The stress of it encouraged Karlsson to leave the clinic and work as a telehealth doctor for an online company while she also started her own practice seeing patients in their homes, but she estimated that the move cost her about 75 percent of her income. </p>

That impacts not only their earnings now but also their futures, as many are struggling to build up retirements or recover income lost over the past two years. According to the Women &amp; Politics Institute/Barbara Lee Family Foundation report, 55 percent of female likely voters making less than $50,000 a year said that their personal financial situation was worse now than before the pandemic, including 27 percent who said it was a lot worse.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Others I spoke with were transitioning to new jobs not just because of the stresses of in-person work during a pandemic, but also because they felt a lack of respect from their bosses. Taylor Anne Barriuso is a 29-year-old white woman and an academic advisor at a state college in Iowa, and she said her administration required advisors like her to return to campus in the fall semester of 2020. “There were very few students on campus, and the meetings with students were almost exclusively virtual at that point,” she said, adding that many professors and other higher-up administrators were able to choose whether they worked or taught remotely. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that she had to return to in-person work early isn’t the only reason she plans to leave her job — she also wants to attend graduate school for speech-language pathology — but it was a factor. “It did contribute to kind of an overall feeling of … micromanagement. … There was a kind of general feeling of distrust that we were still doing our jobs from home,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Women with people-facing jobs often found themselves with extra duties. Lindsay Ellis, a 35-year-old Black woman who works as a fitness director at a gym in a city in North Carolina and, like many, was furloughed early in the pandemic. When her gym opened back up in November 2020 and she returned to work, she had to enforce mask mandates that were frequently changing and often challenged by her clients. Ellis quickly became aware of how much sweat and heavy breathing filled the cycling room where she teaches classes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ellis thought she’d survive a COVID-19 infection but was worried about long COVID, which could impact her lung health for months and keep her from working. “I’m surrounded by hundreds of people a day, and members who are supposed to wear masks had quit [wearing them],” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, women staff <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Low-Wage-Jobs-are-Womens-Jobs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of the jobs</a> that typically pay less than $10 an hour. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-women-essential-workers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One in three jobs held by women</a> were deemed essential during the pandemic. And women, no matter their income level, were often left with <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/women-work-and-family-during-covid-19-findings-from-the-kff-womens-health-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest share of caregiving duties</a> — whether it was taking care of elderly parents, children whose schools and daycares were shut down or, in many cases, both.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/upshot/pandemic-working-mothers-jobs.html?te=1&amp;nl=the-upshot&amp;emc=edit_up_20220512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times found in a recent analysis</a>, many mothers have remained in the workforce despite the challenges. There was one exception to this, however: mothers living with children under the age of five. Among them, the share who were in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/upshot/pandemic-working-mothers-jobs.html?te=1&amp;nl=the-upshot&amp;emc=edit_up_20220512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workforce was down 4.2 percent</a> between March 2019 and March 2022, indicating how uneven the burdens of the pandemic have been. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The pandemic has been horrible, but there’s a couple of good things in terms of flexibility and women in the workplace. … [Low-paid women] haven’t been able to take advantage of any of that,” said Betsy Fischer Martin, executive director of the Women &amp; Politics Institute. “They have absorbed all of the regular negativity of the pandemic and had none of the upside to it.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1228421958-711.jpg" alt="A mother works from home while her son attends school remotely" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1228421958-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1228421958-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1228421958-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Many women have remained in or even joined the workforce during the pandemic. But for some, this has also meant balancing work with child care or care for elderly family members. <p>Jayme Gershen / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, those who are still working from home like it. In the beginning of the pandemic, most people who worked from home had to because their offices closed. But now, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a recent study by the Pew Research Center</a>, 76 percent of American workers whose workplace was open and who were mostly or totally working from home said that a major reason they were teleworking was because they preferred it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Women’s financial worries haven’t eased up, either. In the Women &amp; Politics Institute/Barbara Lee Family Foundation report, inflation was an important issue for female likely voters who made less than $50,000 a year. “In many cases, they are the primary earners and their home,” Fischer Martin said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Workers are seeking better circumstances and better pay as well. Ellis, the fitness director, said her workplace was still short-staffed and they’d had trouble hiring more people to fill the positions. Ellis herself is an hourly worker and spent the first part of the pandemic not working, worried that her employer wouldn’t cover her insurance while she wasn’t earning a paycheck. (They covered her.) She said the starting pay for instructors at her facility is $10 an hour.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When the gym reopened in fall 2020, its class offerings were reduced because management couldn’t find enough instructors, and she said it’s gotten even worse as some of the bankers and others who had been working from home for two years have begun to return to their downtown offices. “A lot of my members … want more hours,” she said. “They want more amenities.” They also want to go completely back to the way things were pre-pandemic, she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She tells them she wants to offer them more hours and classes, but that the gym is struggling to hire staff. “And then the response is, ‘Yeah, you know, people just don’t want to work nowadays,’” she said. She suspects they expect her to agree with them, but she doesn’t. “People want to work,” she said. “They just want to get paid fairly for the work.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For others, coming out of the pandemic will remain difficult because many key services haven’t returned to pre-pandemic levels. For example, the availability of child care remains about 12 percent lower than it was before 2020, according to Alycia Hardy, a senior policy analyst with The Center for Law and Social Policy. That reduction in supply can raise the cost of child care, which was already out of reach for many families in lower income brackets. Additionally, child care itself is often <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/child-care-workers-among-the-one-of-the-lowest-paid-occupations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a low-paying profession</a>, so many of the providers may be seeking work elsewhere for the reasons described by Ellis. “We’ve seen this devastation on this already fragile system,” Hardy says. “What that really translates into for families is that half a million families are without child care.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the women I spoke to had changed jobs or were planning to. Others had changed their relationship to work. But many also felt that people in their circumstances needed more support. In the Women &amp; Politics Institute/Barbara Lee Family Foundation report, a strong majority of women likely to vote in the 2022 midterms thought Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act should be expanded. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if Congress’s failure to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congress-found-an-easy-way-to-fix-child-poverty-then-it-walked-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extend the expanded child tax credit</a> — which <a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/montly-poverty-december-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have been keeping 3.7 million children out of poverty</a> — is any indication, we’re unlikely to see broad changes anytime soon.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Veronica, the bank teller, wants to make changes in her own life. Before the pandemic, she began working at the bank part-time so that she could take a course to become a court reporter and move into a better-paying field. But when the course shifted online, she felt she wasn’t able to learn as much as she had in the classroom. The extra burdens of her sick mother and homeschooled son made it untenable to balance her coursework and her job. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She wants to go back, though. She thinks it’s time for a career change. “It feels like I’m fighting for just $15 an hour,” she said. “It doesn’t feel fair, you know, after giving eight years to this place.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She said she thinks there are more people in her position — people who’ve had some college but haven’t finished, who know they have skills but feel they’re undervalued in the workplace and want more flexibility in their jobs. “I feel like a lot of people are in my position,” she said. “They want the same thing. They wanted to feel valued.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Has modern birth control made abortion a thing of the past? That’s what lawyers for the state of Mississippi want the U.S. Supreme Court to think. In a brief in the the pending case that could overturn abortion rights nationwide, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-1392/184703/20210722161332385_19-1392BriefForPetitioners.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi’s lawyers wrote</a>, “[E]ven if abortion may once have been thought critical as an alternative to contraception, changed circumstances undermine that view.” Access to birth control has improved, they noted, and some methods’ failure rates are “now approaching zero.” According to Mississippi’s lawyers, effective birth control means people don’t need abortions anymore.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Sarah, a professional living in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., did.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She asked us to withhold her full name for privacy reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> She had always wanted four children, but four was it. So after her fourth child was born, she and her husband researched birth-control options and landed on the one that seemed foolproof: a vasectomy. “We’re very thorough people, very by the book,” she said. “We wanted to make very, very sure we didn’t have an accident.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then, on Mother’s Day, Sarah found herself in her bathroom looking at two lines on a pregnancy test. She knew almost immediately that she was going to have an abortion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Statistically, Sarah’s experience was very unlikely. There’s a reason why vasectomies are touted as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2721499/#:~:text=Vasectomy%20is%20one%20of%20the,pregnancy%2C%20adequate%20counseling%20is%20essential." target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most reliable forms of birth control</a>: They have <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/4423-vasectomy#:~:text=Vasectomy%20offers%20many%20advantages%20as,procedure%20that%20provides%20permanent%20contraception." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a failure rate</a> of less than 1 percent,<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 0.0001 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> as opposed to something like condoms, which has a failure rate closer to 13 percent. But because a 1 percent chance isn’t zero, some vasectomies fail every year, just like every other form of birth control. As a result, thousands of Americans who took steps to avoid getting pregnant will seek an abortion anyway. A <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2018/about-half-us-abortion-patients-report-using-contraception-month-they-became" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from the Guttmacher Institute</a> found that about half of abortion patients used contraception in the month they became pregnant. Framing abortion as a procedure that can be avoided through personal responsibility doesn’t prevent abortions from happening, experts told us. Instead, it just places more blame on women. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans need better access to contraception. In countries where birth control is cheap or free and more easily available to more people, there are much lower rates of unintended pregnancy, said <a href="https://obgyn.uw.edu/faculty/emily-m-godfrey-md-mph-faafp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Emily Godfrey</a>, a professor of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington. The unintended pregnancy rate in the United States is <a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/3/e007151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 21 percent higher</a> than in the average Western country,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-03-2022-first-ever-country-level-estimates-of-unintended-pregnancy-and-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;World Health Organization and Guttmacher Institute estimate&lt;/a&gt; that modeled average rates between 2015 and 2019 for 150 countries. The WHO paper included the U.S., Canada and 35 European countries in its calculations of the median country rate for Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a> where national insurance or other universal health care programs are common. Likewise, a large <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2016/us-unintended-pregnancy-rate-falls-30-year-low-declines-seen-almost-all-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop in unintended pregnancy rates in the U.S.</a> between 2008 and 2011 was <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2016/03/new-clarity-us-abortion-debate-steep-drop-unintended-pregnancy-driving-recent-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correlated to an increase in the use of long-term, reversible methods of birth control</a>, such as IUDs or implants, which have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/index.htm#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low failure rates</a>. And that large drop in unintended pregnancy rates has led to <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2019/09/us-abortion-rate-continues-drop-once-again-state-abortion-restrictions-are-not-main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer abortions</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s not the same as saying that using birth control eliminates the need for abortion, Godfrey said. Yes, Americans can choose from <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/minimum-contraceptive-coverage-requirements-clarified-by-hhs-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16 forms of birth control,</a> two types of emergency contraception or “morning-after pills,” and three methods of sterilization. But there are many reasons why she says access to abortion remains necessary. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The simplest and most inescapable reason is that birth control can — and does — fail. That’s true even of the most reliable methods of preventing pregnancy, such as IUDs, implants and sterilization. </p>

<p>Source: Guttmacher Institute</p>
</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">According to the Guttmacher Institute study cited in the chart above, about 51 percent of <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(18)30003-9/fulltext#secst0060" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion patients in 2014 reported using some type of birth control</a> in the month they got pregnant. The shares of patients in that study who reported using a long-lasting, high-efficacy birth-control method were low — far more respondents said they had used a condom in the month they got pregnant, which doesn’t necessarily mean, of course, that they were using one at the time they got pregnant. But small percentages still represent thousands of individuals. Just 0.8 percent of respondents said they’d been using an IUD in the month they got pregnant, but that 0.8 percent translated to an estimated 7,700 abortion patients that year. Even the 0.2 percent who said they’d used either sterilization or implants represented an estimated 1,600 and 1,800 people, respectively, who ended up needing access to abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the political rhetoric of abortion doesn’t reckon with that fact, said <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/christine.dehlendorf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Christine Dehlendorf</a>, a professor of family community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “The mantra of ‘safe, legal and rare’ is stigmatizing,” she said. “It’s saying [abortion is] a bad outcome you should be able to avoid, as opposed to a health care service you should be able to access.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as a result, people are getting the message that abortion is a purely preventable problem — something a person can avoid <em>if</em> they are responsible enough. Sarah’s story comes from a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-you-have-an-abortion-story-we-want-to-hear-from-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collection of experiences with abortion</a> that readers shared with FiveThirtyEight. Our database contains hundreds of entries, and a common, recurring theme is that people reported getting pregnant while using birth control — and then felt like <em>they</em> were the ones who had failed. Contributors said they had done everything right, yet they still felt responsible. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">User error does contribute to unintended pregnancy, Godfrey said. That’s especially relevant when you’re talking about methods like the birth-control pill, which has to be taken correctly every day, or physical methods like condoms, which rely on proper usage in the moment. But user error can’t be dismissed as sexual irresponsibility either, she added. It’s just normal human behavior. “There’s research showing, on average, people miss a pill or two each month. That’s <a href="https://www.nehi-us.org/writable/publication_files/file/pa_issue_brief_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not just birth control</a>, it’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068890/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all long-term pills</a> … depression, diabetes, everyone,” she said. “Nobody uses any medication perfectly for 25 years. It’s not possible.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over and over, contributors described struggling with the feeling that abortion should be something they needed only if they were victimized, young and uninformed, too poor to get birth control, or just too irresponsible to take it properly. The stigma wrapped up in that stereotype made Sarah feel uneasy about her decision, even though she knew it was the right choice for her. “Society tells you to feel bad, so therefore I felt bad,” she said. “But, ultimately, I realized that if you can’t control when you have an abortion, then you can’t control when you’re going to have children,” she added. “Because I did literally everything I could not to get pregnant.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And any attempt to frame abortion as preventable by birth control has to take into account the many reasons why people might not be able to get contraception — and even reasons why some might not <em>want</em> it. Not all sex is consensual, after all. And even for <a href="https://nwhn.org/much-different-kinds-birth-control-cost-without-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who can plan ahead</a>, birth control <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/birth-control/annual-cost-of-birth-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be expensive</a> — an IUD <a href="https://khn.org/news/contraceptives-birth-control-surprise-bills-women-shouldnt-get-a-bill-for-an-iud-but-sometimes-they-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can run upward of $2,000</a> by the time you include both the device and doctor’s fees, Godfrey said. Then there’s the fact that the forms of birth control least likely to fail are also the ones patients have the least control over. Some doctors have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/why-do-some-doctors-refuse-to-give-women-iuds/2017/10/12/ee1e881e-a3c9-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to give patients IUDs</a> they requested and, in other cases, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010782415301414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to take out</a> IUDs <a href="https://www.insider.com/people-pulling-out-their-iud-to-avoid-costs-doctor-refusal-2021-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patients no longer wanted</a>. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/opinion/iud-implants-contraception-poverty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black and Latino women are more likely</a> to be counseled to use IUDs and encouraged to limit family size, and more likely to be encouraged to use a [birth-control] method they don’t want,” Dehlendorf said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is, birth control might reduce the need for abortions — but it can’t make abortions go away. That’s because the need for abortion goes beyond the capabilities of birth control, Godfrey said. People can be <em>trying</em> to get pregnant and still end up in situations where they want an abortion. There will always be people who couldn’t get reliable birth control. There will always be people who can’t or don’t want to use specific kinds of birth control. And there will always be people whose birth control simply didn’t work. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (May 19, 2022, 10:04 a.m.):</strong> An earlier version of this article misstated the failure rate of condoms. It is about 13 percent, not 24 percent — which is the percentage of nonhospital abortion patients in 2014 who reported using a condom in the month they got pregnant.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew reacts to the outcome of Tuesday’s primaries in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Kentucky, Idaho and Oregon. The results were mixed in terms of which factions in both parties did well. The marquee Republican Senate race in Pennsylvania is still too close to call, and at least two Trump endorsees lost: North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn and Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Are <em>you</em> a racist?” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Do you hate Mexicans?”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are the two questions J.D. Vance, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/jd-vance-wins-republican-nomination-us-senate-ohio-84483088" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the GOP’s nominee for Senate in Ohio</a>, posed to voters in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1511311385543815180?s=20&amp;t=tEvCGX2E3KV-QZLmiqLDPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary election ad</a> in which he accused the media of vilifying Republicans like him for wanting a border wall — and falsely claimed that President Biden had established an “open border” that was “killing Ohioans” because “more illegal drugs and more Democrat voters [were] pouring into this country.” The ad was purposely incendiary, designed to push <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-keep-losing-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader culture-war issues</a>, like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/republicans-politics-us-immigration-midterm-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a>, that the GOP has used time and time again to galvanize their primary base, typically <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-2018-primaries-project-the-demographics-of-primary-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older white voters</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vance is a particularly egregious example of this trend, but <a href="https://www.axios.com/gop-candidates-anti-immigrant-rhetoric-vance-laxalt-7c3d1559-a409-4e0a-a4d8-ee7dc04e6ac8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s hardly alone</a>. Promoting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial grievance politics</a> to appeal to conservative (and often white) voters who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceive a threat</a> to their status at the top of the racial hierarchy is a popular conservative political tactic — one that can have devastating and deadly consequences. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Case in point: the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/shoppers-regulars-retired-police-officer-victims-buffalo-shooting/story?id=84731033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass shooting at a supermarket</a> in a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-shooting-0475a5bd971d23a4e0a13ef840650bb1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predominantly Black neighborhood</a> of Buffalo, New York, on Saturday, which police say was a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/us/buffalo-supermarket-shooting-sunday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racially motivated hate crime</a>. According to reports, the suspect also promulgated the baseless “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/politics/replacement-theory-buffalo-what-matters/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great replacement</a>” conspiracy theory, which claims that non-white people are being brought to the U.S. and other Western countries to “replace” and “disempower” white people to achieve a political agenda. In the attack, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/buffalo-supermarket-shooting-05-17-22/h_dde5248154ded799d66474e30153f594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 of the 13 shooting victims were Black</a>; 10 of them died. And because a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-2022-midterm-elections-covid-health-media-2ebbd3849ca35ec76f0f91120639d9d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable minority of Americans</a> believe in certain tenets of the replacement theory, these messages of white victimhood and the idea that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/28/gop-primary-america-racist-2024-500680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“America is not a racist country”</a> aren’t going anywhere; we’re likely to hear these talking points from the GOP in 2022 and beyond.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[Vance is] trying to give voters a sense of license to have these anxieties, discomforts and sometimes even prejudiced views,” said <a href="https://schar.gmu.edu/profiles/jgest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justin Gest</a>, a professor of policy and government at George Mason University. “Those are precisely the politics that he’s bristling at, and there are going to be voters who appreciate him giving them the license to believe what they believe.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But where does this leave the GOP in its <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/01/21/does-the-gop-have-an-opening-with-black-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efforts</a> to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/-clock-ticking-democrats-defense-republicans-pursue-latino-voters-rcna16745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeal to voters of color</a>, especially the Latinos whom Vance and others have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/us/politics/gop-vote-fraud-immigrants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely cast as bogeymen</a> despite then-President Donald Trump making <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22436307/catalist-equis-2020-latino-vote-trump-biden-florida-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable gains among them</a> in 2020? At first glance, this messaging may seem at odds with a GOP that has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/03/republicans-are-trying-to-rebrand-themselves-as-working-class-heroes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to rebrand itself</a> in fits and spurts as the party of the working class for <em>all</em> Americans. Yet, as counterintuitive as it sounds, these messages of racial grievance could also appeal to voters of color, especially Latino voters,<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all Latinos identify as people of color, and polls are not consistent in how they capture Latinos’ different racial and ethnic identities. Pollsters often treat Hispanic heritage as an ethnicity, asking about race separately, which would allow people to identify as both Black and Latino, white and Latino, or Asian and Latino. But Hispanic is sometimes treated as its own race, which may lead respondents who identify as both Hispanic and white, Black or another race to self-select out of the Hispanic/Latino group. Other times, respondents are simply asked if they identify as Hispanic or Latino. When possible, we use the U.S. Census Bureau’s two-part approach, which asks first about Hispanic identity and then racial identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> who were already open to supporting Republican candidates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Republicans know that white voters are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/26/what-the-2020-electorate-looks-like-by-party-race-and-ethnicity-age-education-and-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upwards of 80 percent of their voters</a>, so everything is targeted toward them,” said <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/fraga-bernard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernard Fraga</a>, a political scientist at Emory University. At the same time, though, he said this kind of message might not turn off minority voters, especially the few who have been receptive to voting for Republicans. “They might be willing to accept that [messaging] because they align with the party on other kinds of policy issues.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How Latino voters <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-no-such-thing-as-the-latino-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think of themselves politically varies</a> depending on where they live, how long their family has been in the U.S., and whether they went to college. Those fault lines are true of most voters in the U.S., but on some issues, Latino voters are unique and might be more open to the GOP’s messaging on race. For instance, while Latinos overall <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-latinos-really-moved-toward-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lean Democratic</a>, some are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/389093/hispanic-americans-party-updated-analysis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open to supporting Republicans</a> or identify as conservative, particularly on certain immigration policies and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/spanish-election-2020-disinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race-related issues</a>, like <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/27/support-for-black-lives-matter-declined-after-george-floyd-protests-but-has-remained-unchanged-since/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Black Lives Matter</a>. Some polling and research also suggests that large chunks of conservative Latino adults <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/us/latino-hispanics-for-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy into American nationalism</a> and believe that issues of race <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2021/11/04/latinos-divided-on-whether-race-gets-too-much-or-too-little-attention-in-the-u-s-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get too much attention</a> in the U.S. today, so they could be receptive to the idea that Democrats are out of step with their views.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think a lot of Latinos are turned off by the hateful rhetoric toward them, but part of the reason that Latinos are a swing vote and that Trump was able to do so well with them in 2020, is because there are a lot of Latinos who think there is too much identity politics going on, think of themselves more as ‘Americans’ and are receptive to the idea that Democrats are always going around calling people racist,” said <a href="https://www.menlo.edu/about/find-an-expert/melissa-michelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melissa Michelson</a>, a political scientist at Menlo College.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to a March 2021 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2021/11/04/latinos-divided-on-whether-race-gets-too-much-or-too-little-attention-in-the-u-s-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from the Pew Research Center</a>, 57 percent of Republican or Republican-leaning Latino adults<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this poll, Latinos included anyone who reported Hispanic identity regardless of their race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> agreed with the statement that “too much attention is paid to race and racial issues in our country these days.” Meanwhile, only 28 percent said that discrimination based on race or skin color was a “very big problem” facing the country today. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for Black Lives Matter was another big dividing line: In September, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/27/support-for-black-lives-matter-declined-after-george-floyd-protests-but-has-remained-unchanged-since/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a> found that among all racial and ethnic minority groups polled, Latino adults<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this poll, Latinos included anyone who reported Hispanic identity regardless of their race. White, Black and Asian respondents were limited to those who indicated they were only one race and not Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> were the <em>least</em> likely to say they supported the movement. While 60 percent of Latino adults said they did support Black Lives Matter, that’s significantly less than the share of Asian adults (68 percent) and Black adults (83 percent) who said the same. (By comparison, only 47 percent of white adults said they supported Black Lives Matter.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The results of the past two presidential elections also suggest that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-exploited-status-anxiety-within-the-latino-community/2020/11/06/3164e77c-1f9f-11eb-b532-05c751cd5dc2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overtly racist rhetoric</a> about Mexicans and immigrants won’t turn off certain Latino voters. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew’s 2020 validated voter analysis</a>, Biden won Latino voters<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this poll, Latinos included anyone who reported Hispanic identity regardless of their race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> by only 21 percentage points — 59 percent to 38 percent — significantly less than Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 38-point edge over Trump among Latino voters in 2016, when she won by 66 percent to 28 percent. Immigration was <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as important to voters</a> as it was <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/07/07/4-top-voting-issues-in-2016-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2016</a>, but it’s still notable that Republicans managed to win a sizable portion of Latino voters while simultaneously leaning into <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/30/918483794/from-debate-stage-trump-declines-to-denounce-white-supremacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messages of white nationalism</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, plenty of Latino voters are conservative on immigration issues — particularly in swing parts of the country, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/border-grievance-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Texas</a> — but pollsters noted that not all Latino voters want the same immigration policies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Latinos generally express high levels of support for a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented and a DACA-like program, but support varies around border-security issues,” said <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/staff/mark-hugo-lopez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Hugo Lopez</a>, Pew’s director of race and ethnicity research. “When you start talking about asylum seekers and offering asylum to those coming from Central America, for example, we’ve found that there’s a significant share of Latinos who feel like there’s not an obligation to help those people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This may be because many Latinos in the U.S. are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/americans-way-number-latinos-think-are-undocumented-poll-finds-rcna2464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not undocumented</a> or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/08/20/facts-on-u-s-immigrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigrants themselves</a> — in fact, their families may have been in the country for several generations — or they don’t know many immigrants personally. According to a March 2021 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/14/around-four-in-ten-latinos-in-u-s-worry-that-they-or-someone-close-to-them-could-be-deported/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a> study, 60 percent of Latino adults said they didn’t worry very much or at all that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported. The longer their family had been in the U.S., the less likely they were to worry. A large majority (81 percent) of third- or higher-generation Latino adults in the U.S.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia or one of the five U.S. territories whose parents were both born in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia or one of the five U.S. territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> — according to Pew’s 2021 National Survey of Latinos, about one-third of registered Latino voters fall into this category — said they did not worry about deportations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The farther you are away from the immigration experience, the more likely you are to be removed from immigration issues and maybe even agree with Republicans’ messaging on race and immigration,” said <a href="https://government.cornell.edu/sergio-i-garcia-rios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sergio Garcia-Rios</a>, a professor of government and Latino studies at Cornell University. “Latinos in Republican states especially are likely to embrace Republican views and remove themselves from the groups being attacked.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, according to a separate November poll from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2021/11/04/measuring-the-racial-identity-of-latinos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a>, close to 3 in 5 Latino adults (58 percent) say that they’re white themselves (although, of course, as I’ve written previously, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what it means to identify as “white”</a> is often a limitation of census categorizations). But at the very least, that means it’s possible that certain Latino voters will embrace messages of white grievance, or at least won’t be completely turned off by it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you’re a Latino who identifies as ‘white’ or ‘American,’ it often doesn’t matter what country you’re from or where your ancestors came from,” Michelson told me. “You can still have a strong white, American identity that makes you receptive to these messages because you want to be part of that community that’s ‘protecting’ the United States from these alleged threats. It’s nice to be on the winning team, and white people in America are still the winning team.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, once Latino adults start to identify more as white than Latino, it’s easy to appeal to them using the same fear-mongering, us-versus-them language that Republicans use on white voters. Fear — like the threat of an “open border” or “illegal drugs” coming into the U.S., as Vance said in his ad — can be a <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/apa/2020/fear-motivator-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powerful motivator</a> in getting voters to cast a ballot one way or the other. And by raising the threat of people crossing the border with Mexico, Republicans might be able to successfully win over both racially conservative white <em>and</em> Latino voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not to say that this messaging necessarily works. As Michelson said, a lot of Latinos are turned off by this rhetoric.<strong> </strong>But even if grievance politics doesn’t <em>attract</em> Latino voters to the GOP, that doesn’t mean it will drive them away, either. As is the case for <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans as a whole</a>, the No. 1 issue for Latino voters is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/11/hispanic-voters-say-economy-health-care-and-covid-19-are-top-issues-in-2020-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy</a>, and that concern may outweigh concerns about racism in the GOP when they’re casting their vote. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Experts were really blindsided by the reduced margins of Democratic victories among Latinos in 2020. So there’s still a scramble to better understand Latino identity, solidarity and what’s driving Latino votes,” Gest, the George Mason University professor, said. “Among some Latinos, we have noticed a clear willingness to overlook some of this rhetoric and anti-immigrant nativism if they feel like their economic prospects will be boosted by Republican candidates.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was especially true in 2020, when Trump won over more Latino voters, in part because there was a sharp drop in how they prioritized immigration issues as well as a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2021-12-17/economy-covid-drove-latino-voters-toward-trump-2020-essential-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steep climb in their emphasis</a> on economic issues instead. In fact, economic messaging may even be an extra potent antidote to the GOP’s racism for immigrants in particular. “The evidence is that the children of immigrants buy into this ‘American dream’ rhetoric and might even be more receptive” to it than later generations, said Fraga, the Emory University professor. “It’s the children of immigrants who have had relative economic success who say that the Republican message — economy, religion, jobs — appeals to them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are plenty of reasons, then, why the GOP’s racism may not be the poison pill for Latino voters that it seems. It’s still important to remember that a majority of Latino voters are Democratic and likely don’t appreciate Republican candidates’ racist rhetoric about them. And despite some Latinos being more conversative on issues of race, many are still liberal on these issues. For instance, according to a December <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-12/Axios%20Latino%20Write%20Up%201pm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios/Ipsos/Telemundo</a> survey, 57 percent of Latino adults did not agree with the statement that America is <em>not</em> a racist country. Moreover, 61 percent agreed that Latino or Hispanic people do not have the same opportunities in the U.S. as white people. So, even if grievance politics appeals to some Latino voters — or at least doesn’t turn them away — this tactic could still backfire. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevertheless, this won’t necessarily deter Republicans from using this kind of racist messaging. Remember, grievance messages aren’t crafted with voters of color in mind — they’re intended to galvanize an overwhelmingly white GOP base whom Republicans often prioritize at the cost of losing other voters, said Fraga. That’s why even if the GOP as a whole were to decide it’s bad politics to demonize Latinos, specific candidates like Vance, who is running in a state that is only <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/OH/PST045221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 percent Latino</a>, would still likely lean into this kind of messaging.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The national party might think, long-term, that it’s better to be more welcoming to Latinos given demographic trends. But it doesn’t matter what the national party wants or envisions as its long-term future since you can’t stop individual candidates from running these types of campaigns and having short-term victories that capitalize on racist stereotypes and economic fears,” Michelson said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s an open question, then, as to whether this messaging will backfire. It’s possible that it will repel more Latino voters than it attracts. It’s possible that it will appeal only to a specific swath of Latino voters. After all, those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/border-grievance-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living along the U.S.-Mexico border</a> have different political priorities than those living in New York. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, it’s possible, too, that this messaging just might work.</p>]]></description>

						<p>This article is part of our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/2022-election/">America's Issues</a> series.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			


<p data-paragraph="main">In 1935, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2748835" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup first asked</a> Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/169682/years-ago-first-gallup-poll.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what they thought</a> was <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most important problem</a> facing the United States. In the midst of the Great Depression, about 3 in 5 Americans mentioned concerns related to the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fast forward nearly 90 years, and countless pollsters regularly ask Americans what’s top of mind for them. But on their own, answers to this question don’t really tell us that much. Issues like “the economy” or “political polarization” are often too broad to define. Moreover, two voters might both say something like “crime” is important to them, but for very different reasons. It’s why understanding how these issues factor into how Americans vote is so challenging.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But understanding how the most important issues facing the country factor into voters’ lives — including what they really know about the issues — is exactly what FiveThirtyEight aims to do. In partnership with <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos</a>, FiveThirtyEight will conduct six polls between now and Election Day, interviewing the same group of around 2,000 Americans about the biggest issues facing the country. By interviewing the same people each month, using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we’ll get a better sense of whether Americans’ concerns are changing and the extent to which those worries will influence the country’s political environment as we move closer to the 2022 midterm elections. We’ll do deep dives into what Americans name as their most pressing concerns and also conduct one FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll after the election to see where things stand after the country has voted.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, the answer to what Americans are most worried about is pretty straightforward: inflation. In the first FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll,<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted April 27-May 5, 2022, among a sample of 2,006 adults that was weighted to match the general population. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.6 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> 52 percent of Americans said the most important issue facing the country was inflation. We asked Americans this question in a variety of ways,<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> but regardless of how we asked it, the top answer was always the same: inflation.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans are most worried about inflation" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SzAiZ/12/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="617" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that a larger percentage of Republicans than Democrats or independents in our poll said they were concerned about inflation. But inflation still led the way regardless of party identification: About two-thirds of Republicans selected it as a top issue, as did about half of all independents and slightly more than 40 percent of Democrats. Inflation was the top issue for respondents of all age groups and for both men and women, too. Now, some Americans did find other issues more important, though. For instance, 43 percent of Black Americans listed “race and racism” as a top concern, while 37 percent named inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But inflation in particular is casting a pall over the lives of Americans of all stripes. “At the end of the month, it’s harder to buy food and pay bills and keep the kids with clothes and sneakers on them,” a Hispanic 48-year old Democratic woman from New York told us. “No matter how much they raise wages, costs exceed them,” said a white 60-year old Republican woman from Pennsylvania. And as a 36-year old man of color from Arizona who identified as independent put it: “It is impacting my spending power and the future wealth of myself and generations that come after me, including my own children.” Moreover, with prices continuing to rise — inflation was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/11/business/inflation-cpi-report-april" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.3 percent in April</a> — these concerns aren’t likely to go away anytime soon.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And most Americans don’t feel like things have improved for them financially, either. Overall, 32 percent said their personal financial circumstances had worsened over the past year, 52 percent said things were about the same, and just 12 percent said they were doing better. Tellingly, 41 percent said they had made a major change to how they live, including a majority (56 percent) of households making less than $50,000 per year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many in our survey said they were driving less, taking fewer vacations or just being more cost-conscious at the grocery store. Put more simply, many Americans are watching what they spend. “I just noticed that I'm really checking my bill a lot more. I actually maintain a spreadsheet just to track how my costs have gone up,” said James Bassett, a 48-year old white man from South Carolina. “It's definitely made me a lot more mindful and taken a little bit more time to process what I need and what I don't need.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the most part, though, Americans have a decent understanding of what inflation and the broader economic situation looks like in the U.S. For instance, a plurality of Americans knew that unemployment is currently at its lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Similarly, slightly more Americans knew that wages <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-employers-labor-costs-inflation-11643331612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were increasing faster</a> over the last year than they had at any point over the previous two decades — even though a plurality said they didn’t know. That said, there were a couple points where a majority of Americans were wrong. Most notably, 51 percent said that inflation was higher now than at any time since World War II, even though inflation <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=rocU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was actually higher at some points</a> in the 1970s and early 1980s.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans understand inflation but overestimate it" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2pcQa/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="433" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Both younger and older Americans, including those who lived through the high inflation periods of the 1970s and ’80s, were likely to say that inflation was higher now. Some <a href="https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/content/recency-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recency bias</a> is probably at play here, but older Americans may also feel a greater pinch from inflation today than they did in earlier decades because they are more likely now to live on a fixed income from a pension or social security. “Once you fall behind, there's no catching up until they give you an increase the following year,” said Jarvis White, a 65-year old Black man from Florida. In his view, the situation in the 1970s and ’80s, even during the <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/oil-shock-of-1973-74" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1970s oil embargo</a>, “pales in comparison” to today’s circumstances.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, a plurality of respondents said U.S. gas prices rank among the highest in the world — <a href="https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/gasoline_prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they don’t</a>. But it’s easy to understand why many Americans think they do. For starters, compared to food, clothing or electricity, gas prices have seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220511125439/https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest percentage increase</a> over the past year, which a majority of respondents answered correctly in a separate question in our poll. Moreover, a lot of Americans drive and have to visit the pump often, especially <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-04/9-reasons-the-u-s-ended-up-so-much-more-car-dependent-than-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared to other countries</a>, so it’s no wonder many thought gas prices were relatively high by global standards. “I work in sales, so I drive a lot. Gas is killing me right now,” said Jeni Johnson, a 53-year old white woman from Michigan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were some differences in how Americans answered these questions based on party. For instance, a much smaller share of Democrats than Republicans (48 percent vs. 86 percent) correctly said inflation wasn’t higher when Donald Trump was president, and a smaller share of Republicans than Democrats (40 percent vs. 57 percent) correctly said that unemployment is at its lowest point since the start of the pandemic, which reflects <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-pessimistic-views-on-the-economy-have-little-to-do-with-the-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how partisanship can color economic views</a>. But broadly speaking, Americans were on the same page, including in some cases for what they thought was responsible for driving inflation. A sizable majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents said that supply chain breakdowns, the COVID-19 pandemic and foreign conflicts had all had a “major” or “significant” impact. From there, though, there was much less agreement, as the chart below shows.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Many Americans blame supply chain, COVID-19 for inflation" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hKyZi/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="390" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Most divides fell along somewhat predictable political lines. For instance, Democrats were more likely to blame businesses, with 70 percent saying that businesses trying to make more profits had made a major or significant impact on price increases and 60 percent saying the same of a lack of competition among businesses, compared with only 45 percent and 39 percent of Republicans, respectively. Conversely, Republicans were more likely to blame government COVID-19 spending programs, with two-thirds saying that it was a major or significant reason for inflation, while only 37 percent of Democrats said the same. Of course, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-and-republicans-get-wrong-about-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither side is fully correct in its assessment of what’s causing inflation</a>, but it does underscore once again how partisanship can influence how Americans interpret economic conditions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of partisan differences, though, half of the respondents in the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll named inflation as a top concern — both for them personally and for the country. And there’s good reason to think that this issue could be a major boon to Republicans’ hopes of taking control of the House and Senate. That’s because independents, about half of whom named inflation as a major worry, aren’t happy with the status quo — only 30 percent had a favorable view of Biden in the poll, compared with 55 percent who had an unfavorable opinion of the president. Independents <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/15/facts-about-us-political-independents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are less likely to vote</a> than Republicans or Democrats, and our survey suggests that about half of all likely voters who are independent haven’t yet decided which major party they’ll support or have decided they will not support either in November. Yet given Biden’s poor numbers among independents and that inflation looks like a long-term problem, Republicans appear to have an easy way to appeal to dissatisfied, less partisan voters who will be more open to a message of change come November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, inflation could very well be the issue that tips the scales this year sharply to the Republicans’ advantage.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Most of the primary action so far this year has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/16-gop-primaries-to-watch-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania-idaho-and-oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Republican side</a>, but Tuesday’s elections in Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idaho is also holding its primary, but there are no Democratic primaries of note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> will also decide the future of the Democratic Party in those states. The party’s progressive wing, which has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting more judicious</a> about picking its battles, has a few golden opportunities to gain new members of Congress. There are also several races where Democrats could add to the diversity of their caucus by nominating a woman, a person of color or both. We’ll even get our first big test this year of how much influence the cryptocurrency industry and pro-Israel groups have in the Democratic Party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here’s everything you need to know about the 12 Democratic primaries we’re following today. And don’t forget to join us tonight at 6 p.m. Eastern for our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a> of the results.</p>

John Yarmuth announced he was retiring from Kentucky’s solidly blue <strong>3rd Congressional District</strong>, it had the potential to set off a scramble to replace him. But instead, Louisville politicos mostly <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/07/rep-john-yarmuth-endorses-morgan-mcgarvey-race-succeed-him/6669338001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coalesced around</a> state Senate Minority Leader Morgan McGarvey. McGarvey has raised by far the most money in the field (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2KY03206/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1.5 million</a>) and has also benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=KY03&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $1 million</a> in outside spending from Protect Our Future PAC, which is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/19/crypto-super-pac-campaign-finance-00026146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely funded</a> by 30-year-old billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, who founded the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. (This isn’t the last time Protect Our Future will appear in this primary preview.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While McGarvey is <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/03/morgan-mcgarvey-attica-scott-legalized-marijuana-defund-police/7411277001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberal on most issues</a> (he supports single-payer health care and the Green New Deal), he is still facing a challenge on his left from state Rep. Attica Scott, who entered the race before Yarmuth announced his retirement. Scott, who would be Kentucky’s first Black member of Congress, supports defunding the police and canceling all student-loan debt, which McGarvey opposes. However, she has raised only <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2KY03172/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$236,476</a>, and perhaps in an acknowledgment of her long odds, only two major progressive organizations (the <a href="https://www.boldprogressives.org/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progressive Change Campaign Committee</a> and <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>) have endorsed her.</p>



<h2><strong>North Carolina</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 1st, 4th and 13th congressional districts<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7:30 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Outside spending is also frustrating progressive bids in a couple North Carolina House primaries. In the state’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong>, Rep. G.K. Butterfield is retiring and has <a href="https://www.wral.com/butterfield-backs-moderate-democrat-davis-in-race-for-northeastern-nc-congressional-district/20251525/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> state Sen. Don Davis to succeed him, arguing that the moderate Davis would be Democrats’ strongest general-election candidate in a seat that will likely be competitive in 2022. (It has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> of just D+5.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, progressive figures like the PCCC and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are backing former state Sen. Erica Smith, who has tried to make the race about Davis’s <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article261058357.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotty support for abortion rights</a> in the wake of the Supreme Court’s leaked draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Smith has outraised Davis <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NC02238/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$831,937</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NC02287/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$612,266</a>, but Davis has benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NC01&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $2.3 million</a> in outside spending from the <a href="https://businessnc.com/new-aipac-money-boosting-don-davis-valerie-foushee-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Democracy Project</a>, a pro-Israel super PAC funded by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The primary still looks competitive, though: Despite the Davis campaign recently releasing a <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1524783941823111171?s=20&amp;t=WN9TJJXH0Lo6saTV1Val3w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> giving himself a 13-point lead, that isn’t very convincing since internal polls often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overstate their sponsors’ positions</a> by several percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Bankman-Fried (the cryptocurrency magnate) and AIPAC are also <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article260975442.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pouring money</a> into the Democratic primary to replace retiring Rep. David Price in North Carolina’s safely blue <strong>4th District</strong>, around Durham. Protect Our Future has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NC04&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> and the United Democracy Project nearly $2.1 million to help state Sen. Valerie Foushee defeat Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam and singer Clay Aiken. (Yes, <a href="https://americanidol.fandom.com/wiki/Clay_Aiken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that Clay Aiken</a>.) AIPAC has probably gotten involved here due to Allam’s history of <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2021/11/a-north-carolina-congressional-candidate-has-a-long-history-of-anti-israel-activism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Israel activism</a>, but its investment has <a href="https://indyweek.com/news/elections/nc-4th-congressional-district-democratic-primary-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rubbed some voters the wrong way</a> given that it also supports Republicans and Allam is Muslim. (Her religion has also made her the target of <a href="https://www.wral.com/singer-state-senator-activist-highlight-congressional-race-in-durham-chapel-hill/20268712/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islamophobic push polls</a> and death threats.) The Progressive Caucus of the North Carolina Democratic Party even <a href="https://www.pcncdp.org/press" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revoked its endorsement</a> of Foushee for accepting AIPAC’s money. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The three candidates have all embraced progressive policy platforms, but it’s Allam who has gained endorsements from the movement’s big names: <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article260858882.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a>, <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/05/10/ocasio-cortez-endorses-strong-progressives-allam-and-lee-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> and the <a href="https://www.peoplesalliancepac.org/people_s_alliance_pac_endorses_candidates_running_in_2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People’s Alliance</a>, a local progressive group. Foushee’s backers include the <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article260319695.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People</a> and <a href="https://www.emilyslist.org/candidates/valerie-foushee-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMILY’s List</a>, which are closer to the Democratic Party establishment but also reflect her identity as a Black woman. EMILY’s List also commissioned the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17mBEV112uPiqfm0F2ed2F_ltSnV_xWXO/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only poll</a> we’ve seen of the race, which put Foushee at 35 percent, Allam at 16 percent and Aiken at 10 percent. (Remember, though, EMILY’s List is not a neutral observer here.) If no candidate receives more than 30 percent of the vote, the race will go to a runoff on July 26.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Democratic primary is a little more low-key in the <strong>13th District</strong>, an open seat in the Raleigh suburbs. The front-runner seems to be state Sen. Wiley Nickel, who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NC14019/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.4 million</a> ($900,000 of it from his own pocket). However, former state Sen. Sam Searcy, a moderate with a <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/opinion/wake-democrats-are-key-in-13th-district-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputation for bipartisan dealmaking</a> in the legislature, could be Democrats’ best bet to win here in November. With a partisan lean of R+3, this seat could be an uphill climb for Democrats in a Republican-leaning midterm.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the Democratic primary for North Carolina’s <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> seat isn’t expected to be competitive, but it’s worth a brief mention considering that Democrats are hoping to make a run at this seat in the fall. Their nominee will almost certainly be former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who overwhelmingly leads her 10 opponents in <a href="https://www.meredith.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spring2022PollReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary polling</a> and would be the first Black female senator since Kamala Harris if she wins.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A distinction that other women, such as Pennsylvania’s Kathy Barnette or Florida’s Val Demings, could also share.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, 12th and 17th congressional districts<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Republican primary for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> in Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/kathy-barnette-oz-mccormick-attack-pa-senate-20220512.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devolves into chaos</a>, the Democratic one is likely to be a coronation. Despite recent news that he had <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-05-15/fetterman-treated-at-lancaster-hospital-after-suffering-stroke-during-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a stroke</a>, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is the clear front-runner, thanks to being an <a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/personality/2021/06/how-john-fetterman-redefined-role-lieutenant-governor/364575/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely active lieutenant governor</a> and raising more money than any other candidate (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S6PA00274/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16.0 million</a>). According to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOQISg8HPNhtCK72dKVoGbHB3oMeoRRs/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> from Franklin &amp; Marshall College, Fetterman leads his closest competitor by 39 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not to say that other candidates haven’t tried to take him down. Centrist Rep. Conor Lamb is running on the argument that he is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/us/politics/conor-lamb-pennsylvania-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more electable</a>, but voters don’t seem to be buying it; Fetterman’s tough, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/john-fetterman-pa-senate-race-endorsements-20220511.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsider</a> image (literally — he is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/04/16/john-fetterman-profile-2022-senate-politics-pennsylvania-481259" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6′ 8″, is heavily tattooed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnFetterman/status/1487142012881186818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1487142012881186818%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbiden-democrats-scheduling-conflict-2022-midterms-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wore basketball shorts</a> to meet President Biden) seems tailor-made to win back the white, working-class voters who have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-pennsylvania-could-decide-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made Pennsylvania a slightly Republican-leaning state</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta has been running as the most progressive candidate in the race, but Fetterman has no shortage of progressive cred either, as he was one of Sanders’s <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/04/john-fettermans-senate-campaign-needs-bernie-sanders-help.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earliest supporters</a>. Kenyatta, who would be both <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/malcolm-kenyatta-senate-2022-pennsylvania-primary-election-20220503.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s first Black and first openly gay senator</a>, has also <a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/kenyatta-criticizes-fetterman-over-black-jogger-incident-in-virtual-senate-forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized Fetterman</a> over a 2013 incident in which he <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/who-is-john-fetterman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chased a Black jogger while armed with a shotgun</a>. <a href="https://johnfetterman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GBAO-JF-memo-041122-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls show</a> that Fetterman does, indeed, <a href="https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/717159/in-pennsylvania-black-voters-concerns-go-beyond-fetterman-gun-incident/?unlock=57OAFJZ96TX32RNU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggle with Black voters</a>, but he still has a wide lead among white Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Progressives’ biggest test in Pennsylvania will likely be the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh’s <strong>12th Congre</strong><strong>ssional District</strong>, a safely Democratic open seat. Virtually every progressive influencer under the sun — <a href="https://justicedemocrats.com/candidate/summer-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Democrats</a>, <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>, the <a href="https://www.boldprogressives.org/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCCC</a>, <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-03-17/bernie-sanders-backs-summer-lee-in-12th-congressional-district-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanders</a>, <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/05/10/ocasio-cortez-endorses-strong-progressives-allam-and-lee-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ocasio-Cortez</a>, <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/endorsements?page=0&amp;q=summer%20lee#summer-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warren</a> — has lined up behind state Rep. Summer Lee. And as of a couple months ago at least, Lee looked like the front-runner: She led attorney Steve Irwin 38 percent to 13 percent in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-1eae-dc88-a7be-1efe8fe10000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March poll</a> sponsored by EMILY’s List (which also <a href="https://emilyslist.org/candidates/summer-lee-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports Lee</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But AIPAC is trying to stop progressives here, too: The United Democracy Project has dropped <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=PA12&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.4 million</a> to help Irwin, who has also outraised Lee <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA18218/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA18200/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$707,344</a>. (A third candidate, law professor Jerry Dickinson, has also raised a respectable <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0PA18097/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$685,185</a>.) Irwin also has the support of Rep. Mike Doyle, the district’s current congressman, and Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, who has argued that Lee (who is Black) would <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/05/12/the-war-in-the-12th-district-bernie-sanders-summer-lee-democratic-party-pittsburgh/stories/202205120151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join the “Squad” in obstructing Biden’s agenda</a>. Without any more recent public polls, it’s tough to say if the spending has made an impact, but both sides are treating this like a competitive race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By comparison, the Democratic primary one district over — in the suburban <strong>17th District</strong> — has <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-05-12/democrats-compete-in-overlooked-but-potentially-crucial-17th-congressional-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten little attention</a>. The race, however, is still important because the district (Lamb’s old seat) has a partisan lean of only D+1, meaning it will likely be very competitive in November. Navy veteran and professor Chris Deluzio, who has the endorsement of the <a href="https://www.politicspa.com/allegheny-dems-back-irwin-deluzio-for-house/100610/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allegheny County Democratic Party</a>, has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17103/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$501,839</a>, while Sean Meloy, a political operative who works to elect LGBTQ candidates, has reeled in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17137/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$251,449</a>. Meloy <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/democratic-primary-to-replace-conor-lamb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identifies as a progressive</a> but hasn’t gotten endorsements from any of the usual progressive suspects.</p>



<h2><strong>Oregon</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 4th, 5th and 6th congressional districts; governor<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern in the Mountain time zone part of Malheur County, 11 p.m. Eastern in the rest of the state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you thought outside groups were investing a lot of money in today’s other Democratic primaries, get a load of Oregon’s<strong> 6th Congressional District</strong>, an open, Democratic-leaning seat. Lawyer Carrick Flynn <a href="https://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/elections/oregon-congressional-candidate-has-attracted-6m-from-national-pacs/article_932272ab-31b5-5ea8-84ef-d10433a768cb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t seem like much of a threat</a> when he entered the race against multiple other candidates with more political experience, but then Protect Our Future spent a whopping <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=OR06&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$11.3 million</a> to help elect him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The investment <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/04/25/what-does-a-crypto-tycoon-want-with-oregons-new-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused many people to wonder</a> why a cryptocurrency magnate is so interested in the race; although Flynn’s wife and Bankman-Fried briefly worked for the same organization, Flynn says he and Bankman-Fried have never met. The answer appears to be that Flynn and Bankman-Fried share the same philosophy of “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/12/carrick-flynn-save-world-congress-00031959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective altruism</a>” and both believe in investing against long-term threats like future pandemics. (Protect Our Future’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2022/02/08/big-money-enters-dem-vs-dem-primary-00006746" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated goal</a> is to support candidates with a “long term view on policy planning, especially as it relates to pandemic preparedness and prevention”; Flynn <a href="https://pamplinmedia.com/sg/77-news/534952-428222-vernonia-native-enters-congressional-race-in-sixth-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted research</a> into pandemic prevention at Oxford University in 2015.) However, Protect Our Future’s involvement has also <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/05/04/how-oregons-new-congressional-district-could-become-a-colony-ruled-by-a-distant-crypto-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised questions</a> of Flynn’s independence as Congress <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/04/26/congress-members-cryptocurrency-market-regulation-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considers more regulations</a> on the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just the cryptocurrency industry backing Flynn; the <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/04/11/house-democrats-pac-buys-ads-for-carrick-flynn-in-cd6-irks-other-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic establishment is behind him too</a>.

Teresa Alonso León, state Rep. Andrea Salinas and former Multnomah County Commissioner Loretta Smith. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Salinas appears to be Flynn’s main competition; she sports a couple prominent progressive endorsements (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/11/warren-oregon-primary-00031695" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warren</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/news/campaign/3484941-jayapal-endorses-six-progressive-house-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep.

But there are nine Democrats on the ballot in all, two of whom have raised more than $1 million (albeit with the help of self-funding): Army veteran Cody Reynolds (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR01216/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.7 million</a>) and Intel engineer Matt West (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR06041/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.0 million</a>). The <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1522256265006796801?s=20&amp;t=_7I3dhomS_pEXbp5e8EooA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one public poll</a> of the primary we’ve seen, from Salinas’s campaign, shows a free-for-all of a race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, the Democratic primary for the <strong>5th District</strong> is a head-to-head race between incumbent Rep. Kurt Schrader and attorney Jamie McLeod-Skinner. According to <a href="https://voteview.com/person/20944/kurt-schrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DW-NOMINATE</a>, a common way of measuring the ideology of members of Congress, Schrader is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, and he has infuriated progressives with his <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/politics/oregon-rep-kurt-schrader-explains-his-vote-against-coronavirus-relief-bill-minimum-wage/283-11d94feb-ec1a-4248-a2ec-4d1949632787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote against</a> Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill and comment that former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment was a “<a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2021/01/rep-kurt-schrader-apologizes-after-likening-trump-impeachment-to-lynching.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lynching</a>.” McLeod-Skinner is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/22/progressives-kurt-schrader-congress-oregon-primary-00019083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging him from the left</a>, hoping to make him the second incumbent to lose renomination this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Progressives like <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1498298641404076037?s=20&amp;t=8xRpsYjtQTIcr6j0vWdGrw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warren</a> and <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a> have endorsed McLeod-Skinner — though interestingly, others (Justice Democrats, Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) have kept their powder dry. However, Schrader boasts the <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/04/23/president-joe-biden-endorses-incumbent-kurt-schrader-for-5th-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support of Biden</a>, who (unlike <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his predecessor</a>) rarely wades into intraparty fights. (This is just the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Endorsements_by_Joe_Biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second Democratic primary</a> in which he has endorsed as president.) Many Democrats fear that nominating McLeod-Skinner would help Republicans flip the seat, which has a partisan lean of just D+3, this fall. However, Schrader may not be a particularly strong candidate himself; he did 1.7 points worse than Biden in his district in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Schrader has a massive financial advantage in the race (he’s spent nearly <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8OR05107/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 million</a>, and pro-Schrader outside groups have added another <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=OR05&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.1 million</a>; meanwhile, McLeod-Skinner having spent just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8OR02161/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$579,044</a>), and he’s <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/politics/elections/results-in-the-oregon-us-house-fifth-district-primary-race/283-2d477a9d-97df-4401-a344-879dcffeb856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned back</a> progressive primary challenges before. However, his district’s boundaries were drastically changed in redistricting; 53 percent of the district is new to him, so his incumbency may not give him a big advantage this time around. We haven’t seen any recent surveys of the race, but <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/2022-primaries/may-massacre-primary-alarm-bells-multiple-house-incumbents?check_logged_in=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private polling</a> reportedly gives McLeod-Skinner the lead. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door in the <strong>4th District</strong>, eight Democrats are competing to succeed retiring Rep. Peter DeFazio. State Labor Commissioner Val Hoyle is the front-runner, having earned <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/04/27/oregon-4th-congressional-district-candidates-primary-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFazio’s endorsement</a> and raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR04095/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$782,440</a>. By contrast, attorney Andrew Kalloch has taken in just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR04103/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$275,014</a>, and environmental activist Doyle Canning has raised just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/OR/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$232,545</a>. Canning has earned the support of <a href="https://www.canningforcongress.com/endorsements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several local progressive groups</a>, but most of the big national players haven’t stuck their necks out for her, perhaps reflecting the size of <a href="http://climatehawksvote.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OR4Results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoyle’s lead</a> (16 points, according to a poll sponsored by a group that supports Canning). With a partisan lean of D+9, this district will probably stay in Democratic hands this fall, but it’s not a sure thing — a fact that DeFazio and Hoyle have used to argue Canning would be a <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-ore-dems-are-turning-their-backs-on-green-candidate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risky nominee</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, Oregon Democrats will also pick their nominee for <strong>governor</strong>. With the retirement of incumbent Gov. Kate Brown, it’s the first open Oregon gubernatorial election since 2010, and an impressive 15 candidates qualified for the Democratic primary. (Not included in that number: former New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who tried to run but was <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/02/nick-kristof-cant-run-for-oregon-governor-supreme-court-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled ineligible</a> because he did not meet the residency requirement.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the race is probably between <a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/28/oregon-tina-kotek-tobias-read-lead-field-of-15-democrats-for-governor-2022-primary-election/65352487007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just two candidates</a>: former state House Speaker Tina Kotek and state Treasurer Tobias Read. Kotek, who would make history as the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-lgbt-politics/oregon-democrat-tina-kotek-vies-to-become-first-openly-lesbian-u-s-governor-idUSL8N2UD3Y7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first openly lesbian governor</a> of any state,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A distinction she may share with Massachusetts’s Maura Healey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> has raised <a href="https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/publicAccountSummary.do?filerId=4792&amp;OWASP_CSRFTOKEN=C2W4-66G1-DGNS-F62H-MZNE-2MB9-VPRJ-VF7Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.6 million</a> for the year, while Read has raised <a href="https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/publicAccountSummary.do?filerId=5208&amp;OWASP_CSRFTOKEN=C2W4-66G1-DGNS-F62H-MZNE-2MB9-VPRJ-VF7Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.1 million</a>. Read looks like he’s playing catchup in the polls, too: An <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21609323/41322-tobias-read-for-governor-poll-memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April poll</a> sponsored by his campaign put Kotek at 25 percent and Read at 20 percent, but we don’t have any more recent data. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The winner of the primary will be favored to be the next governor of Oregon, but it’ll probably be a competitive campaign. Oregon is a close enough state that it can be flipped in good election years for Republicans (like 2022 is shaping up to be), and there is also an independent candidate, <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/12/14/oregon-state-senator-betsy-johnson-resigning-governor-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Democratic state Sen. Betsey Johnson</a>, who could siphon off Democratic votes.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday is the busiest election day of the year so far, as five states — Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania — hold their 2022 primaries. And for the GOP, it will be another test of whether to move on from former President Donald Trump. Coming off Nebraska last week — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-candidate-lost-in-nebraska-but-trump-is-still-winning-most-of-his-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his first loss of the year</a> — Trump has endorsed candidates in seven major primaries on Tuesday, which should give us a clearer answer as to his power in the party. And even in races where Trump has no skin in the game, Republicans are considering nominating someone in his incendiary, illiberal mold — which could make it harder for the GOP to pick up seats in November. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, it’s the highest-stakes primary day yet. Here are the 16 (!) Republican primaries to keep an eye on:</p>



<h2><strong>North Carolina</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 1st, 11th and 13th congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7:30 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s first — and easiest — test will come in North Carolina’s <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> race, which is open this year because Sen. Richard Burr is retiring. Former Gov. Pat McCrory started the race <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/carolinajournal.com/app/uploads/2021/04/28093026/NC_US_Senate_GOP_Primary_Survey-NC_US_CJ_Smart_Charts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way ahead in the polls</a>, probably due to name recognition, but last June, Trump <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article251961783.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw his weight behind</a> Rep. Ted Budd, who at the time was polling in the single digits. That gave Budd a boost, but even <a href="https://tedbudd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TB4S-March-Polling-Memo-March-11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Budd’s own polling</a> found he was still trailing McCrory by a few percentage points as recently as the beginning of March. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/09/trump-budd-north-carolina-struggles-senate-primary-00015472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump noticed</a> and even reportedly tried to get a third candidate, Rep. Mark Walker, to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/05/donald-trump-ted-budd-north-carolina-523779" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop out</a> in order to consolidate the Trumpist vote. (Walker has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-donald-trump-north-carolina-senate-elections-greensboro-f589a94f847c321ae07effab69aa092c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stayed put</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Starting in March, though, Budd <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/11/trump-ted-budd-north-carolina-senate-00024322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned on the jets</a>, and the <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/ted-budd-solidifies-frontrunner-status-in-us-senate-gop-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> (conducted May 7-9 by Emerson College) showed him at 43 percent, McCrory at 16 percent and Walker at 12 percent. But the Republican kingmaker most responsible for the surge probably wasn’t Trump, but rather the Club for Growth, an anti-government-spending outside group that has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NCS2&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about $11 million</a> on Budd’s behalf. Many of the group’s <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/5192236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads</a> have also slammed McCrory for being <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/icymi-new-nc-sen-valentines-day-tv-ad-on-mccrorys-love-for-liberals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too liberal</a> (though his governorship was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/12/conservative-governor-north-carolina-rino-pat-mccrory-00031996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anything but</a>) and accepting the results of the 2020 election, explaining why the onetime front-runner has cratered as much as Budd has risen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump and the Club for Growth are also backing the same candidate in the GOP primary for North Carolina’s open <strong>13th District</strong>: 26-year-old former college football player Bo Hines. However, Hines has <a href="https://www.wral.com/hines-faces-gop-pushback-to-congressional-bid-ahead-of-nc-trump-rally/20225052/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced criticism</a> for his weak ties to the district and <a href="https://www.wral.com/triangle-congressional-candidate-bo-hines-moves-to-district-a-month-out-from-election/20258384/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shopping around</a> for a place to launch a long-awaited political career (“[T]he ultimate goal would be president,” <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/college/football/article29408317.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hines said</a> all the way back in 2015). He filed to run in two different districts before choosing this one, about 100 miles east of where he lived at the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Together, the Club for Growth and a super PAC <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/388683-freedom-caucus-bruised-but-unbowed-in-gop-primary-fights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aligned</a> with the ideologically similar House Freedom Caucus have spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NC13&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $2 million</a> to help elect Hines. However, through April 27, attorney Kelly Daughtry had spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NC04200/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $2.7 million</a> of mostly her own money on the race. Former Rep. Renee Ellmers may also have lingering name recognition from representing part of the district from 2011 to 2017, and Army veteran Kent Keirsey, who has the endorsement of potential 2024 presidential candidate and Arkansas Sen. <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article260341675.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Cotton</a>, can’t be counted out either. With eight total candidates in the running, this race may very well go to a runoff, which under North Carolina law will occur on July 26 if no candidate receives more than 30 percent of the vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another race that could go to a runoff is the Republican primary in the <strong>11th District</strong>, where seven Republicans are seeking to deny incumbent Rep. Madison Cawthorn a second term. The youngest person elected to Congress in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54823890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 50 years</a>, Cawthorn quickly became a darling of MAGA conservatives but also a source of controversy, both encouraging people trying to overturn the 2020 election results to “<a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/2021/01/12/cawthorn-told-trump-supporters-lightly-threaten-members-congress/6638181002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lightly threaten</a>” members of Congress and calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “<a href="https://www.wral.com/us-rep-madison-cawthorn-calls-zelensky-thug/20180199/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thug</a>.” And in late March, he bizarrely claimed his fellow GOP lawmakers had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/politics/madison-cawthorn-orgy-invite-cocaine-claim/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invited him to an orgy</a> and done cocaine in front of him — which he later admitted to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy were <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/03/30/cawthorn-mccarthy-orgy-cocaine-exaggerated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exaggerations</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These incidents seem to have earned him the enmity of his fellow Republicans. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis has <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/politics/north-carolina-politics/thom-tillis-endorse-chuck-edwards-madison-cawthorn-north-carolina-house-primary/275-78e75a65-5c5c-42d2-9c31-6449f821e248" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> primary challenger state Sen. Chuck Edwards. It’s also marked the beginning of an epic parade of bad headlines that appear to have been the result of a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-relentless-campaign-to-ruin-madison-cawthorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated opposition-research dump</a> from his opponents, ranging from the embarrassing (images have emerged of him <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/22/madison-cawthorn-photos-00027286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wearing lingerie</a>, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10764209/GOP-Rep-Madison-Cawthorn-caught-video-male-staff-members-hand-crotch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being touched on the crotch by a male staffer</a> and <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/politics/madison-cawthorn-leaked-nude-video-response-blackmail-north-carolina-primary/275-67324779-a94f-4ee7-8a42-aeb409599ecb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simulating a sex act while naked beside a friend</a>) to the illegal (he appears to have engaged in <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/madison-cawthorn-implicated-in-potential-insider-trading-scheme-experts-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insider trading</a> and violated House rules on the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/madison-cawthorn-may-have-a-new-ethics-violation-to-handle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">payment of staffers</a>). This is on top of older scandals like accusations of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/madison-cawthorn-sexual-misconduct-allegations-patrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexually harassing women</a>, <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article260515652.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving with a revoked license</a> and carrying a <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article260774752.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loaded gun into an airport</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The latest controversies have all happened so quickly that it’s hard to know whether they have put Cawthorn in danger of losing renomination (or getting forced into a runoff). We could find only <a href="https://gopacelect.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NC-CD11_GOP-Primary-Topline-4-27-222.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one public poll</a> of the race since the “orgy” comments, and it showed Cawthorn leading Edwards, 38 percent to 21 percent, with the six other candidates combining for 21 percent — hardly an impressive showing for Cawthorn, but good enough for a win. That said, the <a href="https://gopacelect.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NC-New-CD11_GOP-Primary-Topline-3-14-22-0021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same pollster</a> had shown Cawthorn leading Edwards, 49 percent to 14 percent, in mid-March, so the bad press appears to be having <em>some</em> effect — and even the most recent poll was conducted before the release of the sexually explicit videos, so it’s possible he has fallen further since then. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, it’s also possible that the bad headlines <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBj8r1-fDo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crowd each other out</a> or simply become noise: While outside groups have deployed <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NC11&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> against Cawthorn, the incumbent has spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NC11233/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $3.6 million</a>. And although Trump has reportedly been “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/madison-cawthorn-videos-trump-maga-endorsement-1350478/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weirded out</a>” by Cawthorn’s actions, Cawthorn still has the considerable asset that is the former president’s <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/2021/03/31/cawthorn-gets-maskless-trump-endorsement-florida-mar-lago-face-outbreaks/7054046002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cawthorn isn’t the only North Carolina Republican congressional candidate facing a barrage of scandals, though. The GOP primary for North Carolina’s open <strong>1st District</strong> was fairly quiet until Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson’s campaign recently dropped a <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/sandy-vs-sandy-gop-primary-in-nc1-heats-up-with-bankruptcy-abuse-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trove of opposition research</a> against his best-funded opponent, 2020 nominee Sandy Smith. The documents allege that Smith abused her ex-husbands, ran financial scams, changed her identity and more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roberson has argued that the scandals make Smith unelectable in November, and he may have a point: With a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> of D+5, the district is winnable for Republicans, but a scandal-plagued or extreme Republican candidate could ensure it stays in Democratic hands. And Smith is both: In addition to the claims in the opposition research, she also <a href="https://twitter.com/SandySmithNC/status/1347016673115709440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended Trump’s Jan. 6 rally</a> and believes the 2020 election was stolen. Perhaps in reaction, the Congressional Leadership Fund — a super PAC close to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — is spending $584,000 on a <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1524483788046229508" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV ad</a> attacking Smith. With no public polls of the primary, though, either candidate could still win.</p>



<h2><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 7th, 8th and 17th congressional districts; governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pennsylvania’s Republican primary for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> started off with an embarrassment for Trump; will it end that way too? With the <a href="https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/swingcounty/2020/10/pa-sen-pat-toomey-to-retire-at-end-of-term-in-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retirement</a> of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/pat-toomey-trump-impeachment-trial-vote-20210213.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to convict Trump</a> for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, the former president doubtlessly saw an opportunity to replace Toomey with a loyalist, and this past September, he <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/trump-endorses-sean-parnell-pennsylvania-senate-race-20210901.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> Army veteran Sean Parnell, his close ally. However, in November, Parnell’s estranged wife <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/sean-parnell-wife-abuse-choke-senate-hearing-20211101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified</a> that Parnell had choked her and hit their children, and he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2021/11/22/Judge-rules-that-estranged-wife-of-Sean-Parnell-gets-sole-legal-custody-of-couple-s-children-Senate-Republican/stories/202111220099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out of the race</a> shortly thereafter, leaving behind a fractured Republican field.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Celebrity physician Mehmet Oz emerged as the next <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/TRF-PA-22-GOP-Sen-Primary-0209-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">front-runner</a>, thanks in part to his <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/oz-mccormick-sands-tv-spending-pa-senate-2022-20220114.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big ad buys</a>. Trump has also <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2022/04/09/donald-trump-endorses-mehmet-oz-pennsylvania-senate-primary-race/stories/202204090053" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a>, but interestingly, that hasn’t sewn up the race. Oz has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/25/dr-oz-senate-race-stumbles-00002056" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had trouble</a> persuading Pennsylvania Republicans that he is truly one of them. According to a <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/PA-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-May-3-7_release-May-10-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 3-7 poll</a> from Fox News, 46 percent of the state’s Republican primary voters viewed him unfavorably, compared with just 45 percent who viewed him favorably.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could be partially because Oz has previously spoken out against abortion restrictions, called for stricter gun control laws and encouraged masking to stop the spread of COVID-19 (though he now <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-conservative-policy-pa-senate-race-20220419.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embraces more conservative positions</a>). A <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/does-dr-oz-live-in-pennsylvania-20211202.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longtime resident of New Jersey</a>, he also moved to Pennsylvania only in late 2020. Oz, who would be <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/mehmet-oz-pennsylvania-senate-race-republican-turkey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Muslim U.S. senator</a>, has also had his loyalty to the U.S. questioned because of his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/10/senate-republicans-mehmet-oz-dual-citizenship-00031541" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dual U.S.-Turkey citizenship</a> (he says he would <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-dual-turkish-citizenship-pa-senate-race-20220316.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renounce his Turkish citizenship</a> if he were to win).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another reason Oz has struggled? Honor Pennsylvania — a super PAC set up to support his main opponent, former hedge fund manager David McCormick. Honor Pennsylvania has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00798116/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $15 million</a> attacking Oz for, among other things, being a “<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/ads-attacking-dr-oz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollywood liberal</a>.” Ironically, though, McCormick <em>also</em> has a weak claim on being a Pennsylvania Republican. Although he <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/david-mccormick-running-for-pa-senate-2022-20220113.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grew up in the commonwealth</a>, he lived in Connecticut until last year. He also <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/dr-ozs-anti-woke-gop-rival-david-mccormick-has-a-trans-positive-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener">championed social-justice initiatives</a> at his hedge fund, has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/vote-veteran-to-get-the-job-done/2018/05/23/3ae4c9fc-5ea9-11e8-b2b8-08a538d9dbd6_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported Democrats in the past</a> and called the Jan. 6 riot “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/us/politics/david-mccormick-maga-gop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dark chapter in American history</a>.” However, he has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-04-06/mccormick-vs-dr-oz-ex-bridgewater-ceo-gets-trumpy-in-pa-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinvented himself during the campaign</a> as a faithful follower of Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For months, the race seemed like it was between Oz and McCormick. Through April 27, their <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00638/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigns</a> had each spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00661/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$14 million</a> (most of it from each candidate’s personal wealth) — and that doesn’t even include outside spending like Honor Pennsylvania’s. But as they went nuclear on each other, a third candidate has <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/kathy-barnette-momentum-pa-senate-2022-20220511.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught fire in the race</a>: author Kathy Barnette. Although she has raised just a fraction of their cash (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00489/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than $1.8 million</a>), Barnette has turned heads with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/us/politics/pennsylvania-gop-races.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong debate performances</a> and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=z6xtY5AnJk8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspiring life story</a>. In particular, Barnette’s statement that she is the “<a href="https://nypost.com/2022/05/05/gop-senate-hopeful-kathy-barnette-reveals-she-is-a-product-of-rape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">byproduct of a rape</a>” has <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/05/gop-senate-candidate-kathy-barnette-im-the-product-of-rape-but-was-never-just-a-clump-of-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained traction</a> in <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/05/05/kathy-barnette-slams-dr-oz-on-abortion-i-am-the-byproduct-of-rape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative media</a> as the Supreme Court has brought abortion to the forefront.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TRF-PA-GOP-Sen-Primary-0508-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 6-8 poll</a> from the Trafalgar Group essentially showed a three-way tie, with Oz at 25 percent, Barnette at 23 percent and McCormick at 22 percent. It’s possible, too, that Barnette, who would be the first Black Republican woman to serve in the Senate, could still be on the rise: She gained a powerful ally last week when the Club for Growth announced it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/us/politics/kathy-barnette-pennsylvania-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend $2 million on TV ads</a> for her — more than her campaign has spent all year. But her surge has <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/kathy-barnette-oz-mccormick-attack-pa-senate-20220512.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alarmed other, more establishment-minded Republicans</a>, who worry that nominating Barnette would make it more likely that Democrats flip the seat in November. Barnette has made <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/politics/kfile-kathy-barnette-bigoted-statements/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hateful comments</a> about <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1524140417209483266?s=20&amp;t=ml3ZztFuSfMEB7S_8F2ydg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islam</a> and <a href="https://canadafreepress.com/article/can-christianity-and-the-homosexual-agenda-co-exist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homosexuality</a>, and she <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/a/pennsylvania-voter-fraud-audit-kathy-barnette-20210726.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell deep down the election-fraud rabbit hole</a> after the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans face a similar danger in the <strong>governor</strong>’s race, where state Sen. Doug Mastriano is a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-governor-race-polls-mastriano-barletta-mcswain-white-20220510.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slight front-runner</a> over a weak nine-candidate field. (In the Trafalgar poll, Mastriano had 28 percent support, 10 points ahead of his closest rival.) Like Barnette (with whom he sometimes campaigns), Mastriano is on the far-right fringe of the GOP: He has embraced <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/doug-mastriano-governor-christian-nationalism-qanon-20220504.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian nationalism</a> — the belief that the U.S. was <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/a-pennsylvania-lawmaker-and-the-resurgence-of-christian-nationalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded as a Christian nation that is now under attack</a> — and shared <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/qanon-conspiracy-theory/pa-state-sen-doug-mastriano-promoted-qanon-twitter-over-50-times" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAnon conspiracy theories</a> on social media. He has also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/14/politics/trump-pennsylvania-mastriano-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped lead the charge</a> to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Pennsylvania and was <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-video-appears-to-show-state-sen-mastriano-closer-to-capitol-riot-than-he-said/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">present on the Capitol lawn on Jan. 6</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Mastriano wins the primary and then the general election, it could have a profound effect on U.S. democracy. In Pennsylvania, the governor appoints the secretary of state, who administers elections in the state, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/12/an-openly-pro-coup-trumpist-could-become-pennsylvanias-next-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs off on the certification of the state’s electors</a>. Given that Mastriano has previously <a href="https://twitter.com/senmastriano/status/1332666825490968578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> the state legislature appointing electors in defiance of the state popular vote, a Gov. Mastriano could very well lead to the overturning of a free and fair election in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These extreme positions <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/doug-mastriano-pennsylvania-republican-goverrnor-race-20220429.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have GOP officials terrified</a> that Mastriano would lose this November to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the presumptive Democratic nominee. (For his part, Shapiro has actually <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/josh-shapiro-tv-ad-doug-mastriano-20220505.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired ads</a> that could <em>help</em> Mastriano win the GOP nomination, probably for this very reason.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Representatives from the other Republican campaigns have reportedly <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-republican-governor-doug-mastriano-election-20220510.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed a coordinated effort</a> against Mastriano, but the problem is agreeing on who is the best candidate to stop him. <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/lou-barletta-republican-primary-pennsylvania-governor-fundraising-20220208.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Former Rep. Lou Barletta</a> is second in many polls, but he shares some of Mastriano’s baggage (he was one of Pennsylvania’s “<a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/trumps-fake-electors-heres-the-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake electors</a>,” 20 people who signed fake documents saying Trump had won the state and sent them to the National Archives). <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/bill-mcswain-us-attorney-2022-pa-governor-race-20220316.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Former U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain</a> is the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pennsylvania-primary-election-2022-governors-race-campaign-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best-funded</a>, but Trump has explicitly <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/04/12/donald-trump-bill-mcswain-for-governor-2022-pennsylvania-endorsement-attack-statement/stories/202204120096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-endorsed him</a> for not doing enough to overturn the election. And <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-white-republican-primary-governor-2022-delaware-county-20220427.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Delaware County Councilman Dave White</a> looks like a viable contender in <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TRF-PA-GOP-Gov-Primary-0508-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some polls</a> but <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOQISg8HPNhtCK72dKVoGbHB3oMeoRRs/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not in others</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two candidates, state Senate President Jake Corman and former Rep. Melissa Hart, did <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/corman-ends-gop-governor-bid-endorses-barletta-in-effort-to-halt-mastriano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop out</a> and <a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/melissa-hart-lou-barletta-pennsylvania-governor-campaign/39991566#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorse Barletta</a>, but they were each polling in the single digits, so their support is unlikely to make much of a dent in Mastriano’s lead. The only thing that probably could have meaningfully shifted the race would have been if Trump endorsed one of the Mastriano alternatives. But on Saturday, as he often does, he went his own way: He <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/05/trump-weighs-in-on-pas-governors-race-and-make-his-pick-known.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Mastriano</a>, specifically citing how he “revealed the Deceit, Corruption, and outright Theft of the 2020 Presidential Election, and will do something about it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pennsylvania Republicans will also choose their nominees for three congressional districts they hope to flip from blue to red this November. In the <strong>7th District</strong>, former Lehigh County Commissioner Lisa Scheller came within 4 points of beating Democratic Rep. Susan Wild in 2020, and the seat got redder in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a> (it now has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+4). So Scheller is back this year with the <a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/elections/mc-nws-lisa-scheller-congress-pennsylvania-campaign-20220506-vgcittojtjhvnpv75pbsgmejni-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support of House Republican leadership</a>, but she’ll first have to get through business owner Kevin Dellicker in the primary. Scheller appears in good shape, though, having outraised Dellicker <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0PA07132/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.0 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA07096/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$183,321</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Northeastern Pennsylvania’s <strong>8th District</strong> (an<strong> </strong>R+8 partisan lean), Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright’s 2020 opponent, former Trump administration official Jim Bognet (who also lost by about 4 points), is back for a rematch as well. But Bognet lost in 2020, despite that Trump <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/trump-district-democrats-could-become-extinct-in-the-house-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried the district</a>, which is probably due mostly to Cartwright’s strength but also suggests the GOP could use a better candidate. Former Hazleton Mayor Mike Marsicano is also running in the primary, and Bognet has only outraised him <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0PA08221/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$719,516</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6PA11073/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$525,100</a>. However, Bognet’s support for Trump’s lawsuits over the 2020 election could save his bacon; he recently secured <a href="https://www.poconorecord.com/story/news/politics/elections/local/2022/05/05/trump-backs-bognet-in-northeast-pennsylvania-congressional-primary/65353737007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the <strong>17th District</strong> has a partisan lean of D+1, but the retirement of Rep. Conor Lamb has given the GOP an opening in this suburban Pittsburgh seat. Former Ross Township Commissioner Jeremy Shaffer <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-05-05/abortion-debate-animates-race-between-gop-congressional-candidates-in-17th-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks like the front-runner</a>, having raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17160/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$729,063</a>, and he is also likely the candidate with the most general-election appeal (he says he probably would have voted for President Biden’s infrastructure bill). National security consultant Jason Killmeyer has positioned himself as the more conservative option, but he has raised only <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17152/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$135,220</a>. A third candidate, former Bellevue Councilwoman Kathleen Coder, has raised just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2PA17186/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9,775</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Idaho</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 2nd Congressional District, governor, attorney general, secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, 11 p.m. Eastern in the Panhandle</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Idaho, governors and lieutenant governors don’t run on the same ticket, which has led to the <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/05/09/2022-idaho-primary-election-republican-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unusual situation</a> of Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin running for <strong>governor</strong> against her boss, incumbent Gov. Brad Little. Little has impeccable pro-Trump credentials (he <a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2020/12/11/gov-little-joins-with-idaho-gop-in-supporting-texas-lawsuit-on-election-integrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported Texas’s lawsuit</a> to invalidate the 2020 election results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), but the former president is nevertheless <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/trump-endorses-mcgeachin/277-b6db1f08-a46f-4977-ba0a-ab60478336b6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting McGeachin</a>, who is even further to the right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McGeachin supports a <a href="https://idahonews.com/news/local/idaho-lt-gov-mcgeachin-wants-50-state-election-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50-state audit</a> of the 2020 election and has <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/03/02/mcgeachin-asked-a-boise-rabbi-to-join-an-antisemitism-task-force-the-same-day-she-spoke-at-afpac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered a recorded message to a conference</a> hosted by white nationalists. She is probably most famous, though, for her vehement opposition to mask and vaccine mandates: Twice, while serving as acting governor when Little was traveling out of state, she has issued <a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/news/2021-05-27/mcgeachin-signs-executive-order-banning-mask-mandates-with-little-out-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive orders</a> <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/idaho-lt-gov-janice-mcgeachin-vaccine-passport-order-covid-19/277-38c2fcb5-814b-4d33-ac7a-d9c6575cfe64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning such mandates</a>, only to see Little <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/capitol-watch/idaho-mask-mandate-ban-executive-order-repealed-governor-brad-little-abuse-of-power/277-20e89731-2e23-4984-9db3-41331403c881" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quickly</a> <a href="https://www.kivitv.com/news/political/inside-the-statehouse/idaho-governor-repeals-political-rivals-executive-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rescind</a> them, calling McGeachin’s behavior “an irresponsible, self-serving political stunt.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if one of Trump’s other endorsees hasn’t already lost by this point in the evening, Idaho will probably snap his winning streak. According to a <a href="https://idahodispatch.com/2022poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted last month</a> by Zoldak Research for the Idaho Dispatch, Little led McGeachin by a whopping 60 percent to 29 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few other, more moderate Republican incumbents are also facing renomination threats from anti-democratic challengers. In Idaho’s <strong>2nd District</strong>, Rep. Mike Simpson is facing a rematch from lawyer Bryan Smith, whom he beat in 2014, 62 percent to 38 percent. While Simpson voted to certify the 2020 election results, Smith believes it was fraudulent. Outside groups have spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=ID02&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1.3 million</a> on Simpson’s behalf, which should help shore up his position but also suggests they see Smith as a serious threat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lawrence Wasden, the longest-serving <strong>attorney general</strong> in Idaho history, is also in danger of losing his bid for a sixth term to former <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/15/raul-labrador-profile-tea-party-congress-2018-218822/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tea-party</a> Republican Rep. Raúl Labrador. Labrador has outraised Wasden, <a href="https://sunshine.sos.idaho.gov/?offices%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=62&amp;parties%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=Republican&amp;contest_years%5B0%5D=2022&amp;contest_years%5B1%5D=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$592,449 to $478,294</a>,<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday at 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> and has translated that financial advantage into a 9-point lead in the <a href="https://idahodispatch.com/new-poll-says-raul-labrador-leading-ag-race-by-9-points-with-16-undecided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest poll</a>, conducted in early May by Remington Research Group. While Wasden was one of the few Republican attorneys general <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/national-politics/idaho-attorney-general-wont-join-texas-election-lawsuit/277-869896d7-351c-4e09-a30e-1f8416334119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to join the Texas lawsuit</a>, Labrador said <a href="https://magicvalley.com/opinion/columnists/malloy-labrador-seeks-to-take-activist-role-as-ag/article_78248bd1-9796-5737-850f-862588a1bb88.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would have</a> if he’d held the office.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, with the retirement of <a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2021/09/29/idaho-secretary-state-refutes-mike-lindells-statewide-manipulation-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-democracy</a> incumbent Lawerence Denney, there’s a very real possibility that an election denier will become Idaho’s next <strong>secretary of state</strong>. Two of the three candidates, state Rep. Dorothy Moon and state Sen. Mary Souza, have said that Biden <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/04/26/two-of-three-idaho-gop-secretary-of-state-candidates-deny-biden-won-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not fairly win the 2020 election</a>. However, both have been <a href="https://sunshine.sos.idaho.gov/?offices%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=59&amp;parties%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=Republican&amp;contest_years%5B0%5D=2022&amp;contest_years%5B1%5D=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outraised</a> by Ada County Clerk Phil McGrane, who runs elections in Idaho’s most populous county and has accepted Biden’s win, so it’s possible that a pro-democracy Republican still ends up holding this office.</p>



<h2><strong>Oregon</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 5th and 6th congressional districts, governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern in the Mountain time zone part of Malheur County, 11 p.m. Eastern in the rest of the state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Oregon is a fairly blue state, but two factors could conspire to give Republicans an opening there in November: the Republican-leaning <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national environment</a> and outgoing Democratic Gov. Kate Brown’s <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/05/new-poll-finds-kate-brown-is-nations-least-popular-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopularity</a>. Perhaps sensing an opening, 19 candidates are running in the GOP primary for <strong>governor</strong>, but none has exactly taken the state by storm: According to <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21866126/oregon-gop-primary-topline-survey-results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nelson Research</a>, “undecided” leads with 27 percent, followed by former state House Minority Leader Christine Drazan with 19 percent, former Oregon GOP Chair Bob Tiernan with 14 percent, 2016 GOP gubernatorial nominee Bud Pierce with 10 percent and Sandy Mayor Stan Pulliam with 7 percent. Most of the major candidates are <a href="https://www.pdxmonthly.com/news-and-city-life/2022/04/oregon-governors-race-tv-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional conservatives</a>, but Pulliam has tossed voters <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/05/09/trump-oregon-politics-governors-race-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more pro-Trump red meat</a> (“I’m the only conservative candidate, especially on this stage, that is willing to say the truth,” he said at an April debate: “The 2020 election was fraudulent, completely fraudulent”).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also contested Republican primaries for two congressional seats that the GOP is hoping to flip this year, but perhaps unsurprisingly given both districts’ slightly Democratic lean, these primaries aren’t really shaping up as referendums on Trump, either. For instance, none of the five candidates who responded to a <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/04/leading-oregon-republican-candidates-for-congress-say-biden-was-in-fact-winner-of-2020-presidential-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questionnaire by The Oregonian/OregonLive</a> said that the 2020 election was illegitimate. In the <strong>5th District</strong>, which has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+3, five Republicans are competing to be the nominee. Former Happy Valley Mayor Lori Chavez-DeRemer (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR05209/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$669,145</a>, including almost $300,000 in self-funding) and energy investor Jimmy Crumpacker (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0OR02168/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$541,208</a>) have raised the most money. If elected in November, Chavez-DeRemer would be the first Hispanic person Oregon sends to the U.S. Congress — she has already <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/elise-stefanik-unveils-endorsements-2022-midterm-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned the support</a> of New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is on a mission to get more female Republicans elected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With a partisan lean of D+7, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand-new</a> <strong>6th District</strong> is tougher terrain for the GOP, but Republicans could probably flip it if they nominate the right candidate. Logistics executive Mike Erickson leads the seven-candidate Republican field in fundraising with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OR06124/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$722,688</a>, and his ability to self-fund could also come in handy in November. However, energy executive Nathan Sandvig (whose hero is <a href="https://katu.com/news/know-your-candidates/nathan-sandvig-r-running-for-congress-district-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Dwight Eisenhower</a>) and state Rep. Ron Noble (whose state House district voted for Biden), both of whom are <a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/19/oregon-7-candidates-in-6th-congressional-district-republican-primary/65351031007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasizing how centrist they are</a>, could also be formidable nominees. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">After about a three-year hiatus, FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-every-senator-ranks-according-to-popularity-above-replacement-senator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popularity Above Replacement Senator</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-the-popularity-above-replacement-governor-rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popularity Above Replacement Governor</a> ratings are back! Based on Morning Consult’s approval ratings<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> for every <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/25/joe-manchins-approach-paying-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">senator</a> and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/28/governor-approval-ratings-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor</a> in the country (now updated for the first quarter of 2022), PARS and PARG attempt to measure how much stronger (or weaker) a politician is than a generic (or, to use a term from baseball, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/wins-above-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replacement-level</a>) candidate from their party would be. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea behind these stats is that a 70 percent approval rating for a Democrat in Massachusetts isn’t the same as a 70 percent approval rating for a Democrat in Florida. Because Massachusetts is so blue, that’s no big whoop in the Bay State — but in reddish Florida, it denotes a talented politician with a lot of cross-party appeal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Calculating PARS and PARG is simple: It’s just the difference between each state’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> and the senator or governor’s net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating). Doing this for the Senate, we get the following table of senators with the best and worst statewide brands:</p>

 <p>Independent Sens. Angus King and Bernie Sanders are considered Democrats for the purposes of these calculations. Bolded rows denote senators running for reelection in 2022.</p>
 <p>FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nationally, Sen. Joe Manchin is best known as a thorn in liberals’ side because he has opposed President Biden’s agenda on the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/12/19/joe-manchin-kills-the-build-back-better-act-joe-bidens-ambitious-legislative-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social safety net</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-brace-for-likely-defeat-of-voting-rights-push-due-to-gop-filibuster/2022/01/19/2f9a734c-792d-11ec-bf97-6eac6f77fba2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting rights</a>, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/05/joe-manchin-vote-against-codify-roe-wade-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion</a> and more. But his moderation has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endeared him to voters</a> in his home state of West Virginia: He has a +22 net approval rating in the R+36 state, for a chamber-leading PARS of +58. And he’s not the only Democrat with a lot of cross-party appeal; in fact, the 16 senators with the highest PARS scores all caucus with the Democratic Party. This includes Sens. Jon Tester (+33 PARS) and Sherrod Brown (+20 PARS), who have managed to win multiple elections despite hailing from red states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This also offers a glimmer of hope to Democrats who face the very real prospect of losing control of the Senate in 2022, as this fall’s midterm elections are shaping up well for Republicans. Their four most vulnerable incumbents this fall — Sens. Raphael Warnock, Mark Kelly, Maggie Hassan and Catherine Cortez Masto — all have PARS scores of at least +7, suggesting that they are capable of outperforming the base partisanship of their state. That will be essential in a year when, based solely on partisan lean and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot polling</a>, you’d expect a Republican to win their home states, all else being equal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the flip side, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has one of the worst PARS scores (-18); despite his home state of Wisconsin having an R+4 partisan lean, his net approval rating is -14 percentage points. This <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/19/ron-johnson-reelection-campaign-wisconsin-00026142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopularity</a> could drag him down in November, allowing Democrats to flip a Senate seat that, on paper, should remain Republican in this environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, a senator’s PARS score isn’t everything. Just ask Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who for years has had the worst PARS score in the country (currently -54). Yet, even though his net approval rating has long been underwater, he easily won reelection in 2020 thanks to Kentucky’s overwhelming Republican lean. (That said, he did win by “only” 20 points, several points worse than the state’s partisan lean, suggesting that his unpopularity did have <em>some</em> effect.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Senators like Manchin and McConnell are exceptions, though. The majority of senators have PARS scores in the single digits, indicating that their approval rating is largely determined by the partisanship of their states. This is less true for governors, however. Although partisanship has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-politics-is-presidential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting more important</a> in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gubernatorial races</a>, it is not as dominant of a force in them as it is in federal elections.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correlation between senatorial approval rating and partisan lean is 0.44; the correlation between gubernatorial approval rating and partisan lean is -0.11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, more governors than senators have PARGs at the extreme ends of the spectrum, as you can see in the table below. Also, a mix of both parties dominates the top of the list — not just Democrats. </p>

This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-popularity-above-replacement-governor-rankings-are-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As they have for years</a>, three northeastern, blue-state Republicans lead the way: Govs. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Phil Scott of Vermont and Larry Hogan of Maryland. Each currently enjoys an extraordinary PARG of +75 or higher. A trio of red-state Democrats — Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Kansas’s Laura Kelly and Louisiana’s John Bel Edwards — all have PARGs between +31 and +51 as well. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similar to a senator’s PARS score, a governor’s PARG score can also help us get a better sense of which governors running for reelection in 2022 are best equipped to swim against the partisan tide of their states. Scott and Kelly<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker, Hogan, Beshear and Edwards aren’t on the ballot this year; Baker and Hogan are retiring, while Kentucky and Louisiana elect their governors in odd years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> seem to be in the best position, especially Scott: Not only does he have more cross-party appeal than Kelly (+77 PARG), but he is also a Republican running in a good Republican year. Kelly, on the other hand, does have a brand distinct from the national Democratic Party, but it’s an open question whether she can get enough Kansas Republicans who approve of her to take the extra step and vote for her as well. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early polling</a> indicates a tight race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Governors running for reelection in swing states also have some very different PARGs that explain why some of them are vulnerable this year, while others probably don’t have anything to worry about. For instance, New Hampshire is an evenly divided state, but Gov. Chris Sununu’s net approval rating is +30, so he is expected to comfortably win reelection. And you might expect Democratic Gov. Jared Polis to be vulnerable in a Republican-leaning midterm in D+6 Colorado, but his net approval rating is 16 points higher than that, giving him a nice cushion in case the national environment puts his state in play.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With a PARG of +13, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak of Nevada also has a distinct personal brand that could help him weather a tough reelection campaign in purple Nevada. But Democratic Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin may be more at the mercy of the national mood. Evers’s PARG is just +1, suggesting perceptions of him are strongly dependent on partisanship. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan is somewhere in the middle, with a PARG of +6. That suggests she has a <em>bit</em> of crossover appeal, but that her fate is still closely tied to partisanship.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Toward the bottom of the list are five governors running for reelection whose approval ratings don’t look as strong as they seem after taking partisan lean into account. That said, they are all in very safe states, so they shouldn’t be in any danger. The governor’s race in Rhode Island could be a sleeper, though, considering Gov. Dan McKee’s mediocre +2 net approval rating, the fact that he is running for the office for the first time (he <a href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/dan-mckee-takes-oath-of-office-to-become-governor-of-rhode-island" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became governor</a> only because he was the lieutenant governor when the old governor resigned), the pro-Republican national mood and Rhode Island’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elasticity</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the two governors with the worst PARGs are Democrats Kate Brown of Oregon (-25) and David Ige of Hawaii (-41). Both have negative net approval ratings despite governing fairly blue states. They might have been in real danger of losing their seats in 2022, but thankfully for Democrats, both are retiring.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A new <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_051122/">Monmouth University poll</a>, conducted May 5-9 after a draft Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, found that only 38 percent of Americans approved of the job the Supreme Court was doing, while 52 percent disapproved. This was significantly worse than the court’s ratings in March, when 42 percent approved and 42 percent disapproved. But it is also arguably the continuation of a long-term decline in the court’s popularity; a Monmouth poll from March 2016 gave the court a 49 percent approval and 33 percent disapproval rating.</li><li>With the prospect that abortion could soon be illegal in many states, some people may face difficult decisions about what to do if they have an unwanted pregnancy. According to a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/10/abortion-roe-illegal-poll">May 5-8 poll</a> from the Generation Lab, which researches trends among young people, 56 percent of 18- to 29-year-old women said that they would still seek out an abortion provider even if it were illegal. An additional 10 percent said they would attempt to end the pregnancy at home. Only 34 percent said they would carry the pregnancy to term.</li><li>As hate crimes against Asian Americans have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-339-percent-nationwide-last-year-repo-rcna14282">increased amid the coronavirus pandemic</a>, 72 percent of English-speaking Asian Americans told the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/05/09/about-a-third-of-asian-americans-say-they-have-changed-their-daily-routine-due-to-concerns-over-threats-attacks/?utm_content=buffer5cba9&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Pew Research Center</a> that they at least sometimes worry about getting threatened or attacked because of their race or ethnicity, including 21 percent who said they worry about it every day or almost every day. More than a third — 36 percent — also said they have changed their daily routines because of that worry.</li><li>Billionaire Elon Musk’s quest to buy Twitter isn’t yet official, but if he is successful, he said this week he will <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61399483">reinstate former President Donald Trump’s account</a>. But according to a <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/05/03132947/2204195_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> from April 29-May 2, that would be a controversial decision: 45 percent of registered voters thought Trump’s ban from Twitter should be kept permanent, while 41 percent agreed with restoring his account.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Since January 2021, 11 states have enacted laws limiting how teachers can talk about race and racism in schools, and close to 200 bills have been introduced in 40 states. What are these laws actually doing? What is their impact in the classroom and at the ballot box? And why has this issue become such a focus in our politics?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Galen Druke discusses these questions with Theodore R. Johnson, the director of the Fellows Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2016, North Carolina <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtq-rights-fight-reignited-4-years-after-n-c-s-n1250390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed its infamous “bathroom bill”</a>, which prevented transgender people from using public bathrooms that aligned with their gender identity. Today, anti-trans legislation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/23/anti-trans-bills-us-transgender-youth-sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is taking aim at children</a>. Dozens of states have introduced bills limiting transgender students’ participation on school sports teams that match their gender identity. <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/32117426/state-policies-transgender-athlete-participation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thirteen states</a>, all Republican-leaning, have passed such bills in the last two years, turning an issue that affects <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/age-trans-individuals-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 1 percent</a> of the country’s youth into the latest battle in the culture wars.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the current push to restrict trans rights goes beyond athletics — Republicans are also increasingly pushing to restrict trans rights in the classroom.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using data from <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American Civil Liberties Union</a>, <a href="https://freedomforallamericans.org/legislative-tracker/anti-transgender-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom for All Americans</a> and the Human Rights Campaign,<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bills were shared with me via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a> as well as additional bills found in the course of my research, I identified 40 bills introduced since January 2021 that seek to restrict how gender and gender identity are taught at schools. Bills ranged from requiring parental consent or notification before teaching these subjects to limiting these topics for students in certain grades to outright prohibiting learning about gender identity.<a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We limited these bills to only those that specifically mentioned gender or gender identity; bills that sought to restrict teaching related to sexuality or sexual orientation were excluded from this tally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a> Other bills prevent students from using different names and pronouns without parental consent or remove antidiscrimination guidelines.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, underscoring just how closely this movement is linked to the push around banning critical race theory — an academic <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal framework</a> that asserts that racism is systemic and embedded in many American institutions — in the classroom, 13 of these bills also included language restricting how schools can teach about race and racism. Several bills targeted critical race theory directly, despite the fact that critical race theory is not taught in K-12 schools.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Reading the text of these bills is like a Cliffs Notes summary of all the ways in which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-education-became-todays-wedge-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education has become a wedge issue</a>. Of the 13 bills that limit both how gender and gender identity and race and racism are talked about in the classroom, three proposed bills — in <a href="https://legiscan.com/RI/bill/H7539/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhode Island</a>,<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. 7539&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="https://legiscan.com/SC/bill/H4799/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Carolina</a><a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. 4799&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>33</sup></a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/WV/text/HB4016/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Virginia</a><a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AB 4016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> — explicitly ban schools from teaching The New York Times’s 1619 Project, which has long been <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/lawmakers-push-to-ban-1619-project-from-schools/2021/02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a target of right-wing attacks in schools</a>. There is also an <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/bill/SB1654/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma</a> bill<a data-footnote-id="35" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-35" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SB 1654&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>35</sup></a> that proposes to ban books in public school libraries “that make as their primary subject the study of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender issues.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These fights of what can — and can’t — be taught in schools aren’t new. “Schools have been a site of many political battles and many political interventions,” said Adrienne Dixson, a professor of education at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, citing the historical examples of Brown v. Board of Education (a landmark Supreme Court case that banned racial segregation in public schools) and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1980/08/10/the-battle-of-bilingual-education/9a7cc4e1-f779-42d8-ae95-31c1aae23329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal battles over providing bilingual education</a>. And as FiveThirtyEight’s Alex Samuels and Kaleigh Rogers explained last year, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservatives have long used schools as a battleground for culture war issues</a> over everything from evolution to sex education to racial equality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conservatives’ attacks on schools <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/trump-blasts-left-wing-indoctrination-in-history-classes-as-child-abuse/2020/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ratcheted up during the Trump administration</a>. Following the murder of George Floyd and protests for racial justice in the summer of 2020, then-President Donald Trump tried to control how the federal government talked about issues of race, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/9/24/21451220/critical-race-theory-diversity-training-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning federal agencies and contractors</a> from conducting racial sensitivity training in an executive order <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-race-sex-stereotyping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued in September 2020</a>. The federal government <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/could-president-trump-really-penalize-schools-for-teaching-the-1619-project/2020/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t actually dictate what’s taught in public schools, but Trump also threatened</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/06/politics/trump-education-department-1619-project/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pull funding</a> from some schools that used the 1619 Project in its curriculum.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Trump ultimately wasn’t able to ban what was taught in schools, the rhetoric in his executive order was significant in that it helped “legitimize the discontent that his base had, and has probably had for a while as it relates to racial equity,” according to Dixson. Moreover, the language in his <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/28/2020-21534/combating-race-and-sex-stereotyping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive order</a> has cropped up repeatedly in the anti-trans bills I’ve studied.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, many of these bills are part of a coordinated legislative effort. Oakley told me that Promise to America’s Children, an anti-LGBTQ coalition, was the source of many of these anti-trans bills. And one of the organizations <a href="https://familypolicyalliance.com/press-releases/introducing-the-promise-to-americas-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behind Promise to America’s Children</a>, the Heritage Foundation, <a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/impact/states-use-heritages-model-legislation-reject-critical-race-theory-classrooms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has created model legislation</a> opposing the “tenets” of critical race theory being taught in K-12 classrooms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As of March 15, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/nearly-240-anti-lgbtq-bills-filed-2022-far-targeting-trans-people-rcna20418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">154 anti-trans bills</a> that limit access to health care, sports, bathrooms and education have been introduced in state legislatures across the country, according to NBC News. This is already more than the 153 such bills introduced in 2021. More broadly, the number of anti-LGBTQ bills has also grown from 41 in 2018 to 238 in just the first few months of 2022. (Some states with Democratic-controlled legislatures are fighting back. Connecticut, for instance, became the first state to respond to this sort of legislative action this week with <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2022/TOB/H/PDF/2022HB-05506-R00-HB.PDF#page=270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bill containing a pro-trans provision</a>, proposing a “safe-state law” that would guarantee protections for transgender individuals leaving other states.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans are using tools beyond legislation to attack trans rights. In February, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott instructed the state’s Department of Family and Protective Services to <a href="https://abc13.com/gender-affirming-care-texas-transgender-youth-investigate-as-child-abuse-trans-rights-in/11597436/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigate reports of gender-affirming health care</a> for trans children as child abuse — a move that left many parents of trans children in Texas feeling “frantic,” according to Emma, the mother of an eight-year-old trans girl from Austin. (Emma preferred to use a pseudonym out of privacy concerns.) “I go between feeling a rage and just sheer panic,” she said, adding that she knows six families who are leaving the state over this.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Only one of these bills, Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Act,<a data-footnote-id="36" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-36" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, FiveThirtyEight’s parent company, has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/04/01/disney-dont-say-gay-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;opposed this law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>36</sup></a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-governor-signs-controversial-dont-gay-bill-law/story?id=83719304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been signed into law so far</a>. But even if many of these bills aren’t passed, they can still create an atmosphere that is hostile to trans people. Often, too, it falls to trans kids to fight back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One student who knows this particularly well is 18-year-old Amira Pierotti, a senior at James Madison Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin, who helped rewrite their local health education curricula twice to make it more LGBTQ-inclusive — Pierotti said the original curriculum had “no LGBT+ representation, nothing on safe sex, nothing on consent, very little on sexual assault.” For the last two years, they say they’ve also been involved  in a lawsuit <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/wisconsin-supreme-court-agrees-to-review-suit-against-mmsd-over-transgender-student-preferred-name-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought on by a local conservative advocacy group</a> over whether staff can call students by different names or pronouns, without parental consent. (Several student clubs at local high schools, including one where Pierotti is a member, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/doe-v-madison-metropolitan-school-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intervened as defendants</a> in the lawsuit.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just this lawsuit, either — Pierotti also helped organize against <a href="https://www.wpr.org/republican-bill-would-require-schools-notify-parents-teaching-programs-sexual-orientation-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bill introduced by Wisconsin Republicans last September</a> that would have required schools to give parents notice before providing any instruction related to sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. One of Pierotti’s friends, Cameron Craig, a 16-year-old sophomore, stayed up the night before and skipped school the next day to testify against the bill. Craig told me that they were motivated to do this because it was important to them that legislators understand what their experience of being a trans student was like.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://legiscan.com/WI/bill/AB562/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The bill ultimately failed</a>, but at that point, <a href="https://legiscan.com/WI/bill/AB963/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a similar bill had already passed</a> both chambers of the Wisconsin legislature. <a href="https://www.wpr.org/evers-vetoes-gop-bills-mps-voucher-schools-parental-bill-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">And while that bill was later vetoed</a> by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, when trans rights at school are up for debate, “it’s an invitation toward discrimination,” said Stephen Russell, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the health and well-being of LGBTQ+ adolescents. For some trans kids, the difference between a supportive and an unsupportive school environment can be a matter of life or death. According to my analysis of data from <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2021/?section=AffirmingSpaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a late 2020 poll from the advocacy group The Trevor Project</a>, trans and nonbinary youth who felt that their school was not a gender-affirming space were almost 30 percent more likely to have attempted suicide in the last year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Craig, the loss of school as a potential safe outlet for self-expression especially makes them concerned for friends who are closeted at home because they don’t have a supportive family. “School is their safe space right now, where we can be kind of openly LGBTQ a good amount of the time,” said Craig. “[T]hat being taken away from them would be really, absolutely devastating.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But with the number of anti-trans bills growing, school might not be a safe space for trans kids anytime soon.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Former President Donald Trump’s perfect 2022 endorsement record is no more. After all 36 Senate, House or governor candidates he endorsed in Texas, Indiana and Ohio won their primaries, Trump-supported businessman Charles Herbster lost his bid for Nebraska governor last night.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The winner of the Republican primary was instead University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, who took <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nebraska-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=84596290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33 percent of the vote</a>. Herbster finished second, with 30 percent, followed closely by moderate state Sen. Brett Lindstrom with 26 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race had been seen as a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-west-virginia-and-nebraska-primaries-will-be-the-latest-test-for-trumps-endorsement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proxy war</a> between Trump and the establishment and moderate wings of the GOP. And thanks to Pillen’s win, the next governor of Nebraska will likely<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming he beats Democratic state Sen. Carol Blood in the fall, which he is &lt;a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heavily favored&lt;/a&gt; to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>27</sup></a> be someone with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/02/trump-pete-herbster-charles-ricketts-nebraska-518392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep ties</a> to the state’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/18/nebraska-republican-candidates-trump-482703" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political and economic establishment</a> who has <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/the-top-four-republican-candidates-for-nebraska-governor-agree-biden-is-president/article_be2bfe00-aa33-11ec-aa07-9bac59c6bcf1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepted President Biden’s election</a>, rather than someone who <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/03/24/herbster-goes-off-script-in-gov-debate-lindstrom-stays-on-thibodeau-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believes that China orchestrated the coronavirus pandemic</a> and spent Jan. 6, 2021, <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/02/25/herbster-was-schmoozing-with-trump-team-jan-5-6-as-they-detailed-plans-to-overturn-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the Trump war room</a>. Along with incumbent Secretary of State Bob Evnen’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/10/us/elections/results-nebraska-secretary-of-state.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">win</a>, it now seems that the 2024 presidential election in Nebraska is set to be certified by two men who <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/02/06/nebraska-secretary-of-state-pushes-back-against-claims-that-2020-vote-was-amiss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respect the democratic process</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the same time, this loss isn’t evidence that Trump’s influence with the Republican base is slipping. Herbster was far from a perfect candidate — most notably, eight women accused him of <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/14/gop-state-senator-seven-other-women-say-charles-herbster-groped-them-he-denies-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwanted sexual advances</a>, including groping and forcible kissing. Retiring Gov. Pete Ricketts also <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/trump-endorses-herbster-for-nebraska-governor-ricketts-disagrees/article_72146196-36b2-11ec-b976-f38f813df474.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked Herbster</a> for allegedly moving his agricultural company out of state and supporting higher taxes, and he <a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/ricketts-endorses-regent-jim-pillen-in-governors-race/article_61ec366b-e5cd-5767-aefd-ad6a6995ddbf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw his full weight</a> behind Pillen (a lesson, perhaps, to other GOP elites that they have influence too, when they choose to wield it). Ultimately, Trump’s endorsement wasn’t powerful enough to drag Herbster to victory, but his endorsement remains an asset in any Republican primary. Just ask Rep. Alex Mooney, who decisively won his primary last night in West Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elimination of one of West Virginia’s House seats</a> after the 2020 census <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw Mooney into the same district</a> as fellow Republican Rep. David McKinley, and Mooney represented only <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-6-house-races-where-incumbents-are-likely-to-face-another-incumbent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">34 percent of the new district</a>, to McKinley’s 66 percent. But with Trump’s endorsement, Mooney romped to a victory, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/west-virginia-2002-primary-election-results/story?id=84596244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent to 36 percent</a>. As a result, there will now be one fewer pro-democracy Republican in the House (McKinley voted to <a href="https://mckinley.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certify the 2020 election</a> and <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/05/19/us-house-approves-jan-6-commission-mckinley-one-of-35-republican-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigate the Jan. 6 attack</a>) and one fewer consensus-builder as well (McKinley was rated as one of the <a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=20abfc4c-e01c-49d2-8a26-5d420d4918fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most bipartisan House members</a> and helped pass <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/11/12/mckinley-mooney-square-off-on-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s infrastructure bill</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, Trump’s endorsed candidates for Senate, House and governor have now won 39 out of their 40 Republican primaries so far in 2022.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Herbster and Mooney, Trump also endorsed West Virginia Rep. Carol Miller and Nebraska Rep. Adrian Smith, who &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/west-virginia-2002-primary-election-results/story?id=84596244" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cruised&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nebraska-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=84596290es.com/interactive/2022/05/10/us/elections/results-nebraska-us-house-district-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;renomination&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>28</sup></a> That statistic, of course, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far overstates his impact</a>: 33 of those 40 endorsements were incumbents facing only token opposition. But that means that, even in relatively uncertain primaries, his picks have still gone 6-for-7. That includes impressive wins by Mooney, who was fighting the geography of his district, as well as author J.D. Vance, who had been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-primary-for-ohio-senate-will-be-a-test-for-trump-but-probably-a-win-for-trumpism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">languishing at around 10 percent in the polls</a> before Trump’s endorsement helped him surge in Ohio’s GOP Senate primary last week.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are still months of primaries yet to be held, so we’ll have to wait and see what Trump’s final track record is before drawing any firm conclusions. But right now, Trump has an impressive 86 percent win rate in incumbent-less primaries. It’s a testament to his <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued popularity within the party</a> — although he clearly isn’t invincible.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/chadwick-matlin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chadwick Matlin</a>, deputy editor)<strong>:</strong> Are we sure that redistricting maps aren’t being drawn by the boy who cried wolf? Following the news around gerrymandering over the past few months has felt like one bait and switch after the other. First you hear about a new map in Alabama, then you hear <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/01/25/federal-court-throws-out-alabamas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a federal court has struck it down</a> for violating racial gerrymandering laws … and then the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/07/1078292766/supreme-court-lets-alabama-use-gop-backed-map-of-the-states-congressional-distri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lets it stand</a>. Next you hear that New York has achieved the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorks-proposed-congressional-map-is-heavily-biased-toward-democrats-will-it-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platonic ideal of a partisan gerrymander</a> … and then weeks later the map <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is struck down by the state’s highest court</a>. And after that … well, it’s easy to lose track of where all these maps stand, and what all these legal interjections mean for the future of <s>gerrymandering</s> redistricting going forward.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To discuss this herky-jerk form of democracy we’re all living through, I’ve asked two colleagues who obsess about this stuff the most to join the chat. Nathaniel Rakich is a senior elections analyst who also administers our invaluable redistricting database. And senior writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux namedrops judicial precedents like they’re part of the vernacular.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nathaniel, Amelia, thanks for taking the time to reflect on this very odd redistricting season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst)<strong>:</strong> Thanks, Chad, for that ebullient introduction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/amelia-thomson-deveaux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</a>, senior writer)<strong>:</strong> I’m here, I have tea, I have chocolate. Let’s doooo ittttt.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> True blogger fuel, Amelia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before we get to the full compendium of lawsuits that I know Nathaniel has been hoarding, let’s start with your overall takeaways. Has this redistricting season gone as you expected it might? Have judges been more or less present in the way our political maps get made than you thought they’d be?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> It depends on when you measure from, Chad — which gets at how the courts have really upended redistricting this cycle. At the beginning of the cycle, I expected the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/redistricting-has-maintained-the-status-quo-so-far-thats-good-for-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning status quo</a> to largely prevail, based on the fact that Republicans were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-won-almost-every-election-where-redistricting-was-at-stake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in charge of drawing more districts</a> than Democrats were. But a couple months ago, I had to revise my expectations to say that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats would actually emerge as winners</a>, because courts had struck down Republican gerrymanders in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and Democrats were drawing their own gerrymanders with impunity. But then courts struck down two of those gerrymanders in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>, which made redistricting look like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more of a partisan wash</a>, so things are now turning out more like I expected at the beginning after all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Redistricting is a flat circle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Or some sort of polygon, anyway.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Is a circle a polygon?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> No! Polygons must have straight sides.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Do political districts have to be polygons??</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Haha, no, I guess not! Some follow river boundaries, for instance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>It’s interesting, because I think state courts were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-fight-over-partisan-gerrymandering-is-moving-beyond-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seen as a bigger threat to Republicans</a> — and yet as Nathaniel pointed out, they’ve turned out to be a hurdle for Democrats as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick: </strong>Nathaniel, can you remind us of just how many states’ maps ended up in court (or are still there)?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Almost every map that could reasonably be considered a gerrymander — and even <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/idaho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some that couldn’t</a> — has been sued over. By my count, 21 states’ congressional maps have been challenged in court. Six (in Alabama, Kansas, Maryland, New York, North Carolina and Ohio) were overturned, although Alabama’s was reinstated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>Were there any states that you expected to be sued over and weren’t? It seems like all of the partisan gerrymandering activity just shifted to the state courts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I think just <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennessee</a>? There, Republicans split Nashville between three districts, turning the 5th District from safely blue to safely red. Democrats in the state <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/briefs/crowd-protests-gop-drawn-congressional-maps-on-mlk-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cried bloody murder over it</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tndp/status/1489652663197253632" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised a lawsuit</a>, but it never materialized.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Huh, I wonder if they figured it was doomed in the Tennessee state courts. Given the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-supreme-court-punt-on-partisan-gerrymandering-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literal decades of handwringing</a> over the appropriate standard for determining an unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, it’s funny that state judges really don’t seem to have had much trouble with that question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes, that’s my guess, Amelia. One clear theme from this year’s state-level lawsuits about redistricting is that the partisanship of the judges who hear the case really matters. For instance, North Carolina’s Republican gerrymander only got overturned because Democrats hold a <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/state-supreme-court-strikes-down-n-c-election-maps-with-4-3-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4-3 majority</a> on the state Supreme Court. Republicans have a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/14/maureen-oconnor-republicans-gerrymander-elections-ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4-3 majority</a> on the Ohio Supreme Court, but one of those Republicans is a swing vote, and she sided with the court’s Democrats to overturn Ohio’s (Republican-drawn) map, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it hasn’t been an ironclad rule. Most notably, a New York Court of Appeals that was 100 percent appointed by Democratic governors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/nyregion/redistricting-congress-gerrymander-ny.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly voted to strike down</a> the state’s Democratic gerrymander. I think that took a lot of Democrats by surprise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> We’ve seen a general trend <a href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/4007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toward attempting to “pack” state courts</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/state-supreme-courts-are-the-next-frontier-in-politics-2022-elections-2022-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get voters more excited</a> about the results of state judicial elections. I wonder if cases like New York and Ohio will feed that trend. It wouldn’t be especially inspiring for the state of judicial independence, but there you go.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> When a majority of the Supreme Court ruled that it didn’t think partisan gerrymandering was something the highest court should rule on, is this fractured landscape of legal challenges what it had in mind?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>Chad, I think some of the justices <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were worried</a> about every gerrymander getting endlessly litigated in federal court, with judges struggling to figure out what the right calls are. So… yes? But that energy has basically shifted to state courts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Delegation is an important form of leadership!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Of course, that ruling didn’t take federal courts out of the redistricting game. For instance, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in February the Supreme Court ruled</a> that Alabama can use a House map that a lower court had ruled was likely discriminatory against Black voters. That’s not a partisan gerrymandering case, of course — it’s about what’s legal under <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act#:~:text=Section%202%20of%20the%20Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965%20prohibits,)(2)%20of%20the%20Act." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a>, which <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/does-anti-gerrymandering-campaign-threaten-minority-voting-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows courts to require</a> the creation of majority-minority districts in some situations. The goal of those districts is to give minority voters the ability to participate equally in the political process and elect representatives of their choosing. But it still signaled that the Roberts court is about to wade back into the fight over redistricting, and likely scale back the VRA <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/25/us/annotated-supreme-court-decision-on-voting-rights-act.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more than it already has</a>. So the federal courts have weighed in — just not on whether a partisan gerrymander was unconstitutional.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nathaniel, I have to confess, I was a little surprised by the Alabama ruling. It just seemed like such an open-and-shut VRA case. What was your reaction?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes, it is very possible to draw a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second predominantly Black seat</a> in Alabama, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the current interpretation of the VRA</a>, that should have made Alabama’s current map (which features just one predominantly Black seat) illegal. And that <em>is</em> what a lower-court panel initially said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> A lower-court panel that was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/07/1078292766/supreme-court-lets-alabama-use-gop-backed-map-of-the-states-congressional-distri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not especially lefty</a>, I might add! Two of the judges were Trump appointees.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> But then the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a375_d18f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put the map back in place</a>, citing the Purcell principle, or the idea that courts shouldn’t change election laws too close to an election. (I’m sure we’ll get back to Purcell in a minute.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the fact that the Supreme Court didn’t think the Alabama map was an obvious VRA violation suggested that they are setting themselves up to reinterpret/gut the VRA yet again. (The Alabama case is still pending before the court and should be handed down next year.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That part didn’t necessarily surprise me, though. This court has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-just-made-it-harder-to-fight-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very hostile to the VRA</a>. Plus, saying that Alabama had to draw a second Black seat would have essentially required Louisiana and other Southern states that have short-changed Black representation to add a Black seat too, which would be a real blow to Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>Yes, there have been signs that the conservative justices were gearing up to take aim at Section 2 of the VRA (the part that has to do with majority-minority districts). This is, of course, nearly ten years <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after the Roberts court gutted Section 5 of the VRA</a>, which allowed nine Southern states with histories of racial discrimination in voting to change their election laws without having to get permission from the federal government. Since then, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/effects-shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research has found</a> that those states have purged voters at higher rates and passed new laws restricting voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> And, regardless of how they present themselves, several justices seem pretty transparent in their desire for Republican governance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> On that note, Nathaniel, the court’s use of the Purcell principle was … interesting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> Can’t believe it hasn’t been renamed the Garland Principle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>In the Alabama case, <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/2022/2/16/22937235/supreme-court-alabama-congressional-map-purcell-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the justices said</a> that it was too close to the election to change the maps, which of course favored the Republicans. <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/03/justices-decline-to-reinstate-gop-backed-congressional-voting-maps-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They said the same thing</a> when it came to North Carolina’s map, which favored Democrats. All well and good, right? But then they threw out a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that adopted the Democratic governor’s legislative maps <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/15/wisconsin-supreme-court-adopts-legislative-maps-drawn-republicans/7250042001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only four months before the primaries</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong>: Yeah, the court didn’t cite Purcell in that case, even though they did in the Alabama case when there were <em>also</em> just four months to go until the primary! The Purcell principle is a convenient tool because it can be used to suit your desired ends. Did a court strike down a map you like? You can say it’s too close to the election to make a change and undo that decision. Did a court implement a map you don’t like? You can say there’s still time to fix it and undo that decision too. There’s no specific set time period that triggers Purcell.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd: </strong>And you might think that the North Carolina ruling was an uncharacteristically positive outcome for Democrats from this Supreme Court, but even though the short-term outcome was good for Democrats, that case could be <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article259191768.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very bad for them</a> in the long term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick: </strong>Why very bad in the long term?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> The Supreme Court ruled on the North Carolina map on its shadow docket, which meant that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/us/supreme-court-voting-maps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was an emergency application</a> without extensive briefing or oral argument. But the justices <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/07/supreme-court-rejects-gop-efforts-to-block-new-congressional-maps-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaled that they could take the case next term</a>. And if they do, they could end up ruling that state courts can’t change congressional maps that were drawn by state legislatures — which, given our earlier discussion about how active state courts have been this year, would be a big deal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes, this is known as the “independent state legislative doctrine.” Because the Constitution <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specifically says</a> that state legislatures are in charge of setting election law, some conservatives believe that no one else — not even state courts — can change it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick:</strong> We all have the ISLD memorized, Nathaniel.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>North Carolina Republicans have already <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article259514019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a petition</a> with the Supreme Court challenging the state’s new congressional map on these grounds. If the court takes the case and rules in their favor, state courts will be taken out of the business of litigating partisan gerrymandering — in direct contradiction to that famous opinion in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rucho v. Common Cause</a>, which, in barring federal courts from deciding questions of partisan gerrymandering, specifically mentioned state constitutions as an alternative remedy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not only that, but state courts would also be barred from overturning discriminatory voter restrictions. And independent redistricting commissions could be in danger too, since they aren’t the legislature, and under the ISLD only legislatures can draw maps.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> This is another sign of how much the Supreme Court has changed since even a few years ago! Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a455_5if6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all suggested</a> that they would have blocked the North Carolina map, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that he wanted to address the question — just not on the shadow docket. Which means that Justice Amy Coney Barrett <a href="https://www.vox.com/22958543/supreme-court-gerrymandering-redistricting-north-carolina-pennsylvania-moore-toth-amy-coney-barrett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be the swing vote</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sooo Nathaniel … it seems like the court battles over this cycle of redistricting may get even fiercer, eh?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> For sure. These court battles are far from over. Several cases, like those in North Carolina and Ohio, are still pending. I expect to see multiple congressional maps tossed in the middle of the decade as courts finally get around to hearing some of these cases. And if the Supreme Court makes a precedent-shattering ruling, like gutting the VRA or embracing the ISLD, I bet several other states will reopen their congressional maps to take advantage of the new opportunities to gerrymander that are created.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>cwick: </strong>Phew, I thought I’d have to wait until 2030 to go through all of this again.</p>]]></description>
