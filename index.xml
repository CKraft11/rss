			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Narrow majorities and an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-an-ambitious-agenda-heres-what-they-should-learn-from-obamacare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious policy agenda</a> have proven to be a tough combination for Democrats. In the past few weeks, congressional Democrats have been involved in a number of talks among party factions and with the Biden administration over the fate of two major bills: their <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-11-trillion-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-big/story?id=79378221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan infrastructure bill</a> and their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/us/politics/government-shutdown-congress-infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion spending plan</a>. At this point, too, both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/us/politics/pelosi-infrastructure-house-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive</a> and more <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/politics/house-moderate-democrats-infrastructure-strategy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate Democrats</a> have threatened to walk away from the deals — one reason why so <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/25/biden-agenda-democrats-congress-514263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many headlines are declaring</a> that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/01/30/people-used-to-joke-about-democrats-in-disarray-theyre-not-joking-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are in disarray</a>. Moreover, regardless of the outcome of these specific bills, it is likely that struggles between moderate and progressive members of the party will continue to be an issue going forward.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But does this mean that the internal fault lines in the Democratic Party are likely to be detrimental to its functioning? Or are we just seeing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-23/are-democrats-in-disarray-or-just-negotiating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy negotiating</a> in a party that represents a diverse array of constituencies and interests?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On one hand, the resonance of the “Democrats in disarray” trope is due to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-too-much-media-attention-could-hurt-the-democrats-new-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the media’s interest in covering conflict</a>, and as was true historically, the Democratic Party remains a patchwork party. Coalitions have certainly changed — gone are the days of the <a href="https://millercenter.org/president/fdroosevelt/the-american-franchise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uneasy “New Deal Coalition”</a> between civil rights supporters and the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Dixiecrat_Revolt_and_the_End_of_the/EWu2AX7Gx4YC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=the+dixiecrat+revolt&amp;pg=PP5&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movement’s opponents</a> — but Democrats must now balance<strong> </strong>a multiracial coalition that is multifaceted in what it wants politically. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, the past several election cycles have featured debates between progressive and moderate Democrats over how far to the left the party should go in its stance on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/09/2020-election-news-democrats-embrace-15-minimum-wage-against-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising the minimum wage</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21005124/2020-presidential-candidates-health-care-democratic-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a universal health care system</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/14/20880659/2020-democratic-debates-climate-change-six-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressing climate change</a>.<strong> </strong>Splits in the Democratic Party are further complicated by the fact that support from voters without a college degree, who tend to be less likely to <a href="https://www.marottaonmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Understanding-Shifts-in-Democratic-Party-Ideology-Article.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identify as liberal</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is declining</a>, while college-educated voters, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who tend to be more liberal</a>, are growing in influence. These ideological divides are also evident by age: Younger voters, who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/election-young-voters-biden-democratic-party.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are generally more progressive</a> — especially on issues like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/10/30/young-voters-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> — are another important constituency shaping disagreements on economic and cultural issues in the party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, no matter how uneasy the coalition of progressives and moderates might be at times, Democrats are overall much closer ideologically than they were previously.<strong> </strong>Additionally, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative partisanship</a> means that no faction in the Democratic Party is likely to defect to the Republican Party or do anything that would help Republicans electorally (like splinter off and form a new political group). Finally, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationalized nature</a> of our party politics means that all members’ fortunes are increasingly tied to the party brand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, even though there is less ideological diversity in the Democratic Party today — <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/328367/americans-political-ideology-held-steady-2020.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very few Democrats identify as conservative</a>, for instance — the question of just how liberal Democrats are willing to go is still a big one that can cause a lot of problems for the party. As underscored by the recent negotiations over infrastructure and the budget, it’s possible, too, that some of these ideological fights are pretty muddy. In the House, there’s the progressive faction, represented by <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJayapal/status/1445025926627004416?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Pramila Jayapal</a>; the moderate faction, represented by <a href="https://www.insidernj.com/the-gottheimer-ascendancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Josh Gottheimer</a> and the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight other House moderates</a> who have worked to limit the spending in the bills; and the faction of “mainstream” liberals, who are ready and willing to cut deals, represented by leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three ideological factions is certainly challenging to manage, but it also makes sense for a party that represents such a wide range of constituencies. Often, compromises can be found to honor different preferences and priorities. On Friday, for instance, President Biden and Pelosi said that <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-floats-roughly-2-trillion-price-tag-for-reconciliation-08740ed0-2db3-4ce7-8088-2a1d36644e38.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting on the bipartisan infrastructure bill must again be delayed</a> until Democrats are able to make progress on their party’s spending plan. This move was a victory for progressives in that they had threatened to tank the bipartisan bill without being able to also vote on the Democrats’ ambitious budget. Cutting the spending plan’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/politics/progressives-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-democrats/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion price tag</a> — something moderates in the party have long pushed for — also points to the limits of what progressives will be able to demand in future negotiations. Remember, though, this big-tent party approach to politics isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it’s part of governing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is a more concerning possibility that Democrats are divided not only on questions of policy but also on an establishment versus anti-establishment dimension. Hints of this appear in the efforts of Democratic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/03/joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema-democrats-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin</a> to cultivate political reputations independent from — even in defiance of — their party. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/22/bernie-sanders-just-declared-war-on-the-democratic-establishment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anti-establishment</a> rhetoric has sometimes been a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-pelosi-versus-squad-paradigm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staple of the left</a>, too. Sen. Bernie Sanders liked to use these appeals during his two presidential bids, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/18/progressives-democratic-party-despair-255675" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presenting himself to supporters</a> as a rebuke to the party establishment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former FiveThirtyEighter <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-two-cracks-in-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry Enten and I wrote</a> about this phenomenon in the Republican Party in 2017, and four years later, it doesn’t seem like it was a positive development for the GOP. That’s because unlike policy, “outsider status” isn’t something that can be easily solved by compromise. As a result, the Republican Party has become less open to <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/for-2020-2003/html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissenting views</a> and a big-tent approach to policy and instead more dominated by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-might-still-be-trumps-party-but-that-doesnt-mean-theres-room-for-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a loyalty to former President Donald Trump</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible a similar fate <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/virginia-democrats-challengers-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could befall Democrats</a>. After all, Democrats’ two major bills could still fall apart, suggesting that the party’s differences are a serious hindrance to accomplishing Biden’s agenda. It’s also possible that some Democratic factions <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/primary-distrust-political-distrust-and-support-for-the-insurgent-candidacies-of-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-in-the-2016-primary/578E3061392DDE1BF3BE3F615054F97A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distrust the party’s leadership</a> enough to create a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/democrats-divided-progressives-centrists-say-trust-gone-a3d66f83ddac9b18e607f46429dbc408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent fault line</a> around “outsider” status, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/us/politics/tea-party-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Tea Party movement did for the Republicans</a>. However, the lack of a polarizing internal figure like Trump works in Democrats’ favor, and most congressional Democrats seem to at least want <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1041793588/a-looming-partial-government-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislative victories</a>, not just take public stances. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what will determine whether intra-party disagreement proves to be a healthy back-and-forth among Democrats or a dysfunctional rivalry? There are a few things to look for. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, the depth of the policy disagreements. So far, it hasn’t seemed like there was much disagreement over the Democrats’ need to pursue both bills — just over the strategy and dollar amount. That said, within the party, you can still see the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/31/are-we-entering-a-new-political-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stirrings of disagreement</a> around whether the country needs some of its basic structures overhauled — including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/12/18/democrats-campaign-is-fight-over-future-american-capitalism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy and income inequality</a>, voting rights protections, and questions like <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/statehood-for-washington-d-c-and-puerto-rico-background-and-political-implications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitting new states</a> or <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/15/democrats-introduce-legislation-expand-supreme-court/7233345002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restructuring the courts</a>. These issues could become widely held Democratic priorities, or they could expose serious variation in the way different legislators and their voters view American politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other danger is that the divisions among Democrats start to look like those in the party system at large — that is, more splits rooted in <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo27527354.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social identities</a> that are increasingly focused on winning rather than on identifying common goals. Put another way, if any faction of the Democratic party becomes more interested in <a href="https://www.legbranch.org/honest-messengers-how-symbolic-messaging-votes-in-congress-match-vote-choices-on-real-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messaging than legislating</a>, it’ll lose incentives to compromise. In fact, the incentives will ultimately go the other way, making it more attractive to take a stand than to pass a bill. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the Democratic Party doesn’t seem close to this situation right now. While it may not always seem like it, the different factions in the Democratic Party still represent policy differences — not fault lines. That’s namely because ideological differences still don’t map perfectly onto the party’s different constituencies. Yes, some of the party’s moderates, like Manchin, represent constituencies further from the mainstream of the Democratic Party — <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/which-us-states-are-the-oldest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">places with</a> more <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/WV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white, older voters</a>. But this isn’t true of all moderate Democrats. Rep. Carolyn Bordeaux of Georgia, for instance, represents a majority-minority district that has <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US1307-congressional-district-7-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantial populations</a> of Black, Latino and Asian residents. And while someone like Jayapal, who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, represents a far more diverse district with a lot of <a href="https://www.census.gov/mycd/?st=53&amp;cd=07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college-educated voters</a>, Rep. Ilhan Omar, who isn’t that different from Jayapal politically, hails from a district with a <a href="https://www.census.gov/mycd/?st=27&amp;cd=05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much lower share</a> of college-educated voters. As a result, ideological differences are not likely to create permanently warring factions in the Democratic Party — at least at this point. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Party divisions are inevitable in big-tent coalitions. Policy disagreements across the ideological spectrum are healthy: It’s arguably the efforts to flatten out these divisions among Republicans that have made the past few years so troubling for the Republican Party and its role in American democracy. The nature of partisan politics has also made it harder for internal factions to splinter from the Democratic Party. Trying to form a third party would tank electoral prospects and all but ensure Republican victories at the federal level. And Republicans are unlikely to go after progressives, regardless of how disgruntled that group might become with the Democratic leadership. This should allow progressives and moderates to form flexible coalitions in the long term, and hold off the biggest threat to party stability — one faction getting angry enough to leave altogether. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The government avoided a shutdown last week, but questions remain over how much of President Biden’s agenda Congress will pass. Democrats delayed a vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill after progressives said they would not vote for it without an agreement on a separate social programs bill. That latter bill is still in flux, though: West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin suggested a price tag <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/30/manchin-proposed-15t-topline-number-to-schumer-this-summer-514803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 trillion less</a> than what other Democrats originally proposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew tries to unpack what’s driving Democrats’ decisions and who will have to compromise to get both bills passed. They also address a listener question that suggests Republicans achieve their policy goals more often than Democrats. They discuss whether that assumption is really true, why partisans often <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/25/winners-and-losers-in-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feel the opposing party wins more</a> and how to measure victory in politics. Finally, they preview next month’s gubernatorial election in Virginia and what it can tell us about the 2022 midterms.</p>

			<title>Why The Supreme Court Probably Doesn’t Care What Most Americans Think About Abortion Or Gun Rights</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court is more conservative than it’s been in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/politics/supreme-court-conservative/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost a century</a>. ​​Its new term begins today, and by next June, when the term ends, Americans might finally understand what that means. Public opinion of the court is already <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354908/approval-supreme-court-down-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a record low</a> after the court allowed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a strict abortion law to go into effect in Texas</a> in early September. Now, the justices are preparing to hear the court’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/26/990846329/supreme-court-to-take-up-first-major-gun-rights-case-in-more-than-a-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first major gun rights case since 2010</a> as well as a case on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the future of abortion in the U.S.</a> Both cases could result in decisions that are far more extreme than most Americans want. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the past, a desire to preserve the court’s apolitical reputation <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-can-stop-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the justices</a> from straying too far from public opinion. That could happen again — in fact, Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-big-rulings-were-surprisingly-mainstream-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has so far proven remarkably adept</a> at producing decisions that protect the court’s reputation and that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ab215fc5f71b8d24e0360f69f011cf67" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are often portrayed</a> as more moderate and mainstream than they really are. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This term, though, the other conservative justices might be fine with taking a very public right turn. Neither <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-views-on-gun-control-have-changed-in-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding gun rights</a> nor <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-dont-want-roe-v-wade-repealed-but-many-also-support-restrictions-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturning Roe v. Wade</a> would be popular, yet the court is considering both — a sign of how conservative it has already become. The question now is whether the risk of a backlash is enough to keep the conservative majority from, say, overturning Roe in an election year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The justices are plainly conscious of public attitudes toward the court,” said <a href="https://polisci.osu.edu/people/baum.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawrence Baum</a>, a political science professor at Ohio State University. “But that’s only one consideration for the justices and not necessarily the most important one — particularly on issues like abortion or gun rights where they may have intense personal preferences about the right outcome.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The justices are already entering the term with mixed reviews from the general public. <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/22/poll-support-u-s-supreme-court-drops/5804331001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Marquette University Law School poll conducted in September</a> found that only 49 percent of Americans approved of the court, down from 60 percent just a year earlier. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354908/approval-supreme-court-down-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll conducted in September</a> found a similar drop: Only 40 percent of U.S. adults approved of the court, down from 53 percent a year earlier. According to Gallup, a majority (53 percent) of U.S. adults now disapprove of the way the court is handling its job.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In theory, the justices should have no reason to watch their polling numbers. Our system is actually designed that way: Federal judges have life tenure in part <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed78.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to insulate them from the vagaries of politics</a>. But research suggests that the justices are influenced by what Americans think, at least to a certain extent. For example, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2087255" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several studies</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00485.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have found</a> that the Supreme Court’s ideological tilt tracks with public opinion over time, which is unlikely to be coincidental. And <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/clark-tom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Clark</a>, a political scientist at Emory University, found in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00411.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate review</a> of congressional bills that when Congress introduced more bills designed to curb the court, the justices struck down fewer laws. According to Clark, that suggests that the court saw the bills as a signal from Congress that they were going too far, even though the bills were unlikely to pass.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this year, President Biden arguably introduced his own version of a court-curbing bill, in the form of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/us/politics/biden-supreme-court-packing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a commission to study</a> expanding the Supreme Court. But the conservatives don’t have a lot to fear there, at least for now, because the commission seems <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/10/22375792/supreme-court-biden-commission-reform-court-packing-federalist-society" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely to recommend</a> big changes. And even if it did, GOP senators won’t support court reform, which means Democrats <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56893296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would have to abolish the filibuster</a> to make that happen — currently <a href="https://www.vox.com/22319564/filibuster-reform-manchin-democrats-nuclear-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a no-go in the Senate</a>. All in all, the conservative justices don't have a lot of reason to see Biden's move as a threat.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It's also possible that Supreme Court justices mostly care about their reputation among a select group of Americans. Baum and <a href="https://law2.wm.edu/faculty/bios/fulltime/nedevi.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neal Devins</a>, a professor of law and government at the College of William &amp; Mary, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-company-they-keep-9780190278052?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have argued</a> that Supreme Court justices are more interested in how they’re regarded by elites. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is significant for understanding why the conservative justices’ behavior has become more predictably right-wing. Baum and Devins argue that as elites have grown more politically polarized, the justices’ partisan tendencies have hardened as well. In other words, the people influencing the conservative justices' thoughts are probably much more right-wing than the public at large. On top of that, some of the justices may be willing to risk backlash for the outcome they believe is correct. “Is legitimacy something that’s enough to get a justice to move away from something [he or she] strongly feels?” Baum told me. With the possible exception of Roberts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/john-roberts-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is particularly focused on the court’s image</a>, Baum doesn’t think the public’s views will be enough to sway a justice who cares deeply about the issue they’re deciding.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this might be right. On one hand, it’s not obvious that a single unpopular ruling -- even if it’s high-profile -- would be enough to sow widespread doubt in the Supreme Court’s legitimacy. Take the outcome in Bush v. Gore, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/13/us/bush-prevails-single-vote-justices-end-recount-blocking-gore-after-5-week.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where a divided Supreme Court</a>, split along partisan lines, effectively handed the presidency to George W. Bush. The ruling was intensely controversial at the time, but it <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4092195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to have had</a> little lasting impact on the court’s image. And although it might be hard to imagine, the same could be true of a decision that overturns or reshapes Roe — particularly if the justices  merely limit the constitutional right to abortion, rather than eliminate it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the question of how a highly conservative Supreme Court majority will navigate public opinion isn’t going away. And it becomes even more relevant if the conservatives maintain control of the court for years or even decades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In the past, even if the court was trending conservative overall, it wasn’t like the conservatives always won and the liberals always lost,” said <a href="https://pppa.wsu.edu/michael-salamone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Salamone</a>, a political science professor at Washington State University who studies the Supreme Court and public opinion. “Now it’s looking like conservative victories are going to be a lot more consistent and a lot more far-reaching.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In that sense, this new term might be a turning point — and not just because of the importance of the cases or the risk of a backlash to an individual decision. The next few months might be the beginning of a new era in which the conservative justices move sharply away from where most Americans stand on major issues, and dare politicians to do something about it.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This is the latest edition of our column that excavates the origins of public figures’ factually dubious comments. We explain what their claims are referring to, the evidence (or lack thereof) behind them and where they sprang from in the first place.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Who said what …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few weeks ago, Breitbart News — the right-wing, hyperpartisan news site <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/steve-bannon-breitbart-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formerly run by Steve Bannon</a> — published a truly <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galaxy brain</a> column. Editor-at-large <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2021/09/10/nolte-howard-stern-proves-democrats-want-unvaccinated-trump-voters-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Nolte argued</a> that Democrats have been promoting the COVID-19 vaccine not to save lives but instead to trick Republican voters into <em>not</em> getting the jab. Nolte’s theory concluded that this, in turn, would lead to unvaccinated Republicans getting sick and dying from COVID-19, ultimately helping Democrats electorally. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nolte claimed that liberals, in a sinister application of reverse psychology, knew that aggressively pushing the vaccine would lead those on the right to <em>resist</em>, putting them at greater risk for severe infection or death. “In a country where elections are decided on razor-thin margins, does it not benefit one side if their opponents simply drop dead?” Nolte wrote. He then said that the real way to stick it to liberals would be to embrace the “Trump Vaccine” for the life-saving modern miracle that it is.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sometimes flawed logic can still lead you to the correct conclusion.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/white-evangelicals-rethinking-politics-fivethirtyeight-80316696</p>


<h2><strong>Some background …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nolte’s take has emerged from the toxic politicization of the pandemic in the U.S. Since the COVID-19 vaccine rollout began in the U.S, there has been a partisan gap in vaccination rates. When comparing the rate of fully vaccinated people living in counties that voted for Trump in 2020 with those in counties that voted for Biden, blue counties had a higher vaccination rate by 12.9 percentage points, according <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>. Similarly, a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/covid19-vaccine-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> has shown that Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say they are unsure of whether they will get the vaccine. Republicans are also more likely to say they do not plan on getting vaccinated, according to that same poll. And it’s true that more right-leaning areas of the country are seeing more deaths from COVID-19, too: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent New York Times analysis</a> showed states with some of the highest 2020 vote share for Trump also have the highest death rates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These differences in vaccination rates and COVID-19 death rates can be attributed to a few factors, including misinformation online and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the erosion of trust</a> in institutions such as the medical system and the media over the past few years. It can also be partly attributed to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-0433cfa3b684b50d0c67ed254f8d8c39" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rhetoric from Republican leaders</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/conservative-talk-radio-covid-deaths/2021/08/31/a912a89c-0a66-11ec-aea1-42a8138f132a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figures on the right</a>, especially when you consider that similar partisan gaps <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/7/6/22554198/political-polarization-vaccine-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have not been seen in other countries</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is no evidence that those who have encouraged Americans to get vaccinated secretly hoped they would do the opposite. </p>

<h2><strong>Where the comment came from …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Brietbart column’s argument may seem unhinged, Nolte is in fact tapping into a number of right-wing tropes. Conspiratorial thinking has become a habit on the right — think the Big Lie or QAnon — so proposing a conspiracy to explain Republicans’ low vaccination rates may not be anathema for many of Nolte’s readers. Similarly, allegations of Democrats or leftists running false flag operations — where the responsible party for an event makes it look like another party is in fact behind the act — are common among the far-right. Many have claimed, for example, that the rioters who broke into the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 were actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/us/politics/antifa-conspiracy-capitol-riot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members of antifa disguised</a> to look like Trump supporters in order to make the right look bad. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The notion that politicians may be using reverse psychology when referencing the vaccine is also familiar to many on the right, albeit inverted from Nolte’s presentation of it. Those who oppose the vaccine — particularly those who incorrectly believe it to be harmful — have been surprised to hear former President Donald Trump promote it, and reverse psychology has been a useful explanation for his seeming deviation from their worldview. These theories claim that Trump’s encouragement of vaccinations would make the vaccine <em>less</em> appealing to anti-Trump voters, while arguing that those who support Trump are wise enough to “do their own research” and avoid it despite his recommendation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As far as him promoting it, my thought is [he is using] reverse psychology for the sheep with [<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/politics/trump-derangement-syndrome/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump Derangement Syndrome</a>] [who] will automatically just do the opposite of what he says,” one Telegram user wrote in a QAnon chat group. “What if Trump is promoting the vaccine to get the ‘Never’ Trumpers to rethink their decision,” wrote another in the same chat. “Anything he promotes they will do the reverse. He must know that those of us that are aware of the real and apparent dangers will NOT get it, even with his endorsement.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nolte also specifically tapped into another American tension: As the partisan gap persists, some on the left have shifted from encouraging those on the right to get vaccinated, to getting frustrated and angry that they still haven’t. This has manifested in sometimes flippant, sometimes cruel reactions to the high rates of infection and death among unvaccinated Americans. Nolte highlighted Howard Stern, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/09/09/howard-stern-unvaccinated-freedom-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who recently suggested</a> on his radio show that unvaccinated individuals who become sick should be denied medical care. Stern also said it was “funny” that some conservative radio hosts who spoke out against the vaccine <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/conservative-talk-radio-covid-deaths/2021/08/31/a912a89c-0a66-11ec-aea1-42a8138f132a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later died of COVID-19</a>. There’s also <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/09/hermancainaward-subreddit-antivaxxer-deaths-cataloged.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the r/HermanCainAward subreddit</a>, named after the Republican politician who died of COVID-19 in 2020, a group with 343,000 members that exists exclusively to mock people who expressed anti-vaccine views and later died of COVID-19.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, if Nolte’s column convinces some vaccine-resisters to get the shot, one <em>might</em> argue that the end justifies the means. But so far the response to the column on the right hasn’t been positive. On Breitbart’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/95475020353/posts/10168131523170354" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook post</a> sharing the column, many commenters rejected the argument, noting that their personal motivations for not getting vaccinated had nothing to do with what Democrats said, and pointing out that some unvaccinated Americans are on the left. “This is a stupid take. You have clearly bought into the democrat talking point that it’s only republicans not getting vaccinated when the reality is that people across the board are not getting vaccinated,” one Facebook user commented. Similar sentiments were shared on Telegram and the pro-Trump message board patriots.win. “Me not getting the Vax has absolutely nothing to do with what the left is saying!” one user wrote in a QAnon Telegram group. Another user in the same group noted: “But didn’t Trump get his vax? It isn’t about Trump, it’s about our personal health.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using conspiratorial thinking to bring conspiracy theorists back to reality may not be the most effective tactic after all. As one Telegram user put it: “Sounds like they’re trying to use reverse psychology by saying they are already using reverse psychology.” </p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats in Congress have their work cut out for them this fall. They were able to cut a deal with Republican lawmakers to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/politics/government-funding-shutdown-vote/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avert a government shutdown</a>, but when it comes to passing the rest of President Biden’s agenda, including both an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/us/politics/government-shutdown-congress-infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious $3.5 trillion spending plan</a> and a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-11-trillion-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-big/story?id=79378221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan infrastructure deal</a>, Democrats have much to sort out. It’s still too early to say how much jeopardy either bill is in — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-house-democrats-may-be-more-united-than-they-seem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assessing Democratic intraparty divisions is difficult</a> — but the fact that Senate Republicans have said <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/46-republican-senators-vow-not-233657646.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ll refuse</a> to help <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-mcconnell-stops-schumers-latest-attempt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise the debt ceiling</a> creates a real legislative challenge for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/treasury-secretary-warns-calamity-congress-raise-debt-limit/story?id=80283655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said the U.S. could run out of money as early as Oct. 18</a>, making it impossible for the U.S. to pay its current financial obligations and creating a risk of debt default that she said would be a “calamity” for the economy. And because almost all Senate Republicans have indicated they won’t vote to raise the debt ceiling, they’ve now created a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/28/politics/debt-limit-house-vote/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game of chicken</a> in which they are arguing that Democrats alone must pass an increase <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2021-05-25_IN11681_619c43d079c47dc0723890acd6318b5b1cd01e60.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through budget reconciliation,</a> while Democrats counter that the GOP should join them in a bipartisan vote to raise it, which is generally how it <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used to work in the Senate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, at this point, a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/27/debt-ceiling-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new poll from Politico/Morning Consult</a> suggests public opinion may not push either party to change course, especially Republicans. Overall, 31 percent of registered voters said they would mostly blame Democrats if the country defaults on its debt, while 20 percent said they would primarily blame the GOP. However, the plurality (39 percent) said they would blame both parties equally, while 11 percent said they didn’t know or had no opinion.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-agenda-passed-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80271395</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are also torn on whether to raise the debt ceiling, even though there could be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/09/28/how-worried-should-we-be-if-the-debt-ceiling-isnt-lifted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severely damaging ramifications</a> for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-default-6-million-jobs-15-trillion-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failing to raise it</a>. A survey conducted earlier this week by <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/574495-what-americas-thinking-september-29-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill/HarrisX</a> found that 54 percent of registered voters opposed raising the cap, while 46 percent supported the raise. (The poll didn’t include some kind of “don’t know” option, which, as we’ll see, may be important.) Meanwhile, a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/ab8vvo6g3z/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly poll from The Economist/YouGov</a> found that 34 percent of adults favored raising it and 32 percent opposed, with the remaining 34 percent undecided. In both surveys, Republicans were strongly opposed to raising the debt ceiling, while Democrats were about as strongly inclined to support an increase. Independents’ stance on the issue was murkier, but the polls suggested that these voters were slightly more opposed to raising the debt ceiling than they were supportive of it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s likely that many Americans don’t understand what the debt ceiling is or what raising it entails. Consider the high share of respondents who said they were unsure in The Economist/YouGov’s survey. Part of what’s tricky here is the debt ceiling refers to <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/debt-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debt and financial obligations the U.S. has already accrued</a> — such as interest on the country’s debt or previously authorized spending, like Social Security benefits. That is, the debt limit is not a tool that authorizes <em>new</em> spending, as such expenditures are decided in completely separate legislation, like a bill for the next federal budget.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Unfortunately, we don’t have recent polling that examines Americans’ understanding of the debt limit, but past polls back up the idea that many people don’t grasp what it is or what the risks are if it’s not increased. In a 2013 <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/4rsof3kpkv/tabs_HP_debt_limit_20131016%20TABS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HuffPost/YouGov</a> poll, for instance, 42 percent of Americans correctly responded that a higher debt ceiling allowed the country to pay interest on its debt and spending that’s already been authorized, but 39 percent mistakenly said that the debt ceiling directly increased government spending and the amount of debt the U.S. holds. This survey also found plenty of uncertainty, as 20 percent said they weren’t sure what raising the debt ceiling meant. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2011/05/24/more-concern-about-raising-debt-limit-than-government-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll by the Washington Post/Pew Research Center</a> from 2011 — when the debt-ceiling debate <a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/a-familiar-landmine-the-looming-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was particularly fraught</a> — also reflected a misunderstanding of the consequences of raising or not raising the debt limit. In the poll, more Americans were worried about what would happen if the debt ceiling was raised than if it wasn’t: 48 percent were more concerned that raising the debt ceiling would lead to more spending and debt, while 35 percent were more worried that not raising the cap would force a debt default and cause economic harm. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The political consequences of the public’s general lack of understanding are important, though, because it may guide the parties’ position on the debt ceiling. And Republicans may benefit the most, as their current opposition to raising the debt ceiling might be viewed by voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/us/politics/republicans-block-government-funding-bill-debt-limit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as part of their rejection of Democrats’ spending plans</a>. This comes despite the fact that the debt-limit debate is about paying off existing financial obligations — like previously authorized spending and interest on debt accrued <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by past administrations from both parties</a> — rather than any future obligations that the Democrats’ budget proposal might generate. Just how the debt-limit fight will sort itself out in the coming weeks is unclear, but should neither party blink or come to a bipartisan resolution, the country would enter uncharted territory, facing potentially disastrous financial fallout. And in that case, the question of which party is to blame might be a lot more complicated for voters.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1">Over 650 people</a> who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 seeking to overturn the 2020 election have been arrested and charged. But as the FBI tries to identify more rioters, 48 percent of U.S. adults thought the penalties were not severe enough, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/28/declining-share-of-republicans-say-it-is-important-to-prosecute-jan-6-rioters/?utm_content=buffer5d7b4&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Pew Research Center poll</a> that asked about the storming of the Capitol and the related House investigation. Yet, 57 percent of Republicans said there was already too much attention on Jan. 6, and Americans overall are unconfident in the investigation’s fairness, with a majority of Americans (54 percent) not too confident or not at all confident.</li><li>The Hispanic population represents 51 percent of the U.S. population growth between 2010 and 2020, with 19 percent of the country now identifying as either Hispanic or Latino, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html">data from the 2020 census</a>.

And this is good for some parents with kids under 12, as a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354998/covid-vaccine-young-child.aspx">recent Gallup poll</a> found that 55 percent of these parents said they would vaccinate their kids pending the FDA’s approval. And as the delta variant <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/22/delta-dominant-variant-mu-who/">continues to spread</a>, 53 percent of parents of children under 18 were worried their child would contract the virus, and pluralities of parents of school-aged children said schools should require all students (47 percent) and teachers and staff (49 percent) to mask up.</li><li>The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine">approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine</a> on Aug. 23, and according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355073/vaccinated-delta-surge-fda-decision.aspx">September survey from Gallup</a>, 75 percent of U.S. adults said they were fully or partially vaccinated.

A median of 56 percent of people polled thought their own society was doing a good job handling global climate change. But that doesn’t mean they were confident that this action would make a difference. The same survey found that a median of 52 percent of those polled were not confident that efforts by the international community would significantly reduce the effects of climate change.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, the FBI released nationwide crime statistics for 2020, which will likely contribute to the already tense political debate over crime and policing. <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-crime-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The data</a> showed a nearly 30 percent increase in murders compared with the year prior, the largest spike since national record-keeping began in 1960. Nevertheless, murder rates are significantly below what they were throughout the 1990s. Overall, violent crime increased by nearly 6 percent, while property crimes went down by 8 percent. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There aren’t many people like Taylor Bird in today’s Democratic Party. A former megachurch employee who has worked with various evangelical churches and organizations for the past decade, the 32-year-old from Lake Forest, California, is a politically progressive white evangelical Christian who believes in addressing systemic racism, protecting the vulnerable by masking up during the COVID-19 pandemic, tackling climate change and making it as easy as possible for immigrants to become U.S. citizens — both as a matter of faith and politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bird told me Jesus was “the ultimate progressive” because he “cared especially for marginalized groups like the poor, ethnic minorities and others who have been oppressed by society.” That’s why in 2015 and 2016, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/09/13/439833719/true-believer-why-donald-trump-is-the-choice-of-the-religious-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evangelicals largely started to accept</a> Donald Trump as their preferred presidential candidate, Bird felt as though he were living in an alternate reality. “I was looking at people I really respected as faithful Christians embracing this political candidate who was saying all these racist, authoritarian and outrageous things,” Bird said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bird has since chosen to distance himself from what he calls “the evangelical mainstream.” To be sure, though, he — and white evangelicals like him — remains in the minority. White evangelicals in the U.S. are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/08/rapid-decline-white-evangelical-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the decline</a>, however, making up just about <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 percent of Americans overall</a>, per a 2020 Public Religion Research Institute census of American religion. But despite people like Bird, white evangelicals are still the single largest ethnic-religious group among Republican voters. In 2016, the Pew Research Center found that 77 percent of white evangelicals <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=21-06-30%20Validated%20voters%202020%20report%20GEN%20DIST&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=8768&amp;lea=1873968&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for Trump</a>; in 2020, that number jumped to 84 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, some evidence suggests that as white evangelicals <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/15/more-white-americans-adopted-than-shed-evangelical-label-during-trump-presidency-especially-his-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solidified their religious beliefs</a> during Trump’s presidency, the number of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-and-more-americans-arent-religious-why-are-democrats-ignoring-these-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religiously affiliated Democrats declined</a>. Per Pew’s 2014 Religious Landscape Study, 54 percent of religiously <em>unaffiliated</em> people <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/party-affiliation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were Democrats or leaned that way</a> — <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up from 20 percent in 2009</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond Trump’s influence on the Republican Party, I wanted to understand why some white evangelicals have gravitated toward the Democratic Party, especially since they must wrestle with positions that can challenge their faith — like supporting abortion rights. I Iooked at polling data from past elections, researched issues important to evangelicals and spoke with five white evangelicals who identify as progressive or Democratic-leaning independents and learned that some of them haven’t fully fleshed out their views on certain reproductive health issues that have not only long guided Republican policy decisions but even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/03/evangelical-voters-will-almost-surely-vote-for-donald-trump-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompted many Christians to support the GOP</a> in the first place. Of the five people I spoke with, a few are former Republicans themselves or previously voted for Republican presidential candidates but think Trump’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/donald-trump-big-lie-explainer/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antidemocratic policies</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racist-racism-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist rhetoric went too far</a>; plus, a few say they don’t believe enough members of the Republican Party are doing enough to stand up for values that have been traditionally important to Christians. Yet despite often being more progressive in their views than other white evangelicals (largely thanks to Trump and Trumpism), a few told me that they’d consider voting Republican again should the party undergo a major facelift and disavow the former president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">White evangelicals’ devotion to the GOP is often treated as gospel, but this is a relatively new phenomenon. For a long time, evangelical Christians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/religion-politics-evangelicals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weren’t really active in American politics</a>. But that changed when Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, ran for president in 1976 with his <a href="https://www.anselm.edu/new-hampshire-institute-politics/blog/jimmy-carter-and-year-evangelicals-reconsidered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian faith front and center</a>. He was largely recognized as the first “<a href="https://www.thearda.com/timeline/events/event_44.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born-again</a>” president and ran his campaign on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-balmer-redeemer-president-buttigieg-booker-20190329-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the promise that he would</a> “never knowingly lie to the American people,” which fueled a brief but powerful emergence of a progressive evangelicalism movement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, many political scientists credit evangelicals with helping <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/jimmy_carters_evangelical_downfall_reagan_religion_and_the_1980_presidential_election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carter win the presidency</a>. That era of goodwill was short-lived, however. Disillusioned with Carter’s handling of certain social issues, many evangelicals <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/05/18/the_evangelical_presidency_reagans_dangerous_love_affair_with_the_christian_right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched their allegiance</a> to Ronald Reagan, the Republican presidential nominee four years later. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You cannot understand the movement of white evangelicals into the Republican Party without understanding their larger sense of cultural grievance,” said <a href="https://www.ou.edu/cas/history/people/faculty/steven-m-gillon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven M. Gillon</a>, a professor of history at the University of Oklahoma. “There were lots of specific issues that pushed them to get involved in politics — whether it be taxes, race or abortion — but the driving force that led them to abandon Carter and the Democrats and embrace Reagan was a sense that their cultural and political power was under assault by groups — women, gays and African Americans — that were now firmly entrenched in the Democratic Party. White evangelicals and the Republican Party had the same enemies. It is the one constant feature in their relationship from Reagan to Trump.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And since Reagan’s presidency, evangelicals have been consistently loyal to the GOP. As of 2020, nearly 34 percent of Republicans (including those who lean toward the GOP) were white evangelicals, compared with just 7 percent who identified as or leaned toward the Democrats. </p>

According to a December 2019<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-immigration-8d3eb99934accc2ad795aca0183290a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-immigration-8d3eb99934accc2ad795aca0183290a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion remains a major issue</a> for most white evangelicals. Sixty-seven percent told AP-NORC that they supported significant restrictions on abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s life, compared with just 37 percent of all Americans who felt the same way. Moreover, 80 percent of white evangelicals said <a href="https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/APNORC_Religion_2019-12-31_r1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religion should have “a lot” or “some” influence</a> on the government’s abortion policy. By comparison, just 41 percent of Americans said the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But abortion wasn’t as cut-and-dried for the progressive evangelicals I spoke with. Bird, for example, said that his views on abortion had evolved over time but he ultimately believed in a woman’s right to choose;<em> </em>as a man, he said he didn’t feel comfortable weighing in on health decisions that didn’t affect him directly. A chief financial officer for a major religious organization who prefers to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution for his political opinions told me that he hadn’t fully grappled with his beliefs on abortion rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“From a moral standpoint, I think it is wrong for a person to choose to have a fetus removed from their body. But I also think it’s probably wrong for a government to do anything about a person who chooses to do that,” he said. “God designed the process the way he designed it for a reason: While the choice a person makes might not be the one God wants them to make and may not be the optimal moral choice, I’m not sure the government should have a say in the process, either.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kristi Robertts, a 43-year-old from Lindenhurst, Illinois, holds a similar stance on the issue. She says it has been a journey for her to figure out where she stands on abortion. She is not sure she’ll feel the same way years down the line, but as of today, she considers herself “holistically pro-whole life.” Robertts told me she finds abortion “grotesque” and wishes no woman would ever have to get one, but she also said she’s “pro-woman” and recognizes a woman’s right to have autonomy over her body. “I don’t believe we’ll ever reduce abortion by restriction and oppression,” she said. “This is not a black-and-white issue.” Meanwhile, Jordan Parshall, 24, from Chicago, said he doesn’t spend much time thinking about abortion but  added that while he “doesn’t necessarily like abortion,” it’s not his place to judge those who have had one. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, these stances on abortion are not the norm among white evangelicals: A solid majority say they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-immigration-8d3eb99934accc2ad795aca0183290a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support making abortion illegal</a> in most cases. In fact, some of the progressive evangelicals I spoke with said they had friends or family members who supported Trump in 2016 and 2020 because<em> </em>he had promised to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usher in a conservative Supreme Court</a> that could <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/07/02/trump-makes-clear-roe-v-wade-is-on-the-chopping-block/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially dismantle Roe v. Wade</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But abortion wasn’t what mattered most to the people I interviewed. Instead, the two parties’ positions on health care, racism, climate change and immigration mattered more and, in many cases, led them to support Democratic candidates — although Trump’s presidency also played a significant role in turning them away from the GOP. Over the past five or so years, they said, pro-Trump Republicans had become more antidemocratic, and as a result, Democratic candidates now aligned more with their own political beliefs. Thirty-year-old Jason McCormick, for example, even moved to New Zealand shortly after Trump was elected in 2016 and has no immediate plans to return to the U.S., either. Robertts said she left the GOP in 2016 because<em> </em>of Trump’s presidency and held fairly progressive views now, especially on immigration, health care and racism and reparations. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1098" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SAMUELS-WHITE-EVANGELICAL-OUTLIER-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SAMUELS-WHITE-EVANGELICAL-OUTLIER-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SAMUELS-WHITE-EVANGELICAL-OUTLIER-3.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SAMUELS-WHITE-EVANGELICAL-OUTLIER-3.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In this sense too, the white evangelicals I spoke with were unique in their stances. For most white evangelicals, the top issues as of 2016 were national security and government corruption. But among those who had moved away from the larger evangelical community, many attributed this departure to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/16/theyre-rapists-presidents-trump-campaign-launch-speech-two-years-later-annotated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s attitudes and policies toward immigrants</a> or his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/looting-starts-shooting-starts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handling of the protests</a> that rocked the world following <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-guilty-verdict-for-derek-chauvin-doesnt-change-the-reality-of-police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the murder of George Floyd</a> in May 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’ve been shifting left on race issues over the last few years, but obviously what our country went through last year with George Floyd was horrific,” said the chief financial officer who wanted to remain anonymous. “Now that I live in a major metropolitan area … and have more friends of all different colors and backgrounds, I just think it’s egregious the ways in which the Republican Party and evangelicals seem to ignore and dismiss issues of race from the public discourse. That is unequivocally something that Jesus would have been bothered by.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, though, none of the white evangelicals I interviewed expressed concerns that they were abandoning their religion by siding with the Democratic Party. In fact, many said they saw their politics and religious identity as going hand-in-hand. “All of my beliefs come down to my conviction that Jesus laid down his life for humankind, so his followers are called to lay down their lives,” Bird said. “In other words, to sacrifice our own needs, wants and comfort for the sake of others.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, disdain for the current GOP, or for Trump, seems the bigger motivator for those I spoke with to go <em>against </em>the GOP as opposed to social issues motivating them to vote <em>for </em>Republicans — as is <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2007/10/15/a-portrait-of-republican-social-issue-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often the case with religious voters</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, these progressive evangelicals’ disdain doesn’t mean they aren’t critical of Democrats. In fact, since some of the evangelicals I spoke with cited Trump as the main reason why they hadn’t voted Republican, at least one said he might consider voting for the GOP again should the party eventually distance itself from Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/gop-critics-of-trumps-big-lie-are-struggling-to-win-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t seem as if the GOP is headed in that direction</a> anytime soon, though, but the CFO I spoke with stressed that parties change over time. “If I didn’t say that I’d least consider Republicans moving forward, then I would not be a critical thinker and I’d be a closed-minded person,” he said. “Both the Republican and Democratic parties now are much different than they were 60 years ago.” In the near term, though, he’ll probably continue voting for Democrats. Other progressive evangelicals I spoke to, like Parshall and Robertts, said they were far less inclined to ever support the GOP again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, these white evangelicals are still very much in the minority. During Trump’s presidency, more white Americans adopted the evangelical label than shed it: Among all white adults whom <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/15/more-white-americans-adopted-than-shed-evangelical-label-during-trump-presidency-especially-his-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew surveyed in both 2016 and 2020</a>, the share who described themselves as born-again or evangelical Protestants jumped 4 percentage points — from 25 percent in 2016 to 29 percent last year. Yet some of the progressive evangelicals I spoke with were optimistic that there were more white evangelicals like them than we might realize. “There was a point in my life when I didn’t know anybody like me and would actually sit back in judgment and say you can’t be a ‘real Christian’ and progressive at the same time,” Robertts said. “But in the last five to six years, I have seen how extraordinarily untrue that is and met people who are like-minded. And I think that, in time, our little section will grow and grow and grow.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Once a year, members of Congress take a break from delivering grandiose speeches and passing historic legislation to do something significantly more humbling: play baseball. On Wednesday evening, Democrats and Republicans will face off in the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/Congressional-Baseball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Baseball Game</a>, an annual event<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the game was &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/07/16/canceled-annual-congressional-baseball-game-takes-a-hit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; last year for the first time in 60 years on account of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> that raises <a href="https://time.com/4820569/steve-scalise-shooting-congressional-baseball-game-raises-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> for charity. Though the play is something less than major league quality, the game is beloved enough to fill the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/nationals/tickets/congressional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower seating bowl</a> at Nationals Park, inspire <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/rand-paul-at-bat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creative signs and cheers</a>, and even <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-calculated-advanced-stats-for-the-congressional-baseball-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attract its own sabermetricians</a>.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the stats entering this year’s game, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugXP6qar3m3jmKtjsUp-AFWLyVeQOOK-3b9DblPTRks/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;look no further&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the appeal of the Congressional Baseball Game is that it lets some of the most powerful people in the world unburden themselves for a night and enjoy participating in the national pastime. But we wondered: What if these political players had the same clout in their favorite sport as they have in their day jobs? What if the people who write the laws of the land also wrote the rules of Major League Baseball?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So we asked them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We contacted the offices of all <a href="https://www.congressionalbaseball.org/teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 Democrats and 38 Republicans</a> on this year’s rosters and sent them seven questions about the biggest debates in Major League Baseball — everything from bat flips to bringing the designated hitter to the National League. Nineteen of them<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic Reps. Mike Doyle, Jared Huffman, Tom Malinowski, Joe Morelle, Jimmy Panetta and Ed Perlmutter and Sen. Chris Murphy; Republican Reps. Mike Bost, Tim Burchett, Kat Cammack, Chuck Fleischmann, Mike Garcia, Kevin Hern, John Moolenaar, Barry Moore, Blake Moore, Pete Sessions, Greg Steube and Brad Wenstrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> got back to us — a 28 percent response rate that any pollster these days <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/27/response-rates-in-telephone-surveys-have-resumed-their-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would envy</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it turns out that members of Congress — Republicans and Democrats alike — are traditionalists. (As Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski put it, “I am a politics liberal but a baseball conservative.”) Though they’re OK with some of the cultural changes that have reshaped the game in recent years, they’re broadly opposed to the new or proposed rules that are currently hot topics in the league. What’s more, their opinions on baseball matters often run counter to the preferences of their constituents — the American people!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First off, 13 of the 19 congresspeople we surveyed (68 percent) opposed the universal DH and wanted pitchers to continue hitting in the National League.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six who supported it were Malinowksi, Moolenaar, Barry Moore, Sessions, Steube and Wenstrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> “One of the things that makes baseball unique is that there are differences between the American and National League,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told FiveThirtyEight. Republican Rep. Blake Moore agreed and used data to back up his point: “The World Series win count since 1973, when the designated hitter was implemented, is essentially equal between leagues (25 American League wins, 22 National League wins). These data suggest there is no inherent advantage for one league over the other.” Republican Rep. Brad Wenstrup, however, reluctantly disagreed. “I personally would like the AL to adopt pitcher hitting, rather than have the NL cave. But the rules should be the same.” And Wenstrup can rest easy knowing the public is on his side: A March 2021 <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wave-57-Data-Tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harris/The Athletic poll</a> found that 59 percent of adults who followed MLB supported bringing the DH to the National League, while only 41 percent opposed it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Second, 12 of the 19 (63 percent) said they disliked the new rule that each game in a doubleheader lasts only seven innings<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five said they liked it — Burchett, Doyle, Blake Moore, Perlmutter and Steube — while Hern and Barry Moore were unsure or skipped this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> — even though, ironically, the Congressional Baseball Game itself is only seven innings long. “Seven inning contests involving a ball and bat are called softball games,” Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle insisted. “I don’t think Ernie Banks was ever heard to [say], ‘let’s play two — as long as they’re only seven innings each!’” However, Morelle’s own manager on the Democratic team, Rep. Mike Doyle, disagreed with this succinct note: “Have you ever tried to sit through a double-header … BORING!” For what it’s worth, the fans are on Doyle’s side: 70 percent of respondents to the Harris/The Athletic poll said they agreed with MLB’s decision to shorten doubleheaders in 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, 12 of our 19 respondents (63 percent) said they weren’t a fan of the new rule in which extra innings begin with a runner already on second base<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six people who were OK with the change were Cammack, Hern, Blake Moore, Murphy, Panetta and Steube. Barry Moore didn’t answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> — and many of them felt strongly about it. Malinowski let out an audible shudder when we asked him this question over the phone. And Morelle quipped, “The innovator who created the rule that places runners on second base to start extra innings must have been the same genius that devised mini games for doubleheaders. … This is the classic case of a solution searching for a problem.” Fans oppose this rule change too: According to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/07/23/ahead-of-2020s-first-pitch-baseball-fans-largely-approve-of-mlb-rule-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> from July 2020 (just before the rule was implemented), only 34 percent of MLB fans had a favorable opinion of it, while 42 percent had an unfavorable one. Moore, though, proposed an interesting compromise: “I would prefer that rule to start after the 12th inning, and never during playoff elimination games.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Opposition ran even stronger to our fourth question: whether home-plate umpires should be replaced by an automated system to call balls and strikes. Seventeen of the 19 congressional baseball players (89 percent) said no.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huffman and Morelle were the two who liked the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> “You can’t kick dirt on a balls and strikes machine,” Malinowski explained, echoing the sentiment of several other members. According to Harris/The Athletic, this is a divisive idea among followers of MLB, too, although it enjoys significantly stronger support with them (51 percent) than it does in Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And virtually no one liked the idea of moving the pitching mound back to encourage offense: 16 (84 percent) were against it, and the other three<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Moore, Blake Moore and Murphy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> didn’t express a definitive opinion either way. Ever the manager, Doyle feared that pitchers’ “arms would fall off!” Meanwhile, Morelle contended, “There’s magic in the 60 feet, 6 inches of distance between the pitcher’s mound and the plate! I would however consider lowering the mound.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just when we thought members of Congress were going to oppose every recent change in MLB, they threw us a curveball. Twelve of 19 (63 percent) said they approved of hitters flipping their bats after a big home run. (Only three<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burchett, Garcia and Morelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> said they disapproved, while the other four<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleischmann, Huffman, Panetta and Steube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> had no opinion.) “Baseball needs more fun and less enforcement of stuffy unwritten rules,” Wenstrup declared, and Murphy went so far as to say, “I think it’s one of the best things about baseball.” According to a <a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PPP_Release_National_51216.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Polling survey</a> from May 2016, many MLB fans, especially younger ones, agree: 48 percent overall said they approved of bat flips, while 31 percent disapproved. (Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 79 percent approved and only 9 percent disapproved.) Morelle, though, called bat flipping “amateurish and immature.” He went on to say: “My father admonished me a long time ago whether it was hitting safely in baseball, scoring a touchdown in football, or sinking a fade-away jumper in basketball to ‘act like you’ve done it before.’” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the question over which members of Congress have the most genuine disagreement? Whether advanced metrics have had a net positive or net negative impact on the game. Nine of 19 (47 percent) said positive; five<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burchett, Doyle, Garcia, Huffman and Morelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> (26 percent) said negative; and the other five<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moolenaar, Barry Moore, Blake Moore, Murphy and Wenstrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> didn’t come down one way or the other. “Look, I loved ‘Moneyball,’” Moore wrote in an email. “But the reason the Oakland A’s were so good that year was because they had three of the best aces in baseball (Mulder, Zito, &amp; Hudson). It wasn’t solely because of On Base Percentage.” Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman felt like “some of the soul of the game is lost when it becomes all about the numbers and the data.” And Doyle came out against sabermetrics too. “I’m old school,” the Democratic manager explained.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Several of the congresspeople we contacted were so excited to talk about baseball that they didn’t want to stop at just the seven questions we asked. For instance, Wenstrup signed off with a succinct three-point platform: “Fire Manfred. <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/4/20/22394351/pete-rose-major-league-baseball-hall-of-fame" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let Pete in</a>. And bring back ten cent beer night.” And Malinowski spoke out, unprompted, against the infield shift — something that divides MLB fans exactly 50-50, according to the Harris/The Athletic poll. “I think infielders, like Americans, are shifting too far left and right, and I’d like to see them more down the middle,” he opined.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Several congressional baseball players also lamented that MLB games these days are too slow, with two (Murphy and Morelle) advocating specifically for a pitch clock. “Pitchers used to get the ball back from the catcher and get ready to throw again. Today you can send out for pizza, wash the car, take a shower, and not miss a pitch,” Morelle complained. “Please, for the love of all that is holy institute a pitch clock!” Then, no doubt speaking for all our interviewees, he concluded: “I hope I can now look forward to a call from the Commissioner’s Office!” Considering that multiple MLB commissioners actually started their careers in politics, perhaps Rob Manfred should be looking over his shoulder.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Two factions of the Democratic Party in Congress are currently playing tug-of-war over the centerpieces of President Biden’s legislative agenda. Moderate Democrats have balked at the proposed $3.5 trillion reconciliation budget bill, attempting to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay a vote on it in the House</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/manchin-favors-trimming-biden-budget-plan-half-79977681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insisting that the price tag will have to come down in the Senate</a>. At the same time, House progressives have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/politics/progressives-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-democrats/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened to block</a> a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill unless the reconciliation bill passes first — with the current price tag intact. (The House is scheduled to vote on the infrastructure bill <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pelosi-sets-thursday-vote-passage-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Thursday</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s easy to blow these disagreements out of proportion. On one hand, they are certainly relevant in that they threaten to derail two potentially transformative pieces of legislation. But they do not mean that Democrats are a hopelessly — or even significantly — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/21/democrats-biden-domestic-agenda-implode-513218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divided party</a>. Instead, it’s really the narrowness of Democrats’ congressional majorities that makes passing big legislation difficult, as even a small number of defectors can make the difference in a bill passing or failing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, the number of House moderates who attempted to hold up the reconciliation bill last month was only nine — enough to make the difference in a tight chamber, yes, but a drop in the bucket compared with the entire Democratic caucus, and plenty of moderate Democrats in the House <em>didn’t</em> stand in the way. (The progressive dissent may be more widespread — one congressman <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahnferris/status/1442901307346456577?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that “dozens” of progressive votes were on the fence — but it’s hard to know how seriously to take these threats, given that only a few representatives have gone public with them.) In addition, more stories will get written over the course of a long negotiation, which can lead to a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-too-much-media-attention-could-hurt-the-democrats-new-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media emphasis on the messy sausage-making process</a> over the (often less acrimonious) outcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, there’s good reason to think that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s current Democratic caucus is the <em>opposite</em> of in disarray. When it comes down to brass tacks, Democrats are (so far) the most united House caucus of the last three sessions of Congress. According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Biden Score</a>, which measures how often individual members of Congress vote in line with Biden’s position, 203 out of the House’s 223 Democrats<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are actually currently only 220 Democrats in the House, but we’re also considering the voting records of former Reps. Marcia Fudge, Deb Haaland and Alcee Hastings, who either resigned or passed away during 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> have voted with Biden 100 percent of the time, and all but two have voted with him at least 90 percent of the time. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This makes the current Democratic caucus far more cohesive than both the current Republican caucus and the Democratic caucus during the 115th Congress (based on the Biden and Trump scores<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-the-trump-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;same concept&lt;/a&gt; as the Biden Score, except measuring agreement with former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> of the median 90 percent of their members), when Democrats were last in the House minority. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Democrats in the House are really united behind Biden" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/csjul/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="424" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">One reason why Democrats have been so unified is that there are <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo25125939.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structural reasons</a> to expect a majority caucus to be more cohesive than a minority one. For one thing, minority-party members’ “votes don’t make or break legislation a lot of the time,” <a href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/gkoger@miami.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregory Koger</a>, a professor of political science at the University of Miami, told FiveThirtyEight, so “there is a little more leeway for them to break with their party.” For another, majority-party members (especially when the president is also of that party) have a clear electoral incentive to get things done. “All Democrats — regardless of whether they’re moderate or progressive — really need the Biden administration to succeed,” said <a href="http://www.blochrubin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruth Bloch Rubin</a>, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. But on the other hand, the minority party has “competing incentives: They want the president to look ineffective but also want to bring things home to their district.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps most importantly, the majority party also has an advantage in that it sets the congressional agenda, and congressional leaders don’t typically bring bills to the floor unless they are sure they are going to pass. As a result, only bills with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad support within the caucus</a> get voted on, making the majority party look more cohesive than it would if the minority party was calling the shots. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some ways, however, this is a key shortcoming of our Biden Scores: They don’t measure the votes not taken or what goes on behind the scenes. “In historical cases, a lot of really important negotiation happens before legislation hits the floor,” said Bloch Rubin. “Not to undercut the value of looking at final votes … but a lot of the time that’s not where the most important action is.” In fact, a real-life example of that is unfolding before our eyes right now in the Senate, where it’s likely that the opposition of moderate Sen. Joe Manchin will force Democrats to lop off a trillion dollars or two from the reconciliation bill. (Manchin, though known as one of the biggest internal thorns in Democrats’ sides, has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/joe-manchin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 percent Biden Score</a>.) A similar dance occurred with Democrats’ voting-rights bill earlier this year: The For the People Act was <a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/opinion/op_ed_commentaries/joe-manchin-why-im-voting-against-the-for-the-people-act/article_c7eb2551-a500-5f77-aa37-2e42d0af870f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too far-reaching for Manchin’s tastes</a>, so it was pared down into the less ambitious <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/revised-democratic-voting-bill-drops-controversial-provisions-tweaks-others-as-pressure-for-action-mounts/2021/09/14/6c59def8-150a-11ec-9589-31ac3173c2e5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom to Vote Act</a>, which Manchin helped craft and is now likely to support.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">So it makes good sense that Democrats in the 117th Congress are more united than Republicans are in the 117th or Democrats were in the 115th. But it doesn’t explain why they are <em>even more united </em>than the Republican majority was in 2017-18. During that 115th Congress, the middle 90 percent of Republicans (so again disregarding the outliers in the top and bottom 5 percent) had <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump Scores</a> between 81 and 99 percent. That 18-point range is not nearly as narrow as the 3-point range that separates the middle 90 percent of the current Democratic caucus. Put another way, Republicans were a bit more cohesive when they had the majority than they are now — but Democrats are <em>a lot</em> more cohesive now than when they were in the minority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why have Democrats been so successful at keeping their caucus in line? Koger sees <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4620079" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two reasons</a>: the fact that Democrats’ majority is so narrow (there are only <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight more Democrats</a> in the House than Republicans) and Republican opposition to the Democratic agenda. “If Pelosi could count on 20, 30 or 40 percent of Republicans to vote for a bill, there would be less pressure on Democrats to unite,” Koger said. But now, “when the majority party wants to do something, that typically involves corralling all its members.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, a larger majority means leadership has a wider margin of error; they can afford to not whip votes as aggressively or to allow members to vote their conscience (or cast a vote that might be more defensible to their constituents). But when a House majority is this narrow, there is more pressure to toe the party line. “It’s a lot of pressure to go out on the floor and sink a vote,” <a href="https://www.mattglassman.com/?page_id=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Glassman</a>, a former congressional staffer and now a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute, told FiveThirtyEight. “Everyone knows they <em>can</em> do it, but everyone’s terrified of doing it.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As such, both Bloch Rubin and Glassman expressed skepticism that progressives would ultimately scuttle the infrastructure bill. “They all want this infrastructure bill to pass,” said Bloch Rubin, and Glassman likened the negotiations to a performance where “everyone is trying to get to yes” but publicly threatens to vote no in order to “move policies incrementally closer to where they want them to be.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this, progressive Democrats differ from their far-right counterparts in the House Freedom Caucus, who are more doctrinaire and willing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/12/15769282/conservatives-threat-budget-trump-tax-reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">torpedo their party’s agenda</a> — for instance, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/18/farm-bill-fails-597661" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting down a 2018 farm bill</a> because then-House Speaker Paul Ryan did not first hold a vote on a controversial immigration bill. “The progressive caucus has never really wanted to take the next step and fight stuff on the floor,” Glassman said. “[They] work within the system.” This fundamental difference between the parties’ extreme flanks is another big reason why this Democratic majority is more cohesive than the last Republican one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pelosi, who has a reputation as a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/06/851343192/understanding-nancy-pelosi-she-knows-exactly-what-her-leverage-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener">master legislative tactician</a>, deserves some credit as well. “I would hardly say that structural factors alone are doing the work,” said Bloch Rubin. “She knows how to play her cards well.” In fact, Glassman told us that Pelosi’s unique strength isn’t in whipping votes; instead, both he and Bloch Rubin pointed to her ability to manage the factions within the Democratic coalition. Her job is essentially negotiator-in-chief, “making sure all members of the coalition are OK with the outcome,” Glassman said. “And I think Pelosi is very skilled at making sure everyone gets just enough of what they want.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ironically, though, an open negotiation process like the one Democrats are currently in can leave outside observers with the impression that a party is divided even if the legislation being debated ultimately succeeds. “It’s very hard to tell the difference between a caucus that’s in disarray and one that’s in the late stages of bargaining with each other,” Glassman said. “The visible evidence is the same.” Media coverage of the negotiations usually doesn’t help matters, either; according to <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo25681072.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research by political scientist Mary Layton Atkinson</a>, the press covers controversial legislation far more often than it does bipartisan legislation, and that coverage generally focuses on the conflict and drama of the negotiations over the substance of the bill. To Bloch Rubin, though, this type of coverage misses the broader point that Pelosi has proven adept at steering Democrats’ squabbling factions toward an outcome that actually benefits her party in the end.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Glassman identified one other reason why Democrats appreciate and appear so unified under her: “She protects them from votes they don’t want to take on the floor.” In other words, she is good at agenda-setting and not holding votes until negotiations are complete. We saw an example of this just days ago: The infrastructure vote was actually originally scheduled for Monday, but Pelosi postponed it until Thursday in order to buy more time for negotiations. “I'm never bringing to the floor a bill that doesn't have the votes,” she <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-delay-vote-senate-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill/story?id=80232564" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained to ABC News</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">All this is not to say you should ignore the very real policy differences between Democrats’ moderate and progressive flanks. (For one thing, they’ll continue to be an important fissure in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic primaries</a> in 2022 and 2024.) But those divisions popping up in Congress does not necessarily make Democrats ineffective at governing. Negotiations, by definition, highlight disagreements, but the final proof will be in whether Democrats pass the infrastructure bill on Thursday (and, on some later date, the reconciliation bill). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, it’s possible for a party to <em>have divisions</em> but not <em>be divided</em> — and a strong congressional leader like Pelosi can make that happen. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden hasn’t been shy about undoing the legacy of his immediate predecessor. It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFUgU1v-XiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rallying cry of his presidential campaign</a>, and as such it has defined his first eight months in office. On Biden’s first day in the White House, he signaled climate change would once again be a top issue by bringing the United States <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/inauguration-day-live-updates/2021/01/20/958923821/biden-moves-to-have-u-s-rejoin-climate-accord" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back into the 2015 Paris Agreement</a>, which Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrawn from</a> when he was president. Biden also reversed Trump’s ban on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/politics/lloyd-austin-transgender-military-harris-biden/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transgender Americans serving in the military</a> and has taken a number of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/biden-rescind-1776-commission-executive-order/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steps</a> to <a href="https://law.ucla.edu/news/biden-reverses-trump-executive-order-banning-diversity-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repudiate</a> a president who made <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/storming-the-u-s-capitol-was-about-maintaining-white-power-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white identity politics</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-rise-of-white-identity-politics-explains-the-fight-over-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial resentment</a> central to his message.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One notable exception is how Biden has handled America’s relationship with China. On this issue, Biden has hardly distanced himself from Trump: In fact, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/world/asia/china-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s tough-on-China approach has arguably been even tougher</a>. Biden has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/biden-china-tariffs-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept in place</a> many of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/09/13/meet-new-china-strategy-same-old-china-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the much-maligned Trump tariffs</a>. He’s also <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-china-covid-origin-report-b1910207.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harshly criticized China</a> for its role in handling the coronavirus outbreak. And he’s taken to task its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/china-genocide-human-rights-report/2021/03/30/b2fa8312-9193-11eb-9af7-fd0822ae4398_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human rights track record</a> and<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/parting-shot-trump-administration-declares-chinas-repression-uighurs-genocide-2021-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> expressed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/us/politics/biden-china-taiwan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for an independent Taiwan</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trump-biden-taiwan-china/2021/01/13/1bbadee0-53c0-11eb-acc5-92d2819a1ccb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two things</a> the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trump-biden-taiwan-china/2021/01/13/1bbadee0-53c0-11eb-acc5-92d2819a1ccb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump administration</a> also did, albeit at the last minute.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are, of course, important differences between Trump and Biden; namely, Biden is far <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/09/us-uk-australia-china/620094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more multilateral</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/world/asia/climate-china-us-kerry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooperative</a> in his approach to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/04/26/what-does-bidens-first-100-days-tell-us-about-his-approach-to-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign policy</a> in general. By and large, though, Biden’s approach to China has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-china-policy-is-emergingand-it-looks-a-lot-like-trumps-11623330000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resembled that of Trump’s</a>, which is notable in our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeply polarized political era</a> when moments of consensus between the two major parties are rare. That said, Republicans and Democrats are still considerably divided over what America’s relationship with China should look like, which is why U.S.-China relations are unlikely to create an opportunity for bipartisanship going forward, even if both parties consider China an adversary. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To understand why Biden’s approach to China is often considered “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-23/bloomberg-new-economy-when-it-comes-to-china-biden-is-trump-2-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump 2.0</a>,” it’s important to first establish Americans’ attitudes toward China. Broadly speaking, Americans of all political stripes don’t view the country favorably. Though Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/07/30/americans-fault-china-for-its-role-in-the-spread-of-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disagree</a> as to whether the Chinese government should be held responsible for the role it played in the coronavirus outbreak, Americans’ feelings toward the country <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-blaming-china-for-the-pandemic-probably-wont-help-trump-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have gotten worse</a> since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center</a> in February found that two-thirds of Americans — including 79 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of Democrats<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes Republican-leaning independents and Democratic-leaning independents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> — harbored “somewhat cold” or “very cold” feelings toward China,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents indicated their feelings using a “feeling thermometer,” where a rating of zero degrees means they feel as cold and negative as possible, a rating of 100 degrees means they feel as warm and positive as possible, and a rating of 50 degrees means they don’t feel particularly positive or negative toward China. “Cold” ratings ran between 0 and 49, and “warm” ratings ran between 51 and 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> and a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1627/china.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February survey from Gallup</a> found that 79 percent of Americans overall said their opinion of China was “mostly” or “very” unfavorable — by far the highest level of disfavor the polling firm has found since it started asking the question in 1979. That includes 41 percent of Americans who said they viewed China “very” unfavorably, up from 24 percent the year before.</p>

</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, though, it appears that China’s atrocious record on human rights, rather than its handling of COVID-19, accounts for more of the public’s dislike, which transcends parties. In fact, when asked by Pew to identify the first thing that comes to mind when they think about China, one-fifth of Americans — including 22 percent of Democrats and 21 percent of Republicans — said they thought about “human rights.” By contrast, just 7 percent of Americans said they immediately thought of COVID-19.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In recent years, China has come under fire for its harsh repression of political dissidents and ethnic and religious minorities, perhaps most notably <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/12/surviving-the-crackdown-in-xinjiang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Uyghurs in northwest China</a>. The Chinese government has been accused of engineering a campaign of mass internment and sterilization of Uyghurs, using a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/china-ai-surveillance/614197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sophisticated system of wide-spread surveillance</a> to carry out the abuses. The U.S. Senate has responded, in part, by passing separate bipartisan measures <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/menendez-cornyn-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-to-designate-uyghur-human-rights-abuses-by-china-as-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">labeling the treatment of Uyghurs a genocide</a> and banning the import of goods — alleged to be manufactured with forced labor — <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57847912" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from China’s Xinjiang region</a>. The Senate also allowed sanctions against China for human rights violations as part of a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/06/08/senate-china-science-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$250 billion bill</a> passed in June.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Democrats and Republicans favor a “tough on China” approach when it comes to addressing those abuses, too. According to Pew’s February survey, 69 percent of Democrats and 72 percent of Republicans support promoting human rights in China even if it hurts economic ties between the United States and China. By contrast, only 29 percent of Democrats and 24 percent of Republicans favor strengthening economic relations even if it entails not addressing human rights. And though there’s been less polling on Americans’ views of China-Taiwan relations, clear majorities of Americans support recognizing Taiwan as an independent country, including it in international organizations and signing a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement, according to a <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/2021%20Taiwan%20Brief.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July survey from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, though, many Americans also view China as a serious economic threat. Roughly 9 in 10 Americans would describe China as a “competitor” or an “enemy,” while only 9 percent consider it a “partner,” according to Pew’s February survey. Half of Americans also thought that China — not the United States — was the world’s leading economic power, per Gallup, and over 60 percent of Americans believed that China’s economic power would pose a “critical” threat to the United States over the next 10 years. Lawmakers in Washington have taken notice, as well, with the Senate’s $250 billion June bill heavily investing in science and technology so that the United States can stay competitive with China. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, however, Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are generally skeptical</a> of the net benefit that tariffs, including those on goods from China, provide the United States, with 44 percent of Americans saying the measures were bad and 30 percent saying they were good (23 percent thought they had no net effect), according to Pew’s February survey. Republicans were not only more pro-tariff than Democrats but also more likely to support a tougher economic approach to China more generally.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just a question of how tough to be economically toward China, either. There are some fairly clear limits to bipartisanship when it comes to addressing China’s ascendancy. Roughly half of Republicans in that February Pew survey thought of China “as an enemy” of the United States, while only one-fifth of Democrats felt the same way. And according to a <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/report_2020ccs_americadivided_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 2020 survey from the Chicago Council</a>, strong majorities of Republicans supported significantly reducing trade between the United States and China, even if American consumers have to pay more for goods; restricting the exchange of scientific research between the two countries; and limiting the number of Chinese students studying in the United States. Democrats, meanwhile, were by and large opposed to all three proposals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a long-term foreign policy goal, curbing China’s influence also ranks as a higher priority for rank-and-file Republicans than Democrats: 63 percent of Republicans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think that the U.S. should make it a top priority to limit the power and influence</a> of China, while just 36 percent of Democrats agree. To that end, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/14/members-of-congress-especially-republicans-are-increasingly-discussing-china-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew found in a July report</a> that members of Congress — particularly Republicans — grew more outspoken about China on social media in 2020, often using accusatory language surrounding the pandemic or intellectual property theft. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The biggest difference [between Biden and Trump on China] is that the Trump administration was more unilateralist and even weakened some of our alliances and partnerships, but the Biden administration has come in determined to build coalitions with the countries that share our values and interests,” said <a href="https://www.gmfus.org/find-experts/bonnie-s-glaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bonnie Glaser</a>, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet still, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de6a5d8d-3745-4b07-96ff-0a0d59380f9e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some have argued</a> that an ascendant China <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/opinion/china-economy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be just the kickstart</a> that America <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-12-03/china-challenge-can-help-america-avert-decline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needs</a> to escape an era of hyper-partisanship. But though there is significant room for bipartisan agreement on some of the issues surrounding China in American politics, it is not clear that this is enough for U.S.-China relations to really become a bipartisan issue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.rachelmyrick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel Myrick</a>, a professor of political science at Duke University, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/abs/do-external-threats-unite-or-divide-security-crises-rivalries-and-polarization-in-american-foreign-policy/85C21E7EBD9EB38EDDB95F68A0458A88" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has found in her research</a> that security threats from foreign foes don’t consistently reduce polarization. Looking across dozens of cases since the start of the 20th century, Myrick found little evidence that such threats reduced polarization; rather, she found that the responses to these threats often reflected already existing partisan dynamics. The assumption that a rising China will bring about domestic unity, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/04/democrats-republicans-seem-agree-about-one-foreign-policy-point-getting-tough-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myrick argued</a> in The Washington Post in June, “may be faulty to begin with.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We shouldn’t expect external threats to inherently be unifying,” Myrick wrote in an email to FiveThirtyEight. “That doesn’t mean, however, that there aren’t some threats that will be. Unsurprisingly, the most unifying threats historically have been severe and direct attacks on American soil. In response to the 9/11 attacks, for example, we saw memorable displays of national unity and a sharp drop in polarization.” But, as Myrick pointed out, those types of galvanizing events are few and far between. “Most security crises involving the U.S. tend to have little to no persistent effects on polarization, either among policymakers or among the American public.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for whether the United States would rally around beating back China the way it did with the Soviet Union after World War II, Myrick is not convinced. She pointed to the differences in the domestic political environment from that era to this one, highlighting that while Republicans and Democrats increasingly see China as a threat, they are divided on how to respond. She also pointed out that the United States is far more enmeshed with China economically than it was with the Soviet Union, and that American competition with China is “much less about military power and much more about economic competition.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the dynamics at play here go beyond the narrow scope of American domestic politics. For instance, a lot has to do with what China itself does — if it keeps using economic and military coercion <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/blinken-warns-chinas-increasingly-aggressive-actions-against-taiwan-2021-04-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toward its neighbors</a>, America's posture <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-china-is-responding-to-escalating-strategic-competition-with-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will likely be adversarial</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some experts do think that the tension between China and the U.S. could have a unifying effect. <a href="https://rhg.com/team/jordan-schneider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordan Schneider</a>, a China technology analyst at the Rhodium Group and host of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/448WaJhgJGJKnQ3HCE2EBa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ChinaTalk podcast</a>, told FiveThirtyEight that increased competition with China on issues like climate change is such an example. “If everyone agrees climate change is a problem, this could be something that actually boosts China’s image abroad, and the same thing with Biden,” said Schneider. “So you could end up in a Cold War circa 1960s and ’70s dynamic, where it’s actually the tension that helped push forward some human rights changes both in the Soviet Union and in the U.S., more famously with Civil Rights legislation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Myrick, too, acknowledges there will be <em>some</em> opportunities for bipartisan cooperation on various aspects of U.S.-China policy. “I think we’ll see a fair amount of bipartisanship in the short term on aspects of technology competition, for example.” But she did stress that “[e]xpecting a growing ‘China threat’ to resolve partisan divisions in American politics seems misguided.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of that is to say that even on the issues that Americans seem the least politically divided on, existing partisan polarization is still likely to rule the day — if not factors outside of most Americans’ control. And if the past two decades of foreign policy are any lesson, there’s nothing that says that America's current bipartisan consensus on China is stable — or that it will lead to a less divided United States. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a lot going on in Congress this week, and much of it is existential. The House is scheduled to vote on a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill on Thursday. But some Democratic lawmakers said they wouldn’t vote for the bill without an agreement on a multi-trillion-dollar partisan social programs bill. At the same time, the U.S. risks defaulting on its debt as Republicans refuse to help raise the debt ceiling. Oh, and the government might shut down by week’s end, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew talks about the threat of a government shutdown and how likely they think it will be for Democrats to get their agenda passed on both spending plans, immigration reform and voting rights.

			<title>Texas’s New Congressional Map Could Give A Huge Boost To GOP Incumbents</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, Texas lawmakers <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave a first glimpse</a> at what the state’s new congressional districts may look like. The redrawn map was highly anticipated given that Texas gained two additional congressional seats — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most of any state</a> — during the reapportionment process and because Republicans are fully in control of the state’s redistricting process. Yet the new map, if passed, would not substantially alter the topline partisan breakdown of Texas’s seats. It appears that Republican mapmakers prioritized defending the GOP’s current seat advantage over trying to significantly expand it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/draft_plan_1/"><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TX-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TX-Screenshot-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TX-Screenshot-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TX-Screenshot-1.png?w=1400 2x"></a></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Overall, this map creates 24 solid or likely Republican seats, 13 solid or likely Democratic seats and one swing seat in the Rio Grande Valley. (The state’s two new districts will be placed in the Austin and Houston <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/11/analysis-blue-dots-texas-red-political-sea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metropolitan areas</a>, as those two areas fueled much of the state’s population growth since 2010.) But this isn’t <em>that</em> much different than what Texas’s map currently looks like: At present, the delegation is made up of 23 Republicans and 13 Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is still a very good map for Republicans, though, because mapmakers strengthened the GOP’s advantage in the state by making a number of potentially vulnerable seats held by Republicans much redder, with the newest Houston-area seat also drawn so that it’s favorable to Republican candidates. As the table below shows, the current map has 11 Republican incumbents in seats that were less than 20 points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> But on the new map, all but one Republican-held seat would be R+20 or stronger for the GOP.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Given that the GOP controls the redistricting process in Texas, it might seem strange that it wasn’t more aggressive in trying to flip a seat or two held by Democrats. But population growth and demographic shifts in Texas <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-america-lost-and-gained-population-could-throw-democrats-a-redistricting-lifeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have arguably benefited Democrats</a> so significantly that Republican mapmakers were mostly left playing defense — concerned that some GOP incumbents might soon become vulnerable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the top of that list is Rep. Beth Van Duyne, the only Texas Republican defending a seat that President Biden carried in 2020. The new map lines, however, would shift Van Duyne’s district between Dallas and Fort Worth nearly 20 points to the right, meaning that she likely has far more to worry about in a primary than in a general election now after winning by only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-texas-house-district-24.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.3 points</a> last November. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three other Republican incumbents in seats that were less than R+10 also saw their districts move at least 15 points to the right. Rep. Dan Crenshaw ranks among these members, although it’s not clear which seat he may run in: About one-third of his current district is in the new 38th District, but the same is true of the new 2nd District, too, which may also be open, considering Rep. Kevin Brady of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/politics/kevin-brady-retirement/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current 8th District is retiring</a>. Either way, Crenshaw — <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/02/is-dan-crenshaw-the-future-of-the-gop-225257/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rising star in the GOP</a> — would be far safer than he is now. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Tony Gonzales of the 23rd District is the only Republican incumbent who wouldn’t end up in a seat that’s at least R+20, but his perennial battleground district would be reforged into a relative GOP stronghold: His district would be R+13 under the new lines. Like Van Duyne, Gonzalez would breathe far easier under this new map, after he only won by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-texas-house-district-23.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 points</a> in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In order to make many of these seats safer for Republicans, GOP lawmakers moved more Democratic voters into seats that the <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2021/08/24/lizzie-fletcher-and-colin-allred-are-doomed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP had previously targeted</a> but now seem to have abandoned. For example, the seat held by Democrat Lizzie Fletcher, who <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/06/democrat-lizzie-fletcher-against-texas-gop-congressman-john-culberson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unseated a Republican incumbent</a> in 2018, would go from D+1 to D+25. Meanwhile, the Dallas-area seat represented by Democrat Colin Allred, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/06/democrat-colin-allred-leads-gop-congressman-pete-sessions-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who similarly ousted</a> a Republican incumbent in 2018, would go from D+2 to D+25. It’s a similar story for almost every other Texas Democrat under this plan. (In some instances, Republican mapmakers also made some super-red seats a slightly paler shade, “unpacking” some GOP voters to boost Republican-held seats. For instance, Rep. Van Taylor’s 3rd District outside of Dallas shifted east to take some red turf from Rep. Pat Fallon’s 4th District.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the biggest takeaways from this map is that almost every seat — Democratic or Republican — would be uncompetitive at its baseline. All but two seats would lean at least 10 points more Democratic or Republican than the country as a whole. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s heavily Hispanic South Texas that holds both of those exceptions. This is a potentially important development as that region might hold opportunities for the GOP since Biden performed <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/04/joe-biden-texas-border-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worse there than past Democratic presidential candidates</a>. Most notably, the 15th District, represented by Democrat Vicente Gonzalez, would become more Republican-leaning on the new map. He was already facing a difficult reelection bid, as he narrowly won his 2020 race by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-texas-house-district-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 percentage points</a> after winning reelection by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-house-district-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 points in 2018</a>. But now under the new map, his district would go from D+2 to evenly split. Meanwhile, Rep. Henry Cuellar’s 28th District would actually become slightly bluer — it only moved from D+4 to D+7 — and could be in play in 2022. (Rep. Filemon Vela’s 34th District doesn’t fall neatly into this category because it went from D+5 to D+17, but it is the other border seat in Texas, and it seems to have gotten a little friendlier toward Democrats, although Vela <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/22/texas-filemon-vela-retirement-477441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t seek reelection</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another notable change under the new map is that it would result in a smaller share of districts with Hispanic majorities despite the addition of two new congressional districts. This could make the map vulnerable to a racial gerrymandering lawsuit considering Texas’s Hispanic population has <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/12/texas-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driven the bulk of Texas’s population growth</a> since 2010. According to census data, the current congressional map included 18 districts with white majorities and nine with Hispanic majorities. But the newly proposed map doesn’t give Hispanic voters any more clout: There are now 19 districts that have white majorities and still nine districts with Hispanic majorities, based on the voting age population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is only the first draft of Texas’s new congressional map, so it could still change before it’s passed by the GOP-controlled legislature. The Senate Redistricting Committee is <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1442570463155302408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to take up</a> the congressional map on Thursday. But remember the GOP ultimately controls the redistricting process in Texas. That said, <a href="https://www.senate.mn/departments/scr/REDIST/Redsum/txsum.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past congressional maps</a> proposed by Texas lawmakers <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/texas/?cycle=2020&amp;level=Congress&amp;startdate=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been endlessly litigated</a> — and it’s possible that <a href="https://twitter.com/marceelias/status/1442535597336190979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could happen again</a> this time around.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When the suburban Chicago hospital where her mother was being treated for COVID-19 refused to give her ivermectin, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-libertyville-hospital-covid-lawsuit-patient-ivermectin-20210922-g7tjh2sm3fdablpbzomuv26vvu-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiffany Wilson had her moved to another hospital</a>. The antiparasitic drug achieved a cult following as a treatment for COVID-19, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-to-stop-hoping-for-a-covid-19-miracle-cure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite no current evidence</a> it is effective. But that didn’t deter Wilson from suing when the next hospital also refused to give her mother, 68-year-old Leslie Pai, ivermectin. And she won. This week, after the hospital obliged a judge’s injunction ordering it to give Pai ivermectin, Pai’s heart rate plummeted, hospital doctors said in court documents. The hospital pushed back in court, and <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-ivermectin-covid-lawsuit-dropped-libertyville-hospital-20210923-lqwfwls5orcqvdxfjk3lgtyale-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilson dropped the case</a>, with her lawyers asking the court to lift the injunction while continuing to argue that the ivermectin was, in fact, helping. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s most remarkable about Wilson’s story is that it’s not the only one of its kind. In recent months, there have been multiple cases of patients or their families demanding ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19, not only going to court but also harassing hospital staff. And in at least seven instances, judges have granted these requests, ordering hospitals to either administer the drug or allow other physicians into the facility to administer it. These incidents mark a new era of the pandemic: As hospitals struggle under the weight of new COVID-19 cases, they are also being forced to fight this new battle spurred by an avalanche of fear and online misinformation. The infodemic has officially arrived in the ICU. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’ve never encountered this and I’ve been in practice over 40 years,” said Dr. Rodney Hood, who chairs the National Medical Association’s COVID-19 Task Force on Vaccines and Therapeutics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some instances, hospitals refusing to treat patients with ivermectin have faced <a href="https://newstalk941.com/crmc-responds-to-protest-wanting-alternate-covid-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests</a>. One case in particular garnered a sizable public response. In 2016, Veronica Wolski, then a 59-year-old Chicagoan, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-bernie-sanders-bridge-chicago-inc-20161011-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first drew public attention</a> when she waved Bernie Sanders signs from a pedestrian bridge over a highway. Over the last five years, her occupation of the bridge continued but her message shifted to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepeoplesbridge/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote the QAnon conspiracy theory</a>, the Big Lie and anti-vaccine sentiments — endearing her to the alt-right. And then recently, after Wolski was hospitalized with COVID-19, supporters on QAnon-focused Telegram channels shared contact information for the hospital and began a campaign of calling and emailing to demand Wolski receive ivermectin. This was amplified when L. Lin Wood, the pro-Trump lawyer who filed a number of lawsuits challenging the 2020 election results, got involved, encouraging his followers to do the same.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood also shared a video of himself calling the hospital and warning that the staff would be “guilty of murder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> The <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/amita-hospital-targeted-with-hundreds-of-emails-calls-after-denying-patient-controversial-drug/2607957/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital reported hundreds of emails and calls</a> “associated with one patient’s care,” and there was <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/9/7/22661430/chicago-coronavirus-qanon-supporters-protest-amita-resurrection-hospital-ivermectin-patient" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even an in-person protest</a>.

<p data-paragraph="main">Along with demands and protests over ivermectin, there have been multiple cases of individuals suing hospitals to force them to treat a COVID-19 patient with the drug. In more than one case, these lawsuits have been successful. A <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-elmhurst-hospital-covid-ivermectin-lawsuit-20210503-odktw5zntnarhnyvdemjbr2xfy-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judge in Illinois</a> (separate from the Wilson case) ordered a hospital to allow a patient with COVID-19 to receive ivermectin after her daughter sued for the treatment. In at least two cases in New York, <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/2nd-wny-hospital-ordered-to-treat-covid-19-patient-with-experimental-drug/article_f32339f0-5d01-11eb-b752-4f8966804581.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judges made similar orders</a>. In Ohio, <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/08/30/judge-orders-cinci-hospital-to-treat-covid-19-patient-with-ivermectin-despite-cdc-warnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a judge ordered a hospital to administer</a> ivermectin to a patient with COVID-19 after his wife sued, but then a different judge <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/09/06/judge-reverses-order-forcing-hospital-to-give-ivermectin-to-covid-19-patient/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned that order.</a> Similar cases have been brought forward in <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/09/22/california-woman-wants-hospital-ordered-to-give-ivermectin-to-her-husband-a-covid-19-patient/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a>, <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/kentucky-hospital-doesn-t-have-to-give-patient-ivermectin-judge-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky</a>, <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/article_6fe39414-05ed-11ec-b7da-db4559be0604.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana</a>, <a href="https://www.wdel.com/news/lawsuit-seeks-to-force-christianacare-to-administer-ivermectin-to-man-dying-of-covid/article_bb8fc6a8-1a29-11ec-a45a-3f37133b6501.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delaware</a> and <a href="https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/74-year-old-covid-patients-family-says-hospital-refused-court-order-to-give-ivermectin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas</a>. (Many of these cases have even been brought forward by the same lawyer, as first <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lawyer-ralph-lorigo-forces-ivermectin-on-hospitals-as-covid-treatment-and-drives-doctors-crazy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by the Daily Beast</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fixation on ivermectin is largely driven by online misinformation and a misrepresentation of what we know about the drug. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic that has been around for decades and is very effective at treating certain <em>parasitic</em> infections, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/onchocerciasis/treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like river blindness</a>. Its effectiveness on viral infections, particularly COVID-19, is still being investigated. Unfortunately, there’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-to-stop-hoping-for-a-covid-19-miracle-cure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not yet good evidence showing it’s effective</a> in this case, and one of the biggest papers suggesting it could be effective <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/16/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was withdrawn due to ethical conflicts</a>. That said, it’s not as if ivermectin has been written off; clinical trials to test ivermectin’s effectiveness against COVID-19 are ongoing, and their results will be carefully monitored by federal agencies and professional groups that help create guidelines for treatment. That same process has led to other existing drugs, like <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fdas-approval-veklury-remdesivir-treatment-covid-19-science-safety-and-effectiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the antiviral remdesivir</a>, getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treating COVID-19. But neither the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDA</a> nor the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-advises-that-ivermectin-only-be-used-to-treat-covid-19-within-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a> nor the <a href="https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Institutes of Health</a> currently approve of ivermectin for treating COVID-19. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But misinformation has convinced many people that they know more about how to treat COVID-19 than the medical establishment and experts. The thing is, they don’t. “The number of studies and the quality of them and the different research methodologies in any field of medicine is always pretty overwhelming. That’s why we have professional societies and regulatory bodies who take all of that evidence into consideration,” said Carolyn Bramante, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota and the principal investigator on an <a href="https://covidout.umn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing randomized clinical trial of ivermectin</a> and other potential COVID-19 treatments. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It can, of course, be a good thing for <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/how-to-advocate-for-yourself-as-a-pregnant-black-woman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patients to advocate for their own care</a>. The difference in ivermectin cases is that their advocacy is based on rumors and lies, not on scientific evidence. Though ivermectin has been around for decades, it’s still a drug and it can have side effects and potentially negative impacts, Bramante said. Not only is there not yet evidence that it works, we also don’t know if it could be harmful. That can also cause complications for a hospital system already stretched thin by the pandemic it’s trying to treat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You don’t get treated based upon what you feel or think,” Hood said. “There are certain approved treatment regimens for certain diseases. If [what a patient is demanding] doesn’t fit within that regimen, then you cannot treat them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Online, however, proponents of ivermectin <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tout it as both a prophylaxis and a cure</a> for COVID-19, cherry-picking data from preprint studies and sharing anecdotes of miraculous recoveries. It’s an infectious narrative that leads many people to believe the drug ought to be used widely — and to wonder if the fact that it isn’t is evidence of a conspiracy. Amid the desperate haze of the pandemic, this type of thinking is leading people to extreme actions. All this while another preventive medical intervention, one that has been shown to be highly effective and safe — the vaccine — is shunned by many of the same people. These lawsuits may represent a precedent of conspiracy-theory-influenced patients using the courts as a cudgel to force medical professionals to practice against their own expertise. Right now, it’s ivermectin, but what’s stopping patients from demanding to be treated with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/does-colloidal-silver-work-covid-19/613177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colloidal silver</a> or <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/05/cdc-misusing-bleach-try-kill-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bleach</a>?</p>

But at the heart of the chaos is a core disagreement over a basic tenet of governing: Is bipartisanship still possible?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joe-manchin-filibuster-vote/2021/04/07/cdbd53c6-97da-11eb-a6d0-13d207aadb78_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sens. Joe Manchin</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/21/kyrsten-sinema-filibuster-for-the-people-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyrsten Sinema</a> certainly both think it is. They are so strong in their commitment to working across party lines that they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/filibuster-vote-count/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand alone</a> among Democratic senators in objecting to changing the filibuster. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But they are lone voices for a reason: The political environment most senators inhabit makes public bipartisanship anywhere from difficult to politically suicidal. This is for a variety of reasons, including that so much of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our politics is now nationalized</a>, that party leaders keep most potential “bipartisan” bills from reaching the floor and, perhaps most importantly, that the national parties are now geographically isolated, meaning there’s minimal overlap in the interests and values the parties represent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is, of course, not limited to the Senate, but for the purposes of this article, I’m focusing primarily on how bipartisanship has largely disappeared from the Senate, as that’s historically where more bipartisanship has taken place.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">To understand why a senator like Manchin is such a strong and singular proponent of bipartisanship, it helps to understand just how rare a senator like him is. He is one of just six senators who represent a state that voted for the other party in the most recent presidential election — and one of just two senators whose state voted for the other<em> </em>party’s presidential nominee by at least 10 points in 2020.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six senators are: Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Ron Johnson and Pat Toomey; and Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin, Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester. And Tester is the senator other than Manchin to represent a state that voted for the other party’s presidential nominee by at least 10 points in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

Between 1960 and 1990, roughly half of all sitting senators fit into this group. But over the last three decades, that number has plummeted, as the chart above shows.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, in an earlier political era, many senators shared their state with a senator from the opposite party. Not only did this serve to reinforce the electoral reality that either party could win a state, but it also gave such senators an obvious bipartisan partner in the Senate, particularly on issues of concern to their home state. Today, though, only 12 senators — the six senators mentioned above, plus the fellow senator in their state<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you count Sen. Angus King as a Democrat. King, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, is one of two independent senators in Congress who caucus with the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> — have a colleague who’s from the other party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">So, what changed? Well, pretty much the entire nature of American electoral party politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One way to clearly see this change is to map American partisan competition. From the 1960s through the early 2000s, both Democrats and Republicans were genuinely national parties in the Senate. That is, Senate Democrats and Republicans used to hail from all parts of the country. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1148" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drutman.BIPARTISANSHIP-DEAD.0927-3-desktop.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drutman.BIPARTISANSHIP-DEAD.0927-3-desktop.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drutman.BIPARTISANSHIP-DEAD.0927-3-desktop.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drutman.BIPARTISANSHIP-DEAD.0927-3-desktop.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="2798" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drutman.BIPARTISANSHIP-DEAD.0927-3-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drutman.BIPARTISANSHIP-DEAD.0927-3-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drutman.BIPARTISANSHIP-DEAD.0927-3-mobile.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/drutman.BIPARTISANSHIP-DEAD.0927-3-mobile.png?w=1240 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This was important because it kept both parties politically diverse and thus moderate overall. Moreover, because Senate elections were more about local issues, both parties were able to compete nationally. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629805000260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voters didn’t care as much</a> whether they sent a Democrat or a Republican to Washington. What mattered was whether they sent somebody who could represent their state well. And senators could prove their worth by <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674493285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing home federal funding for roads and bridges</a> — just the kind of issue that used to facilitate bipartisan dealmaking.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But today’s political campaigns and voters care far less about roads and bridges. They care far more about national culture-war issues — <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo27596045.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and which party controls the majority in Congress</a>. As a result, Democrats can’t win in much of the Southeast and the Mountain West, and Republicans are now perpetual losers in the West and the Northeast. Only the Southwest and the Midwest remain competitive, and that’s only because state populations are currently balanced between liberal cities and conservative exurbs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also why bipartisanship in the Senate is waning. Republican senators in solidly Republican states do not have to worry about winning over <em>some</em> Democrats; the senators’ general election win is all but assured. Rather, the most likely way they could lose is if they face a primary challenge to their right. And the most likely way they could draw such a challenger is if they were to publicly work with Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, a bipartisan record has become a liability in today’s electoral environment.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Even in competitive states, a bipartisan record is no guarantee of electoral success. Take former Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado. His attempt to <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/news/gardner-again-rated-among-the-u-s-senates-most-bipartisan-members/article_44220102-58d4-11ea-ba49-4f3fb74eab48.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prove his bipartisan bona fides</a> in his reelection bid in 2020 ultimately proved no match for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a state that is continuing to trend blue</a>. And we saw the same fate recently befall three Democratic senators of increasingly red states: Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill. All were sunk in 2018 by the “D” attached to their name. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Swing states (and swing districts) also <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/geography-uncertainty-and-polarization/4BF8B48947D113D85662123D207D3418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t have more swing voters than anywhere else</a>; in fact, they might have fewer, since many swing states are only swingy because their populations are evenly balanced between very liberal cities and very conservative exurbs. Consider Georgia: Despite <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/georgia-senate-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a closely contested runoff</a> for both of the state’s Senate races, none of the candidates really tried to run to the middle. It’s a similar story in Wisconsin. It’s <a href="https://www.wuwm.com/2021-08-30/sen-ron-johnson-sounds-like-a-2022-candidate-but-says-he-isnt-one-yet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unclear</a> yet whether Republican Sen. Ron Johnson will run for reelection in 2022, but if he does, he has also chosen to double down on his party’s strategy (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/15/ron-johnson-trump-political-future-445871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embracing former President Trump</a>) versus trying to persuade voters in the middle — even though Wisconsin voted for Biden in 2020 (albeit narrowly). More broadly, the electoral penalty for extremism has <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined considerably in recent years</a>, as the political middle has become a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-moderate-middle-is-a-myth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">muddled vacuum</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even for senators who want to publicly prove their bipartisan bona fides, the problem is that party leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell prefer <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo24732099.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">votes that draw sharp contrasts</a> between the two parties. Divisive partisan politics <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mann-and-Corrad_Party-Polarization-and-Campaign-Finance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help with campaign fundraising</a> in an era of increasingly ideological donors (both big and small). And high-stakes elections <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/10/high-turnout-2020-wasnt-good-american-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobilize and excite voters</a>. Bipartisanship, in contrast, muddles the stakes and blurs the lines. What about infrastructure, you say? After all, that is the one big-ticket issue this year where there has been at least <em>some</em> very public bipartisanship. Is West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, right <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/filibuster-senate-infrastructure-deal_n_61088eeee4b039aafa0e3de1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when she says</a>, “What you see is when we work together and really put the nose to the grindstone, we can get bipartisan support to move forward. That’s what the bipartisan group did, so I think it blunts the argument on the filibuster”?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, if there were ever an issue where Congress should be able to be bipartisan, it would be an issue like infrastructure. In the good old days of bipartisanship, infrastructure would have been an easy bipartisan win; every senator would get some money to spend on their state’s roads and bridges, thus allowing them to tout their home-state spending for their next reelection. Big appropriations bills, stuffed full of earmarks, have long been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/earmarks-biden-infrastructure/2021/03/21/5a9d15ca-88c6-11eb-bfdf-4d36dab83a6d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a path to bipartisan agreement</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet, for four years, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/coronavirus-infrastructure-week-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perpetual</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/trump-infrastructure-week.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joke</a> in Washington was that it was always “<a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/infrastructure-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infrastructure week</a>.” Certainly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/infrastructure-bill-passes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden worked harder</a> than Trump to foster a bipartisan deal. But <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/08/bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-win-biden-senate-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguably</a>, it was the Democrats’ threat of eliminating the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation that pushed McConnell into supporting a bipartisan agreement in a way that bolstered Sinema and Manchin’s faith in bipartisanship. This is hardly a sustainable formula for bipartisan dealmaking on major issues.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Congress can still accomplish some lower-profile bipartisan lawmaking (like a <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/senate-adopts-drinking-water-and-3848959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent major upgrade</a> of our drinking-water and wastewater systems) through what Matthew Yglesias and Simon Bazelon have dubbed “<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-rise-and-importance-of-secret" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret Congress</a>.” It turns out that members of Congress can still work across party lines when issues are relatively noncontroversial and there is not much media attention.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, if you look beyond the partisan media’s name-calling, you can find surprising amounts of bipartisan activity, as political scientist Laurel Harbridge-Yong showed in her 2015 book “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/is-bipartisanship-dead/38C076985676827938D3FD9731D0D28A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is Bipartisanship Dead?</a>” The same is true in a <a href="https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/working-papers/2021/wp-21-08.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more recent working paper</a> by Harbridge-Yong and fellow political scientists Craig Volden and Alan Wiseman. They found that lawmakers who cosponsor more bipartisan bills are more effective in passing legislation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But “Secret Congress” works only because it’s secret, and it’s secret only because the issues are not high-profile enough to draw the public spotlight. But if the only bipartisanship that happens in Congress happens on uncontroversial one-off issues, this leaves the most important issues of the day to wither on the shoals of a 60-vote threshold in the Senate or, more commonly, in the gridlock of a divided government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, most Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-sad-about-politics-who-could-blame-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are sick of all the partisan fighting in Washington</a>. They are, in one widely cited phrasing, part of <a href="https://hiddentribes.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “exhausted majority”</a> — i.e., the two-thirds of Americans who are “fed up with the polarization plaguing American government and society.” Most Americans also say they want <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-americans-really-care-about-bipartisanship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compromise and bipartisanship</a>, though that desire for compromise is conditional — most Americans still prefer that their party win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X18799273" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisans are the most hostile to compromise</a> — especially those individuals whose racial, religious and cultural identities line up most strongly with one party. But the partisan sorting that has aligned these identities so closely with one party over the last several decades is precisely the reason why voters have come down so hard on politicians who compromise. The more that national political conflict is centered on abstract moral issues and the identity of the nation, the more any compromise feels like a surrender.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To recreate the conditions that allowed bipartisanship to flourish in the Senate once upon a time seems unlikely anytime soon. Instead, the most bipartisan-oriented senators are the most endangered. Manchin is a dying breed. His eventual replacement in West Virginia will almost certainly be a Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There may also be moments when the incentives align to navigate an occasional bipartisan deal that can get 60 votes in the Senate, especially on issues that are less covered and therefore lower-profile. But more likely is that the rewards for demonstrating party loyalty will remain stronger than the rewards for trying to be bipartisan, and that the disagreements dividing Republicans and Democrats will stay centered on issues like immigration, democracy and racial justice, where compromise is all but impossible in a binary politics system defined by these conflicts. Certainly, a few senators may still value bipartisanship for intrinsic reasons. But when almost all the structural political pressures are stacked against bipartisanship, American politics — and especially the Senate — will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remain stuck</a> for the foreseeable future.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">It might be an off-year election cycle in the U.S., but September has been full of high-profile elections. First we had the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California recall election</a>, then <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-things-to-watch-in-canadas-big-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada’s parliamentary election</a> this past Monday. And on Sunday, Germany will go to the polls to decide the makeup of its parliament’s lower chamber, the Bundestag. Those results will determine who leads Germany’s government, and importantly, that individual won’t be long-time Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is stepping down after nearly 16 years in charge.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race to replace Merkel <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-why-many-voters-are-still-undecided/a-59251080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be very uncertain</a>, too, because <a href="https://zweitstimme.org/en/posts/forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no one party looks likely</a> to win a large plurality of seats, much less a majority. That means the next government, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/a-history-of-germanys-coalition-governments/g-41818483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like every one in Germany since World War II</a>, will likely be a coalition of at least two parties — and quite possibly a third. And while the leader of the party that wins the most seats often ends up as chancellor, that’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/10/06/schmidt-is-big-victor-in-balloting/939e74c6-f180-47d4-a8d5-d2a969850ab7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not always the case</a>. In all likelihood, though, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56821462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next chancellor</a> will come from <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/cdu-csu-spd-afd-fdp-left-greens/a-38085900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Germany’s two major parties</a>: either the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) helmed by Olaf Scholz, or Merkel’s party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), now led by Armin Laschet. However, there is a small chance that Annalena Baerbock of The Greens, a left-leaning, environmentally conscious party, could also lead the next government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most <a href="https://pollytix.eu/pollytix-german-election-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling averages</a> show <a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2021-08/sonntagsfrage-bundestagswahl-2021-bundeskanzler-koalition-umfragen?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tight race</a> with a <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly fragmented vote</a> across <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany’s seven notable parties</a>. The SPD has been on the rise since late July and now leads in the polls with just around 25 percent, thanks in part to Scholz’s status as the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aT2f8yc8p9-XjOqFCTQ1nDeP5GEORu9QZDOtUwF8smI/edit#gid=1579897364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular choice</a> among German voters to be the next chancellor. Next up is the CDU and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU),<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/where-do-they-stand-a-quick-guide-to-germany-s-political-parties-a-651388.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The CSU&lt;/a&gt; operates only in the state of Bavaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>23</sup></a> which together have seen their polling numbers fall into the low 20s as Laschet has <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/conservative-laschet-struggles-momentum-german-121328724.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received negative reviews</a> for his performance in debates and on the campaign trail. The Greens, who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/germanys-greens-were-riding-high-in-the-polls-but-fell-from-grace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held a small lead in the polls back in the spring</a>, are now at around 15 percent. Three other parties are polling above the 5 percent threshold necessary to make it into the Bundestag (more on that cut-off later), although only two are potential coalition partners: The <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/classical_liberalism.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classically liberal</a> Free Democratic Party (FDP) is polling at about 11 percent, while the left-wing and aptly named The Left Party is polling at about 6 percent. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-far-right-afd-alternative-for-germany-2021-election-results/a-57054532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The far-right and xenophobic</a> Alternative for Germany (AfD) is actually polling higher than The Left at around 11 percent, but Germany’s other parties <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-real-choice-on-election-day-jamaica-kenya-or-mickey-mouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have ruled out</a> forming <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cordon_sanitaire_(politics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a governing coalition with the AfD</a> because of its extreme views.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/spot-gerrymandering-state-fivethirtyeight-80189920</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Yet there’s reason to be a tad worried about the state of the polls in Germany. The Washington Post’s Lenny Bronner <a href="https://twitter.com/lennybronner/status/1438940392758652932?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently found</a> there’s a strong likelihood pollsters are “herding,” which is the tendency for pollsters to produce results that are too similar to one another. Bronner noticed that the shares the SPD and AfD have received in polls are <em>very</em> consistent across pollsters — in fact, in all likelihood <em>too</em> consistent. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-some-pollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we’ve found at FiveThirtyEight</a>, herding can be especially common at the end of the campaign, perhaps because pollsters are afraid of producing outliers that go against the rest of the field. But the unfortunate upshot is that herding often leads pollsters to underestimate some parties’ support and, in turn, leads election forecasters to underestimate the uncertainty in the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even with this concern, however, there is clearly no party flying high in the polls, which makes it difficult to say with any certainty what the eventual governing coalition will look like in Germany. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/jamaica-traffic-lights-or-kiwis-germanys-coalition-conundrum-2021-09-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germans like to name potential governing coalitions</a> after things that <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2021-governing-coalition-options/g-59031537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match the colors of their respective parties</a>, so bearing that in mind, the two most likely coalitions at this point are probably a left-leaning “traffic light” government formed by the SPD (which uses red as its color), the FDP (yellow) and The Greens (no explanation needed), or a right-leaning “Jamaica” government formed by the CDU/CSU (black), the FDP and the Greens. However, each of those coalitions would include a party that doesn’t comfortably align ideologically — the FDP in the former, The Greens in the latter — which could complicate coalition negotiations. In 2017, for instance, efforts to put together a “Jamaica” coalition <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-preliminary-coalition-talks-collapse-after-fdp-walks-out/a-41445987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell apart</a>. And while the business-friendly FDP could join a “traffic light” coalition, FDP leader Christian Lindner has said he wants <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/23/germany-election-chancellor-laschet-scholz-lindner-global-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control over the finance ministry</a> in exchange for helping Scholz become chancellor, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/we-want-increase-investment-germany-fdp-leader-says-2021-09-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be a hurdle</a> for the SPD and The Greens since having the FDP in that position could limit how much they can <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-19/germany-s-scholz-lays-down-rules-for-any-future-coalition-ally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise taxes</a> and expand deficit spending.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why other coalition options could come into play, including an “R2G” (red, red, green) coalition made up of the SPD, The Left and The Greens. In the final days of the campaign, Merkel <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-election-2021-red-scare-angela-merkel-cdu-armin-laschet-spd-olaf-scholz-greens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has voiced fears about the possibility of a left-wing government</a>, arguing it would turn the country away from the moderate course she’s pursued over the past decade and a half. And The Left does have some views that could make an all-left coalition untenable, including a <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-left-party-plans-to-scrap-nato-end-troop-deployments/a-57973017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desire to leave NATO</a> and a lingering connection to old Communist East Germany. Some additional coalitions include a “Germany” coalition of the CDU/CSU, SPD and FDP or a larger “Kenya” coalition of the CDU/CSU, SPD and The Greens. There could even be a renewal of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-election/german-spd-aims-for-post-merkel-government-without-her-conservatives-idUSKBN2B70WV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current “grand coalition” government of the CDU/CSU and SPD</a>, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But OK, that’s <em>a lot</em> of potential coalitions. Let’s talk about how the German electoral system works — as that’s why so many different coalitions are possible. Elections for the Bundestag <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/48997/1/311685250.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combine the principles</a> of proportional and district-level representation, so <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/parliament/elections/arithmetic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germans actually cast two votes</a> at the ballot box: one for a local candidate and one for a party, which allows voters to potentially split their ticket between parties. The first vote functions similarly to most elections in the U.S.: The candidate with the most votes in each of Germany’s 299 single-member districts wins the seat. But the second vote is more important, as it determines the proportional share of seats each party will have in the Bundestag once all is said and done. The 299 district-level members are joined <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/23/how-do-germanys-elections-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by at least another 299 members elected from a ranked list of candidates</a> submitted by each party ahead of the election, with each party gaining whatever number of candidates from the party list it needs to reach its proportional share of seats based on the second vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as mentioned earlier, a party must win at least 5 percent of the party-preference vote, or win at least three single-member districts, to gain proportional representation in the Bundestag.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, a party can win one or two single-member seats to make it into parliament, but it would not be eligible to gain proportional representation based on its party-preference vote share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> However, there is one last wrinkle in Germany’s electoral system: It is possible for a party to win more single-members seats than it is entitled to based on its party-preference vote. When this happens, the Bundestag expands beyond its 598 seats by adding even more members from party lists to ensure each party’s seat total aligns with its party-preference vote share. After the 2017 election, for instance, the Bundestag ended up with 709 total seats, 111 more than its base number, and some projections suggest the Bundestag <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-real-choice-on-election-day-jamaica-kenya-or-mickey-mouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be even larger after the 2021 election</a> to ensure proportionality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into Sunday, it looks like an unpredictable race, with perhaps an even more uncertain coalition-building process to follow. But one thing is certain: This election will mark the end of a distinct era in German and European politics. That’s because Merkel, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/business/merkel-economy-germany-elections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longtime force of stability and leadership</a> in her country, and for the European Union more broadly, is exiting the stage. Merkel, who was sometimes called “<a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/politico50/angela-merkel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leader of the free world</a>” during Donald Trump’s presidency because of his isolationist bent, was the <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/angela-merkel-becomes-chancellor-of-germany" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first woman</a> to serve as Germany’s chancellor, and she <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-angela-merkel-becomes-second-longest-serving-chancellor/a-51773216" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranks high among the country’s longest-serving leaders</a>. Whoever has the job next will have big shoes to fill.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/supreme-court-sets-arguments-big-abortion-case-80131153">announced on Monday</a> that it will hear a case in December concerning a Mississippi abortion law that challenges Roe v. Wade. Mississippi’s 2018 law bans most abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy<em>. </em>This case comes as most Americans (62 percent) want the court to leave the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision<em> </em>as is, per a recent <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_092021/">Monmouth University poll</a>. The Mississippi law isn’t the only high-profile law to challenge the right to abortion, either. Earlier in September, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/">the nation’s most restrictive abortion law</a> went into effect in Texas after the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 vote declining to pause the law while lower courts continue to rule on its constitutionality. Overall, Americans’ disapproval rating of the Supreme Court’s performance (45 percent) is only 3 percentage points higher than approval of the court (42 percent).</li><li>Favorability of the United States has fallen in France after Australia pulled out of a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/19/1038746061/submarine-deal-us-uk-australia-france">$66 billion submarine deal</a>. Australia canceled this contract with France in favor of partnering with the United States and the United Kingdom instead. Upset by this deal, France withdrew its ambassadors from the U.S. and Australia. And, per a recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/20/france-us-favorability-submarine-polling/">Morning Consult poll</a>, favorable views of the U.S. have since slipped in France from 49 percent to 44 percent. However, U.S. popularity among Australians has increased by 2 points with 51 percent of Australians now viewing the U.S. favorably, according to the same poll.</li><li>President Biden announced on Wednesday that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-general-assembly-joe-biden-pandemics-business-united-nations-e7c09c1f896d83c0ed80513082787bd3">the U.S. is doubling its purchase of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines</a> to donate to lower-income countries. Forty-nine percent of Americans say that providing COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries is important (although not a top priority), per a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/09/15/majority-in-u-s-says-public-health-benefits-of-covid-19-restrictions-worth-the-costs-even-as-large-shares-also-see-downsides/#few-americans-know-access-to-vaccines-is-limited-in-developing-countries">Pew Research Center poll</a>. Meanwhile, the Biden administration also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/health/cdc-booster-panel.html">wants to roll out Pfizer booster shots for U.S. adults</a>, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-203d8c288858e815175880753cbc9b8f">only high risk adults and those over 65 receive a third dose</a>. This has been tricky for the Biden administration to navigate as only <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL">32 percent</a> of the world is fully vaccinated, but most vaccinated Americans (62 percent) say they would get a booster shot if recommended, according to Pew.</li><li><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/officials-haitian-migrants-released-us-80163717">Thousands of Haitian migrants</a> are trying to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. Many <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/21/what-led-haitian-nationals-migrating-u-s-southern-border/8419170002/">fled to Central and South America</a> after an earthquake in 2010 and are now leaving due to a lack of jobs, but say they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-mexico-texas-caribbean-immigration-56f1f0093039e2a43e128b7ef0015485">don’t feel safe</a> returning to Haiti. Since that disaster, in 2021 alone, a magnitude <a href="https://apnews.com/article/haiti-earthquake-98f06a322e12f732f94485238d13558c">7.2 earthquake struck the southwestern part of the nation</a>, and the country’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/americas/haiti-explainer-jovenel-moise-assassination-cmd-intl/index.html">president was assassinated</a>. Per a recent <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/52_rate_biden_poor_on_immigration">Rasmussen survey</a>, 52 percent of likely U.S. voters think Biden’s response to immigration issues has been poor. Moreover, a majority of voters across the political spectrum — 84 percent of Republicans, 57 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of voters not affiliated with either party — deemed the current immigration situation at the southern U.S. border a crisis. Many respondents (54 percent) blame Biden administration policies for current immigration problems, while only 37 percent place blame on Trump-era policies.</li><li>On Tuesday, world leaders gathered for the start of the high-level week at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Pressing issues on the agenda included <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-general-assembly-health-china-coronavirus-pandemic-africa-3284c8ff8739dd7cfaf78db214098403">climate change, the pandemic and the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/17/many-people-globally-see-united-nations-in-a-positive-light-including-its-handling-of-climate-change/?utm_content=buffer37fea&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Pew poll</a>, most Americans (59 percent) see the U.N. in a favorable light. Europeans are also largely upbeat on the U.N., with majorities across all nine of the European countries polled feeling favorable toward the organization. Additionally, the U.N.’s response to climate change is mostly favorable around the world. A median of 56 percent of people across the 17 countries surveyed thought the U.N. was doing a good job handling climate change.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<category>California Governor Recall</category>
			<category>COVID-19</category>
			<category>Gavin Newsom</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Last Tuesday’s gubernatorial recall election in California was the campaign that launched a thousand takes: It was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/us/politics/midterms-california-republicans-newsom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good sign for Democrats in 2022</a>; it was a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/18/politics/biden-california-democrats-midterms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good sign for Republicans in 2022</a>. But we at FiveThirtyEight urge far more caution before taking away any national lessons from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s <a href="https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/governor-recall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">victory</a>. To be sure, Newsom’s win was decisive, and with 89 percent of the votes now counted,<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 5:15 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> we can dive a little more into what the results mean. But what they mean is very much up for interpretation — if they mean anything at all. After all, this was just one election and it was conducted under unusual circumstances to boot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One thing we do know is that turnout was <em>really</em> high: More than 13 million people voted.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;a href="https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/status" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;11,690,999&lt;/a&gt; counted ballots, the state estimates there are &lt;a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/statewide-elections/2021-recall/unprocessed-ballot-report.pdf?_ga=2.118328845.504203093.1632146635-284206121.1619718311" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1,381,036&lt;/a&gt; still remaining to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>28</sup></a> That means more than 50 percent of California’s <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2020g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 million eligible voters</a> cast a ballot — a remarkably high turnout rate for an off-year election. In fact, it’s higher than the 49 percent turnout in California’s regularly scheduled 2018 gubernatorial election, which was a <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically high-turnout midterm</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that this eye-popping figure means the high level of interest voters had in the previous two elections (the 2020 election had the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest turnout</a> for a presidential election in over a century) is here to stay. But there are also other possible explanations for the recall’s high turnout. First, under a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-extends-mail-ballots-for-all-voters-15964937.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pandemic-inspired voting law</a>, every registered voter was automatically mailed a ballot — a reform that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/letting-people-vote-at-home-increases-voter-turnout-heres-proof/2018/01/26/d637b9d2-017a-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political scientists say</a> can <a href="https://voteathome.org/research/all-mail-voting-in-colorado-increases-turnout-and-reduces-turnout-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly increase turnout</a>. Second, recall elections may inherently generate a lot of voter interest (which makes sense, given that there needs to be strong grassroots passion on at least one side to force a recall in the first place). In two of the three previous gubernatorial recall elections in U.S. history, turnout was higher than in the respective state’s previous gubernatorial election, though this is admittedly a very small sample size.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The second thing we know about this year’s California recall is that the polls were off by quite a bit. The <a href="https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/governor-recall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recall is currently failing</a> by 26 percentage points (63 percent to 37 percent), and while that margin may tighten a tad more given the <a href="https://twitter.com/sovernnation/status/1440417030461480961?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slight Republican trend in the count</a>, it still marks a substantially more pro-Newsom result than <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/california-recall-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s final recall polling average</a>, which gave keeping Newsom in office a 16-point lead. This 10-point miss was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about twice the size</a> of the average polling error in gubernatorial elections dating back to 1998, and more than twice the size of the polling error in the 2020 presidential election, when Biden led by 8.4 points in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s final polling average</a> but <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won by 4.5 points</a>. Notably, too, unlike the national polls in the 2020 presidential election, the polls in California were biased toward <em>Republicans</em> and not Democrats, which fits into a pattern where polls in very blue states have at times underestimated Democratic performance, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly in the 2016 presidential election</a>. As we’ve noted previously, it’s hard to predict the direction of polling errors because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-updated-our-pollster-ratings-ahead-of-the-2020-general-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their movement is inconsistent</a> from year to year — something to remember in 2022 and 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, we see <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/why-a-troubled-polling-industry-whiffed-on-california-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two broad, potential explanations</a> for this polling error: the difficulty of polling an unusual race like a recall, and/or late movement in voter engagement. There’s also another, simpler story: that the polls were off all along. Regardless, these explanations may all relate to one other. For one thing, pollsters may have struggled to identify who a “likely” voter was in this election; <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-27/likely-california-voters-now-almost-evenly-split-on-newsom-recall-poll-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some surveys found</a> an unusually large gap between the results for likely voters and all registered voters. California normally holds statewide elections in November of even-numbered years, but this was an election in September of an odd-numbered year. Additionally, because every voter received a ballot in the mail, some voters who did not seem likely to vote could have eventually cast a ballot. In that way, higher turnout may have contributed to the polling miss. The polling average also suggested at least some movement toward Newsom’s position after the polls tightened in early August.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may have partly been due to &lt;a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=36cdcb0b-7cfa-4b55-8704-d1f02a9fe6e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an outlier poll from SurveyUSA&lt;/a&gt; that found the recall vote &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; by 11 points, but even with that poll removed from our polling average, opposition to the recall still would have led by only around 4 points in late August, &lt;a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/newsom-clings-to-lead-in-recall-while-crime-becomes-a-top-issue-for-ca-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;as other&lt;/a&gt; polls &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-vaccinated-say-unvaccinated-add-risk-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;still showed&lt;/a&gt; a fairly &lt;a href="https://gravismarketing.com/california-poll-result-gravis-marketing-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;close contest&lt;/a&gt;. SurveyUSA has &lt;a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=f054d152-ceac-48dc-a422-2f22c7a00521" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;since acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that the wording of their likely voter question “may have led some respondents opposed to the recall to misidentify themselves as being unlikely to vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>29</sup></a> It’s possible, then, that a large number of previously unactivated Democratic-leaning Californians could have become engaged and then shown up as likely voters in polls conducted closer to the election, making the late movement not about changing minds about Newsom but about waking up California’s latent Democratic electorate.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Still, despite the polling miss, it would be unfair to cast many aspersions on pollsters. CNN’s Harry Enten <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/03/politics/newsom-rising-polls-recall/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted ahead of the recall</a> that the polling error in the 2003 recall was about 9 points, and the “true” margin of error in polls of recent special elections for the U.S. House (which also occur at odd times of year) <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/01/politics/five-reasons-conor-lamb-could-win/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was around 13 points</a>. Additionally, we perhaps should have expected Newsom to outperform the polls because the status quo — in this case, Newsom staying in office — <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/book/7281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometimes does better</a> than expected in referenda, thanks to a tendency for undecided voters and lower-information voters to vote “no” when faced with a yes-or-no ballot proposition. This is really another reason to be cautious about reading too much into the California result.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also, the degree to which one party overperforms in special elections has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically predicted</a> the national political mood in the next regularly scheduled election, so you <em>could</em> take this recall result to mean that the midterms will be decent for Democrats, or at least better than expected given the tendency of the president’s party to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-that-loses-this-year-could-still-win-a-big-consolation-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose ground in the midterms</a>. But you have to look at the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-special-election-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole body of special elections</a> for that correlation to be reliable. Individual election results can vary due to local factors, and a gubernatorial recall election is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-california-recall-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so unique</a> — almost by definition, some major news controversy must have occurred to even get it on the ballot — that it’s not clear we should read anything national into it. In fact, one way to interpret the result in California is that it was largely in line with the state’s base partisanship. The recall’s 26-point loss was very close to California’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a> of D+25.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also hard to draw too many conclusions about what this means for the pandemic’s effect on elections, either. Despite Republican criticism of Newsom’s handling of the pandemic, an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/14/politics/california-recall-exit-polls/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exit poll of recall voters</a><a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As was true in the &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/exit-polls-can-be-misleading-especially-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, we should be more cautious than usual in interpreting these results. Almost a third of the poll’s respondents were surveyed by phone, text or online (not as they exited a polling place), meaning it’s harder to know whether respondents actually voted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>31</sup></a> found that 47 percent thought Newsom’s coronavirus restrictions were about right, while only 3 in 10 voters felt they were too strict. Moreover, a plurality of voters said the pandemic was their most important issue, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2021/exit-polls/california/recall/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81 percent of them</a> voted to retain Newsom. This is telling in that it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/19/politics/republicans-message-covid-2022/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jibes with other evidence</a> that Republicans aren’t winning over many new voters with their resistance to COVID-19 precautions. Yet it’s also inconclusive as an answer to the question of whether the coronavirus issue will help or hurt Democrats in the midterms. Republicans’ strategy of doubling down on their anti-coronavirus-restrictions base may not be effective, but California also isn’t a great bellwether for the rest of the nation. Voters in a state that blue were probably predisposed to approve of Newsom’s coronavirus restrictions; it also helps that California is making it through the pandemic relatively well (its <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccination-progress-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination rate is high</a> and <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/californias-covid-19-case-rate-is-now-the-lowest-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case rate is low</a>). On the other hand, voters may have different preferences if they live in red Kansas, where Democrats are defending a governor’s seat in 2022, or in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, which Democrats would do well to hold if they want to keep control of the U.S. House. Furthermore, Newsom’s lack of a significant overperformance provides little evidence that COVID-19 will help Democrats win over new voters, either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But here’s the thing about the 2022 midterms: Republicans don’t need a significant shift in the electoral environment to flip the House, considering that Democrats hold only a 222-to-213 seat edge there.<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes three seats that are &lt;a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Members#Vacancies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;currently vacant&lt;/a&gt; but are safe for either party: two for Democrats and one for Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>32</sup></a> For one thing, the GOP will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control the redistricting process for more districts</a> than Democrats, so new map lines alone could <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/redistricting-in-america-part-eight-a-quick-summation-of-a-long-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide Republicans with enough of an edge</a> before we even consider the electoral environment. Newsom’s 26-point win also contains some potentially ominous signs for Democrats. Take Orange County, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pol-orange-county-gop-house-20181117-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ancestral home of the state’s GOP</a> that is now a key swing suburban county. <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?type=county&amp;year=2020&amp;fips=6059&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2020</a>, Biden won Orange County by 9 points, while opposition to the recall <a href="https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/governor-recall/county/orange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads by about 3 points</a> there. And if we dig into two key, swingy House seats <a href="https://voiceofoc.org/2020/11/republicans-flip-second-oc-congressional-seat-as-young-kim-defeats-gil-cisneros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that Republicans flipped in 2020</a>, we see that “yes” on recall leads relatively narrowly in the Orange County portions of California’s 39th Congressional District (by less than 1 point) and 48th Congressional District (by more than 4 points).<a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Monday at 4:51 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>33</sup></a> By comparison, Biden performed about 5 to 6 points better in both districts in 2020, carrying <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yr9mcAtuUdNjI9NEPYKxXsEldzzQ2ZaDwEAbnPRyS4/edit#gid=1938542161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Orange County part</a> of the 39th District by about 5 points and the 48th District (entirely in Orange) by about 1.5 points. These small shifts don’t mean Democrats can’t flip those seats back in 2022 — the lines will change to an unknown extent in redistricting, for one thing — but at the very least, it doesn’t suggest that turf is getting friendlier to them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nonetheless, Orange County’s result might also demonstrate Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can still hold onto their edge in the suburbs</a>. Even though “yes” on recall performed better than Trump, this contest marked yet another election where the Republican candidate or the Republican-backed ballot position still lost the huge suburban county — a sign that it probably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/us/california-recall-orange-county.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t return solidly to the GOP fold</a> anytime soon. Conversely, although the recall vote failed by 26 points in <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/imperialcountycalifornia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily Hispanic</a> Imperial County, which is located along the U.S.-Mexico border, such a result still suggests Republicans might be able to hold onto <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the improvements they made among Hispanic voters in 2020</a>. That’s because that result, while positive for Newsom, is similar to Biden’s 24-point edge in 2020, which is a far cry from Hillary Clinton’s nearly 42-point lead there in 2016. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using California’s recall as a dead-certain indicator of the future electoral environment is a dicey proposition. Instead, keep an eye on the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic-ballot polling average</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval rating</a>, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can serve as broader signals</a> of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where things stand</a> as we move forward.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): With Congress fully back in session, Democrats are once again in the business of legislating. This fall, they’re trying to push through a number of ambitious policies, including both the bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill and their ambitious $3.5 trillion (for now) spending plan, which they’ll most likely pass via budget reconciliation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s not all. Democrats have also said they’ll try to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-democrats-move-forward-a-voting-rights-bill-by-making-a-moral-case-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass a bill on voting rights</a> and, in light of the Senate parliamentarian’s decision to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/senate-parliamentarian-sets-back-dems-immigration-push-80117636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclude a pathway for citizenship for immigrants from the upcoming reconciliation bill</a>,  will continue to push on this front, too. And, of course, looming over all this is the possibility of a government shutdown — there are just eight days before the government potentially runs out of money — as well as an impending fight around raising the nation’s debt limit (Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he and Senate Republicans will <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/20/congressional-clash-increasing-debt-limit/5789047001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refuse to raise it</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So we’re taking a step back today to assess just how likely each of these proposals are to pass Congress, what we think might end up in them if they pass and how Americans feel about them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. What do we make of its chances of passing?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/spot-gerrymandering-state-fivethirtyeight-80189920</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/lee-drutman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee Drutman</a>, senior fellow at New America and FiveThirtyEight contributor):<strong> </strong>A $3.5 trillion bill probably has 0 percent chance of passing. A $2.5 trillion bill, on the other hand, has a much better chance of passing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is all part of a negotiation process, some of which is taking place in public, but most of which is taking place in private. Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have said <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/23/sinema-35t-spending-bill-506583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they can’t vote</a> for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/joe-manchin-democratic-bill-3-trillion-climate-provisions/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bill this big</a>. But there’s still plenty of room to trim, and Manchin and Sinema and other moderates can say they got a victory if they reduce it. The fact is $3.5 trillion has an anchoring effect that makes $2.5 or $2 trillion seem reasonable. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a classic bargaining strategy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter):<strong> </strong>I agree with Lee. I feel like it will pass, but I’m <em>almost certain</em> it won’t cost $3.5 trillion. I say that because, once again, it seems like progressive and moderate Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/progressives-democrats-budget.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are at an impasse</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/manchin-i-could-not-support-3-5-trillion-in-spending-120688197914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about the price tag associated with the bill</a> and members are essentially talking past each other. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reason why I think it still passes, though, is because it’d be a pretty humiliating defeat for President Biden if it didn’t. I know there are a lot of threats being thrown around from both progressive and moderate Democrats, but I want to think that the glue holding everyone together is that no one wants to harbor blame for tanking Biden’s agenda — and there’s a lot on the line here. So it’s likely not everyone is going to be happy, but maybe out of a shared sense of not wanting everything to fail, Democrats will find a way to figure this out?</p>

				What California’s Recall Election Can — And Can’t — Tell Us About The 2022 Midterms <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/?cid=_inlinerelated">Read more. »</a>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): Agreed. Manchin — who, of course, is one of the crucial moderate swing votes that Democrats need to convince in order to pass their agenda — has said that $3.5 trillion is too much and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/manchin-pelosi-biden-3-5-trillion-reconciliation-government-spending-debt-deficit-inflation-11630605657" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has called for a “pause” on the legislation</a> (presumably so it can be pared down to a number he feels better about). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The flip side of this, though, is that some progressives — such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal — have said <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewSolender/status/1440092700804530178?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they won’t vote for anything smaller than $3.5 trillion</a>. Their preference is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-democrats-3-5-trillion-reconciliation-bill-face-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closer to $6 trillion</a>, so they already see the $3.5 trillion number as a compromise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So the question is, who blinks first? And if no one blinks, there goes Biden’s signature domestic legislation. For that reason, I agree with Alex<strong> </strong>that the Democrats will figure out a way to make it work.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Yeah, considering <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how underwater Biden’s approval rating is now</a>, I think there’s a need for the Democrats to succeed in passing this, showing they can be effective leaders. </p>



<figure><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-1.png"></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Right, because to Alex’s original point — no Democrat wants to be responsible for sinking this, moderate or progressive. So it seems as if we have consensus here — you all think some version of this bill will pass eventually, just not necessarily at its current price tag.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Do we have a sense yet for what will actually make it into this bill? And whether some proposals are more popular than others?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I think the things that get cut are the things that the moderates will want to fight for. For instance, if Sinema <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/19/kyrsten-sinema-biden-drug-pricing-prescription-plan-512907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposes pricing reforms to prescription drugs</a> and wants to make that a key issue, it’s likely that it will be struck from the reconciliation bill.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m using <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/views-on-the-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July AP-NORC survey</a> to answer to your second question, Sarah, but it seems like while things like funding for roads, bridges and ports are pretty popular, some additional things that might be tackled in Democrats’ solo bill weren’t quite as popular — especially among Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While about two-thirds of Americans surveyed (67 percent) said they support funding for affordable housing, just 41 percent of Republicans do, compared to 85 percent of Democrats. There is also a pretty large gap in support for free community college tuition, with 27 percent of Republicans in favor versus 76 percent of Democrats. And of the 12 topics AP-NORC asked about, both Republicans and Democrats were least in favor of things like funding for electric vehicle charging stations (23 percent and 64 percent, respectively) and funding for passenger and freight rail services (37 percent and 68 percent). </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I’m not sure that what is popular with the public is going to determine what stays and what goes, though. To Lee’s point, it’s all about what’s palatable to these moderate senators. And sometimes, they are reluctant to pass things — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-some-senate-democrats-voted-against-raising-the-minimum-wage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like a higher minimum wage</a> — that are nevertheless broadly popular with the public. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s interesting to think about why that is: Are they misreading the electorate? Are they trying to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/09/pharmaceutical-industry-backs-democratic-holdouts-on-drug-pricing-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">satisfy their donors</a>? Do they just genuinely oppose liberal fiscal policy?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> But as Democrats jockey back and forth on this party-line reconciliation bill, does that put their bipartisan infrastructure bill in jeopardy at all? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Asking because the bipartisan bill actually passed the Senate in August, but Democrats in the House won’t vote on it until this other bill is ready, although as we saw with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderates in the House</a>, appetite for this strategy might be waning among some Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes, that bill is in danger too — and we’ll have an answer pretty soon. House Democratic leaders have said they will put the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2021/09/21/sinema-house-mods-get-their-way-494417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a vote on Sept. 27</a> — contrary to the wishes of progressives who didn’t want to vote on it until after the $3.5 trillion bill was resolved. The question now is whether progressives follow through with <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1440027969154478087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their threats to vote against the infrastructure bill</a> if they don’t get their way. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I agree that the infrastructure bill is probably in danger now, too, because as Nathaniel said earlier, a lot of this comes down to who blinks first. And it seems like the biggest bargaining chip progressive Democrats have right now is threatening to tank the infrastructure bill.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> If you look at <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how often House Democrats have voted in line with Biden’s position</a> so far this year, all but one Democrat has done so at least 89 percent of the time. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="714" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.16.22-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.16.22-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.16.22-PM.png?w=590 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.16.22-PM.png?w=1180 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That’s why I think if push comes to shove, even progressive Democrats will hold their nose and vote for the infrastructure bill. House leadership probably wouldn’t be holding this vote next week if they didn’t believe it would pass.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maybe a few progressives will vote against it out of protest, but I bet it will be just few enough that the bill still passes (perhaps with the support of a few moderate Republicans too?).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I agree with Nathaniel. Progressives have actually moved the needle quite a bit, and my guess is they understand that. A lot of this is about positioning for the future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Progressives will vote against it only if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn’t need their votes. It’s also possible multiple votes fail before a deal is reached.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> It’s also possible the government runs out of money … throwing any talk of passing either this infrastructure bill or the other one on the backburner, no?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As I said at the outset, there are just eight days before the government potentially runs out of money — and Republicans don’t seem likely to pass <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-dare-gop-vote-government-funding-bill/story?id=80146918" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ short-term government funding bill</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What are the risks Democrats face with the possibility of the government running out of money and Republicans also refusing to raise the nation’s debt limit? Does this potentially undermine Democrats’ larger legislative goals?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/gop-critics-trumps-big-lie-struggling-win-reelection-80138507</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I think a government shutdown is quite likely. I would guess both sides see it in their interest because it sharpens the differences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Really, Lee? That’s interesting. I feel like a government shutdown with Democrats in full control of the federal government would be quite embarrassing for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yeah … it certainly didn’t go well for former President Donald Trump and Republicans in 2019 when <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/government-shutdown-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they played the government shutdown game</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Exactly, Sarah. And during that shutdown — and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/heres-happened-time-government-shut/story?id=26997023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the one in 2013</a> — Democrats presented themselves as the responsible, anti-shutdown party. It would be quite the 180 for them to now allow one. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>But there’s the short-term and the long-term aspect. The 2022 midterms are still a ways off, and the Republican strategy is to obstruct, obstruct, obstruct, and make Biden seem like a failure, while the Democratic leadership’s strategy is to get the moderates to see that Republicans are unwilling to compromise — maybe even convincing moderates to agree to get rid of the filibuster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I think McConnell is trying to triangulate here — that is, show just enough willingness to compromise so as not to provoke Manchin and Sinema into abolishing the filibuster — but not so much as to actually help Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Wow. That seems like a very high-risk, high-reward strategy. Do you think the demise of the filibuster is really that important to institutionalist Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Pelosi? And for that matter, what about Biden, who still (publicly, at least) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/07/21/us/politics-biden-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposes ending the filibuster</a>? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m super, super skeptical, since there’s never been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/filibuster-vote-count/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread support among Democratic lawmakers</a>, let alone <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_042921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the public, to end the filibuster</a>. Late last month, we found that public attitudes on filibuster reform <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-democrats-move-forward-a-voting-rights-bill-by-making-a-moral-case-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely budged</a> even when voting rights were on the line, so I’m not super confident there’s an appetite for reforming it for any of Democrats’ other priorities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>It’s all part of the long game, though. If Biden is going to abolish the filibuster — or at least reform it — it has to be at the end of a process where he can say he’s changed his mind because of Republican obstructionism. Same for Manchin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The one thing I find interesting around the impending fight over government funding is that this crisis over the government spending too much money isn’t new. In fact, Republicans racked up a significant amount of spending debt under the Trump administration — America’s debt rose by almost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/14/trump-legacy-national-debt-increasee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$7.8 trillion during Trump’s presidency</a>. But as FiveThirtyEight contributor Dan Cox wrote earlier this year, it’s possible voters won’t factor that into the current fight over the debt ceiling and will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-push-for-big-government-solutions-is-popular-now-but-it-could-backfire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instead blame Biden/Democrats for big spending proposals</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why it seems as if the fight over the debt limit comes at an especially difficult time for Democrats. Do we know how Americans feel about government spending now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Americans are happy to spend lots of money on things they want. Quinnipiac found that <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">62 percent of Americans</a> favored the $3.5 trillion spending bill on social programs such as child care, education and Medicare expansion. That poll notably mentioned the price tag, which not every poll asking about the budget bill does. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>And it doesn’t seem like the price tag of the bill is turning off voters the same way it is for moderate Democrats. An August HuffPost/Data for Progress survey, which tested three hypothetical spending amounts, found that <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/8/dfp-reconciliation-bill-size.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support — regardless of the price tag — was almost the same</a>. Over 60 percent of respondents in each group said they supported the proposal by about a 2-to-1 margin regardless of whether pollsters said the bill would cost $1.5 trillion, $2.5 trillion or $3.5 trillion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>For Democrats, I think the far more consequential bill for the midterms and for the 2024 presidential election is their latest attempt to pass sweeping voting rights legislation, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/14/1036812609/senate-democrats-offer-a-new-voting-bill-but-a-gop-filibuster-likely-blocks-the-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Freedom to Vote Act</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’m just not convinced government spending is going to move many voters in the midterms. Republicans are going to accuse Democrats of spending too much money no matter what.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’re at a very strange point in our politics in which the connection between policy and election outcomes is very tiny. The fundamentals have always been more important than policy, but now <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-dont-fear-an-electoral-backlash-for-opposing-really-popular-parts-of-bidens-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s true more than ever before</a>, given just how few voters are changing their minds. For instance, despite all that happened between 2016 and 2020, the 2020 presidential election saw the <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/how-donald-trump-turned-off-swing-voters-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smallest share of voters who changed which major party they voted for</a>, going back to at least the 1948 and 1952 presidential elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Lee brought up one of Democrats’ other big priorities this fall: passing a voting rights bill. Alex, Nathaniel, you’ve both <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered this issue</a> a lot <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-states-where-efforts-to-restrict-voting-are-escalating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for FiveThirtyEight</a> — what do you think the odds are that Democrats are going to be able to get something through Congress?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I don’t think a voting-rights bill will pass. Even the Freedom to Vote Act — which is essentially a compromise version of H.R. 1, the For the People Act, with controversial provisions like public financing for campaigns removed or reduced — was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/revised-democratic-voting-bill-drops-controversial-provisions-tweaks-others-as-pressure-for-action-mounts/2021/09/14/6c59def8-150a-11ec-9589-31ac3173c2e5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met with a cool reception from Senate Republicans</a>. Even moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins still felt like the bill was too much of a federal takeover of state election administration. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So to me, it just keeps coming back to the question of ending or circumventing the filibuster. While it’s not impossible that Democrats could, say, create a voting-rights exemption from the filibuster in order to pass this bill, I don’t think it’s likely. Manchin and Sinema’s opposition <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/manchin-filibuster-biden/2021/04/07/03635ab2-97fd-11eb-b28d-bfa7bb5cb2a5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seems firm</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Slim to none, if I’m being honest … The Guardian <a href="https://twitter.com/hugolowell/status/1440062265495986176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported earlier this week</a> that the Freedom to Vote Act likely won’t move this week as Manchin is looking to shore up Republican support. But getting Republicans on board with any voting rights legislation is highly unlikely, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-democrats-move-forward-a-voting-rights-bill-by-making-a-moral-case-for-it/">as we’ve said before</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I’m more bullish on the Freedom to Vote Act — I give it a 50-50 shot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Why, Lee?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>Democrats see this as a priority. Although, of course, part of this is a performance again. That is, Manchin has to make a very public showing of trying to get Republicans on board and he has to fail.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the dangers of a contested 2024 election are becoming more real to Democrats as Republicans continue to push <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baseless claims of election fraud</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass restrictive voting laws in the process</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bottom line is Biden is going to come under tremendous pressure to intervene. Democratic activists are just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/biden-voting-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely fired up about passing a voting rights bill</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’ll admit that at one point I thought Manchin would support ending the filibuster to pass a voting bill, but now I feel less confident about that, namely because he said in April that he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joe-manchin-filibuster-vote/2021/04/07/cdbd53c6-97da-11eb-a6d0-13d207aadb78_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I can’t tell which is more plausible: Democrats ending the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation or 10 Republican senators signing onto the newest bill.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Ooh, good question, Alex.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>Alex<strong> </strong>— I would say the first. The second has a 0 percent chance of happening.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I would say neither. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="😭"> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I agree with Lee that this particular bill definitely won’t get 10 Republican votes. But I’d be curious what would happen if Democrats tried to pass, say, a stand-alone gerrymandering ban.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Plus, Republicans and Democrats have different approaches to voting rights legislation, and polls do a fairly good job of capturing that. According to <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/06/09050746/210636_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Morning Consult/Politico survey</a> from June, Democrats (70 percent) are way more likely than Republicans (32 percent) to think restricting voting access is a major threat to American democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Right, Alex — Republicans just fundamentally see voting differently from how Democrats see it. According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/22/wide-partisan-divide-on-whether-voting-is-a-fundamental-right-or-a-privilege-with-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center poll</a> from July, 78 percent of Democrats feel that voting is a “fundamental right for every U.S. citizen and should not be restricted.” But 67 percent of Republicans believe that voting is a “privilege that comes with responsibilities and can be limited.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, so it doesn’t seem as if there is consensus among you all on whether Democrats will be able to get a voting rights bill through Congress. What about immigration reform and passing a pathway to citizenship, now that the Senate budget parliamentarian has said that can’t be included in the upcoming reconciliation bill? Is that even less likely to pass Congress than the voting rights bill?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I would say immigration reform is dead for now. It’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-became-stuck-on-immigration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a great issue for Democrats</a>, especially going into the midterms, and it’s certainly not the issue that 50 Democrats are going to abolish the filibuster for.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I think it’ll happen eventually, Sarah, but I’m also not sure anything will happen imminently here either because it doesn’t seem like Democrats had a concrete Plan B after the Senate parliamentarian ruled against their efforts to include immigration reform in the spending bill?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ve read reports that Schumer and other Democrats want to <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/senate-parliamentarian-sets-back-dems-001909237.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold additional meetings with the parliamentarian</a> to find alternative ways to include citizenship opportunities. But since there’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/20/senate-parliamentarian-rules-on-immigration-in-democratic-budget-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably not enough Republican support</a> to pass an immigration bill without using the reconciliation process, I think the odds are stacked against Democrats on this one, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I think it has a better chance than voting rights legislation, though, if only because there’s still a <em>chance</em> it could pass via reconciliation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also worth noting that creating a path to citizenship for many immigrants is quite popular with the public. In an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/20/998248764/despite-concerns-about-border-poll-finds-support-for-more-pathways-to-citizenshi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR/Ipsos poll</a> from May, 66 percent said they supported it for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, and 70 percent supported it for immigrants with temporary protected status.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, we’ve covered a lot of ground regarding what’s at stake this fall. What are you going to be paying special attention to moving forward as Democrats try to pass big parts of their agenda?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’ll be keeping a close eye on whether there’s any movement on axing the filibuster, though I’m <em>highly</em> skeptical this will happen. And I’m curious to examine the bubbling tensions between progressive and moderate Democrats more. I know that’s not a specific *policy thing* to watch, but it’s still fascinating, considering a lot of media attention has been on fissures within the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I’ll be watching the infrastructure vote in the House on Sept. 27. How many progressives will vote for it? And if most of them do, does that undercut their current claims that they won’t accept a number lower than $3.5 trillion for the reconciliation bill?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lee.drutman: </strong>I suspect we’re going to see a lot of failed votes for Democrats over the next several weeks and a lot of public bargaining and a lot of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/21/democrats-biden-domestic-agenda-implode-513218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Democrats in disarray” stories</a>. But I’ll be watching to see what compromises senators are spelling out between the lines, and what they are not taking off the table.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I never ever bet against Nancy Pelosi.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In Christian art, saints often hold an object associated with their martyrdom. Saint Stephen, stoned to death, <a href="https://ssjd.ca/2020/08/19/on-the-feast-of-st-stephen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holds a pile of rocks</a>. Saint Lawrence, burned over an iron grill, <a href="https://saintlawrencemartyr.org/our-patron-saint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stands with a gridiron</a>. Saint Lucy <a href="https://www.catholicherald.com/news/catholic_living/religious_vocations/st__lucy_points_the_way_to_christ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offers a small dish</a> with two eyeballs, a reference to her own eyes having been gouged out with a fork.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the same principles applied to right-wing martyrs these days, plenty would be holding just a lawsuit with their name as the defendant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of Americans</a> who have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol have been lionized as freedom fighters by some on the right, including <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/07/29/gaetz-mtg-turned-away-from-jail-during-visit-to-jan-6-political-prisoners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members of Congress</a>. It’s what inspired the “Justice for J6” rally — the muted <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/18/1038551992/us-capitol-january-6-j6-rally-washington" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political demonstration</a> that took place this past weekend in D.C. — and it’s the culmination of years of rhetoric on the far-right that has celebrated violent, extremist figures. This tendency to beatify certain figures is something mainstream conservatives now share with extremist ideologies elsewhere. The martyrs create a sense of community and underscore an essential narrative: that you can be punished simply because of what you believe, and that the willingness to receive that punishment is worthy of reverence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lifting certain figures to a quasi-sainthood has a long history on the extreme right, dating back to the post-WWI era, according to Daniel Koehler, the director of the German Institute on Radicalization and De-Radicalization Studies. Koehler laid out this history in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19434472.2020.1822426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a paper published last year</a>, citing an example of a group of 16 Nazis killed by police during a failed coup d’état in 1923. Those Nazis became known as the “Blutzeugen” (blood witnesses), which other Nazis honored with specific flags, medals and even two “temples.” But the narrative around these and other Nazi martyrs, Koehler wrote in the paper, “explicitly used the fact (or claim) that they were always killed by the movement’s enemies.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Importantly, though, suicidal demonstrations of ideology were not part of the deal. Unlike jihadist extremists, who have cultural and religious motivations for celebrating those who die in suicide bombings, the far-right tended to elevate individuals who survived or were killed in battle, rather than those who died on a suicide mission. “What their narrative usually tells their followers is you have to stand and fight to the very end,” Koehler said in an interview.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More recently, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/7/18215634/dylann-roof-charleston-church-shooter-bowl-gang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this has manifested through the idolization</a> of mass shooters who were apprehended, such as Dylann Roof, the white supremacist terrorist who killed nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Neo-nazis and white supremacists <a href="https://www.adl.org/blog/hardcore-white-supremacists-elevate-dylann-roof-to-cult-hero-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned such terrorists into memes and icons</a>, often depicting individuals like Roof as a saint (though sometimes with tongue in cheek). The terrorists have even inspired the formation of groups like the “Bowl Gang,” named for Roof’s bowl cut hairstyle. These shooters’ manifestos and journals are routinely passed around among far-right extremist groups online, almost like sacred texts. Koehler said the celebration is because the terrorists are seen as continuing the fight and as willing to suffer personally for the cause.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This trend largely remained relegated to the extreme right until last summer, when 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed two people during protests against police shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Suddenly, those in the mainstream right had a figure to rally behind, since his actions could be explained away as self-defense, said Ari Ben-Am, an extremism researcher and information operations analyst for ActiveFence, an online security firm that detects hate speech, terrorism and disinformation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican politicians openly praised Rittenhouse, with <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/04/kyle-rittenhouse-showed-incredible-restraint-gop-rep-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky saying</a> he “exhibited incredible restraint and presence and situational awareness,” and <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonysabatini/status/1330150935771967489?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state Rep. Anthony Sabatini of Florida tweeting</a>, inexplicably, “Kyle Rittenhouse for Congress.” Far-right groups like the Proud Boys (<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-proclaimed</a> “Western chauvinists”) <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dpk4d/kyle-rittenhouse-got-a-proud-boys-serenade-at-a-bar-while-out-on-bail-prosecutors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have stated</a> they support Rittenhouse’s case and “are rooting for him. He has become an American hero and we look forward to celebrating his exoneration with a beer.” Among the more mainstream right online, such as the pro-Trump message board patriots.win, posters have been carefully following Rittenhouse’s trial and celebrating his actions, calling him “Saint Kyle”<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the saint imagery around Roof, this is sometimes done tongue-in-cheek, and other times earnestly, depending on the group and the poster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>32</sup></a> and a “hero,” and making comments such as “Every freedom loving American should be thrilled that this young man was able to defend himself and not become a victim to the mob.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Rittenhouse was the first one to break the barrier of mainstream popularity and support,” Ben-Am said. “He was viewed by both the far-right and the mainstream right as a martyr for the cause, though the mainstream right didn’t really know how to articulate that.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The right’s response to the Jan. 6 attack was mixed. Many Republican politicians condemned the event, and alt-right conspiracy theorists floated the idea that the whole event was a false flag. This theory proposed that the rioters were actually anti-fascists, not Trump supporters. Soon, though, many rallied around those who were arrested or killed, as in the case of Ashli Babbitt, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/01/08/ashli-babbitt-shooting-video-capitol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who was shot and killed</a> by Capitol police during the attack. Those on the right have cast these individuals as martyrs in the fight against what they believe was a fraudulent election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This rallying included the Proud Boys, who have been sharing fundraisers on Telegram for the legal funds of individuals charged for allegedly participating in the attack on the Capitol. They’ve even set up a separate Telegram for promoting these fundraisers called “Free the Boys.” L. Lin Wood, the pro-Trump lawyer who filed a number of lawsuits challenging the 2020 election results and has become a celebrity of the alt-right, has also rallied around Jan. 6 arrestees, calling them “political prisoners.” And mainstream Republicans, <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/572632-trump-offers-sympathy-for-those-charged-with-jan-6-offenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including former President Trump</a> and members of Congress like <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-trump-supporters-who-breached-capitol-being-abused-fed-custody-1592629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> and <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/05/12/rep-paul-gosar-calls-jan-6-us-capitol-attackers-peaceful-patriots/5063404001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Gosar</a>, have advocated for arrestees, whom they claim are being unfairly treated. Ben-Am said this evokes the kind of lionization of terrorists on the extreme right, but with individuals who are much more palatable to the mainstream right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We started off with really extreme, decentralized individuals loving people who go kill for their ideology,” Ben-Am said. “The more mainstream it gets, the less violent and extremist the [martyrs] are.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Treating these individuals as ideological martyrs serves a number of functions within these groups, according to Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University, who studies online extremism. Having figures to rally around deepens a sense of community among people who are often largely connected only online, Squire said, while legal fundraisers provide an opportunity to signal in-group values. It also fosters a narrative of persecution that is fundamental to many of these groups since they feel they’re fighting an unjust battle against groups wishing to destroy the American way of life. Depending on which apportionment of the right-wing landscape you’re talking about, those enemies could be the Democrats, the deep state, immigrants or Satan-worshipping pedophiles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It makes what they’re fighting for [feel] on par with other serious political movements and things that have happened in history,” Squire said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the attendance at the Justice for J6 rally was modest, its messaging is evident in many places across the right, tapping into both mainstream and fringe groups. Creating martyrs serves a valuable function in these communities, which can be very energizing if tapped in the right way. And while this particular event failed to do so, the symbol of a martyr is powerful and should not be underestimated.</p>]]></description>

<p>Polls conducted after June 28, 2018, the date this page was published, are listed by the date that FiveThirtyEight collected them; polls conducted before then are listed under the last date that the poll was in the field. Polls from firms that are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/">banned by FiveThirtyEight</a> are not shown. Pollsters that did not release any horse-race polls within three weeks of an election since 1998 do not have a grade and are treated as a C+ by the grade filter.</p>
<p>* Polls marked with an asterisk are <em>partisan</em> polls. Partisanship is determined by who sponsors the poll, rather than who conducts it. Polls are considered partisan if they’re conducted on behalf of a candidate, party, campaign committee, or PAC, super PAC, 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(6) organization that conducts a large majority of its political activity on behalf of one political party.</p>
