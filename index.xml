<p data-paragraph="main">Winning the House of Representatives was supposed to be a gimme for Republicans this year. Democrats’ current majority is just <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight seats</a>. And since the end of World War II, the president’s party has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost 26 House seats</a> in the average midterm election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while Republicans are still favored to flip the chamber, they are no longer the sure bets they once were. That’s because the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national political environment</a> has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved for Democrats</a>, likely partially due to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and end the constitutional right to abortion. According to the Deluxe version of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All numbers in this article are as of Oct. 14 at 10 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> Republicans have a 70-in-100 chance of taking control of the House, and Democrats have a 30-in-100 chance. In other words, Democrats have about the same chance of winning the House as Houston Astros second baseman <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/altuvjo01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">José Altuve</a> has of getting a base hit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At those odds, the chamber is legitimately competitive, which places extra weight on every swing seat. But which seats should we pay attention to? Thankfully, the FiveThirtyEight model can tell us. Along with win probabilities, the model spits out the odds<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find these odds by scrolling to the bottom of the forecast page, downloading the “Model outputs” and opening the file “house_district_toplines_2022.csv” (or, for the Senate, “senate_state_toplines_2022.csv”). The tipping-point probabilities for each seat are listed in the “tipping” column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> that each district will be the “tipping-point seat” in the House, or the seat that clinches a majority for the winning party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the election, imagine that you order all 435 House districts from the biggest Republican victory to the biggest Democratic victory. The 218th seat is the tipping-point seat because it is the House’s median seat by partisanship. Therefore, the party that wins the tipping-point seat, and every seat that is the same color behind it, has won the House. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The FiveThirtyEight model simulates the election 40,000 times. Here are the 10 House seats that were the tipping points most often in those simulations.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Immediately, you can tell why Republicans are favored — but not guaranteed — to retake the House. The GOP is favored in nine of these 10 seats<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including the Arizona 2nd, by a fraction of a percentage point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> — but Republicans’ average chance of victory across these districts is just 60-in-100. Republicans are also helped because the battle for the House takes place on light-red turf. The <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021-22 congressional redistricting process</a> largely preserved a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning status quo</a>. According to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/partisan-lean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan lean metric</a>,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> seven of the 10 most likely tipping-point districts are more Republican-leaning than the nation as a whole. Their average partisan lean is R+2.7.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/oregon-elect-republican-governor-fivethirtyeight-91521213</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">These 10 seats also clearly show that the path to a House majority runs through the suburbs and exurbs. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of population density in these districts, all but the rural Arizona 2nd and urban Michigan 10th are predominantly suburban and/or exurban. The suburbs and exurbs have increasingly become <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where elections are won and lost</a> as the country <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">realigns along urban-rural lines</a> — cities get bluer and the countryside gets redder. And that trend looks like it will continue in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The list reflects how decisive open seats could be in the House too. Around 30 Democrats decided not to run for reelection to the House this year. That’s significantly more than the number of Republicans who retired or ran for another office. Six were also <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X97S6hUby6PPHAMoEwvAxkAUo8EUwLk8xMosx4hVd8c/htmlview?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated in primaries</a>, and two of those (sort of) appear on our list of likely tipping-point seats. In the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/oregon/5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oregon 5th</a>, a progressive Democrat, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, defeated Rep. Kurt Schrader, and Rep. Andy Levin left the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan 10th</a> behind in order to seek reelection in a bluer seat, which he lost in a primary to Rep. Haley Stevens. Two completely new, and therefore incumbent-less, seats were also created by redistricting, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/colorado/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado 8th</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/north-carolina/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina 13th</a>. Finally, one seat on our list is open because of a Republican retirement, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York 22nd</a> (where Rep. John Katko <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/19/new-york-election-katko-00052484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would likely have run</a>). That seat illustrates how Republicans can’t just play offense this cycle — they also have to tend to their own backyard. If Democrats flip enough Republican-held seats, they could keep the House even if they lose a few of their own.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And the other five seats show how crucial incumbents will be to each party’s chances. Four are Democratic incumbents: Rep. Tom Malinowski in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-jersey/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey 7th</a>, Rep. Cindy Axne in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/iowa/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa 3rd</a>, Rep. Tom O’Halleran in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/arizona/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona 2nd</a> and Rep. Susan Wild in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania 7th</a>. But incumbency can also come with baggage. For instance, O’Halleran is a <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/politicalinsider/2014/05/16/independent-candidate-chester-crandell/9150667/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Republican</a> with a <a href="https://voteview.com/person/21739/thomas-c-o-halleran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate voting record</a> in the House. That could be why Democrats still have a chance in Arizona’s 2nd, which became solidly red in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>. But Malinowski has been dogged by an Office of Congressional Ethics finding that he may have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-malinowski-stock-trades-congress-ethics-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violated conflict-of-interest laws</a> by failing to disclose <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-malinowski-stock-trades-congress-transparency-new-jersey-2021-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal stock trades</a>. He’s also facing a strong Republican recruit in the general election, former state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., the son of a former governor. Finally, the last likely tipping-point seat has a Republican incumbent: Rep. Yvette Herrell in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-mexico/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Mexico 2nd</a>. Her presence on the list demonstrates how Republicans are counting on the handful of incumbents they have in Democratic-leaning seats to hold on to make their climb to 218 easier.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is one other thing these 10 districts have in common. It isn’t something that should worry Republicans or Democrats — but rather us election watchers. There hasn’t been much polling in them. We’ve unearthed only 29 polls across the 10 districts, and 19 were partisan polls, leaving us with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a potentially skewed picture of the campaigns</a>. The model accounts for this skew, but we’d rather have independent polls. As a result, our Deluxe forecasts for these 10 districts give more weight to non-polling factors like district partisanship, incumbency and expert ratings. That increases the chances that the election result will surprise us. All the more reason not to take your eyes off the House this midterm cycle.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Our generation grew up watching as the climate crisis got worse and worse and politicians did nothing.” That might sound like a quote from teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, but it’s actually the opening line for <a href="https://www.lcvvictoryfund.org/lcvvf-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new series of political ads</a> appearing in multiple states in the lead-up to the 2022 midterms — ads that the advocacy groups Climate Power Action and the League of Conservation Voters are hoping will tip the scales towards climate-focused Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe loading="lazy" title="Abigail Spanberger: Generation (30s)" width="712" height="401" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPQGMSue4F8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div> 



<p data-paragraph="main">Historically, however, climate change has not been much of a political kingmaker. Even when candidates <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/14/democrats-climate-change-midterms-824745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trusted that their constituents <em>did</em> care deeply about the environment</a>, it hasn’t been something that reliably changed votes. In the 2020 presidential election, for example, two-thirds of voters told exit pollster Edison Research that climate change was a “serious problem” — but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/18/energy-202-so-how-much-did-climate-change-matter-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 percent of that same group voted for then-President Donald Trump</a>, a candidate whose position on climate change was … <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51213003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inconsistent</a> … at best. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So <a href="https://www.lcvvictoryfund.org/news/climate-power-action-lcv-victory-fund-announce-12-million-strategic-paid-media-and-direct-mail-campaign-to-turn-out-two-million-climate-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $12 million ad campaign</a> aimed specifically at promoting Democratic candidates’ climate change bona fides seems, at first glance, like a fool’s errand. But even though the content of these ads makes it clear they’re meant for a narrow audience — young voters, who see themselves as part of a generation bearing the consequences of inaction on climate change — the ads aren’t even for <em>all</em> of them. Instead, the groups funding these ads are trying to reach a specific sliver of a slice of a subset of young voters. And yet there’s reason to think that, on those slender margins, climate change could be becoming an issue that really sways elections. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">One thing definitely working in favor of climate change as a voting issue this year is the existence of actual legislative change on climate, said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Attempts to reach out to voters on climate issues are happening in context with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden’s spending bill that includes a number of tax breaks, new regulations, financing and incentives focused on <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23281757/whats-in-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reducing the country’s carbon emissions</a> over the long term. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/oregon-elect-republican-governor-fivethirtyeight-91521213</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The passage of that bill is genuinely a big deal, Leiserowitz said. Outside of that, “there has been little to no major national action on climate change. And I’ve been doing this for 30 years,” he told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The passage of the IRA is in keeping with what voters say they want. A large majority of Democratic voters think the Biden administration and Congress need to be doing more to deal with climate change — 82 percent according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/07/14/americans-divided-over-direction-of-bidens-climate-change-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center survey from May</a>. And that same report found that 58 percent of all Americans felt that the federal government wasn’t doing enough to combat climate change. Given results like that, it would be easy to assume that the passage of a federal bill finally addressing climate would be something that could really motivate voters — at least the liberal-leaning ones.<br><br>But the relationship between voters and climate policy has long fallen under the label of “it’s complicated.” There is an established gap between what voters say they want — action on climate change — and what they’re willing to do to achieve that. In 2019, for example, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-climatechange/americans-demand-climate-action-reuters-poll-idUSKCN1TR15W" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling by Reuters and Ipsos</a> found that while 69 percent of Americans wanted the government to take “aggressive” action on climate change, only 42 percent were likely to install solar panels on their own home; 38 percent were likely to begin carpooling to reduce emissions; and just 34 percent were likely to pay an extra $100 a year in taxes to support climate policies. And in 13 years of YouGov polls <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/most-important-issues-facing-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracking which issues registered voters see as the most important</a>, climate change has consistently taken a back seat to economic issues like jobs and inflation. As of Oct. 10, 12 percent of voters listed climate change and the environment as their No. 1 concern, while 22 percent cited inflation and high prices. It’s not that emphasizing climate change is a turn-off for voters — President Biden got a solid B+ on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIi4iCw2EuaO0B7X_J-e7cZlAuyzMba2vFUwA1GF6gQ/edit#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenpeace’s 2020 election Climate Scorecard</a>. But neither is climate an issue that seems to attract voters on its own. Having the highest score on the Greenpeace scorecard during his candidacy was not enough to catapult Washington’s Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, to the White House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That history is probably why ads touting climate change policy have been relatively rare this campaign cycle. Of the nearly 350 ad campaigns the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics is tracking in this midterm election, <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-2022-ad-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion and crime have been the primary issues</a> at play, to the point that the center’s most recent analysis doesn’t even mention climate. Even in the month of September, after the passage of the IRA, ads focused on energy and the environment were still playing third fiddle to other issues like crime and inflation, according to <a href="https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/issues-sept22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from the Wesleyan Media Project</a>, which documents details of political advertising. The project found that 15 percent of nationwide political ads in September were focused on energy and environmental issues (which could include climate change), compared to 26 percent of ads focused on public safety and 19 percent on inflation. Even among the ads created by the LCV, some aren’t about climate change or the IRA, specifically — instead talking more broadly about <a href="https://youtu.be/pWCTnI5tQkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how a specific candidate fits with the Democratic platform</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the main goal of the LCV’s ad campaign appears to be persuading people to vote for a candidate <em>because</em> that person has gotten climate policy done — something that’s presented in the ads as a bit of a surprise, a “can you believe they actually did it?” moment. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc4046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Years of research</a> have shown that the persuasion effects created by advertising — whether <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political</a> or <a href="https://www.williamrinehart.com/2019/advertising-uneasy-persuasion-or-means-of-social-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">otherwise</a> — <a href="https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/quickly-forget-duration-persuasion-effects-mass-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not last very long</a>, and <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2020/09/02/political-ads-have-little-persuasive-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they are very small</a>, capable of maybe creating a percentage-point difference in swing, said Lynn Vavreck, a professor of politics and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. “But don’t confuse small in size with not being pivotal,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because while the voting public as a whole has this messy situationship with climate change, there’s a segment of Democratic-leaning voters for whom it is increasingly the real deal. Young and left-leaning voters <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/most-important-issues-facing-the-us?crossBreak=democrat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were most likely to rank climate change</a> as their No. 1 issue in the most recent YouGov poll from Oct. 10. Eighteen percent of voters under 30 and 19 percent of Democrats said it’s the most important issue facing the U.S., compared to 11 percent of voters 65 and older, and just 2 percent of Republicans. And in the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos panel survey</a> conducted between April and September using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, as much as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36 percent of Democrats</a> named climate change as one of the country’s top issues.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents could select up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Young people have the strongest beliefs about the reality of climate change and the need to take action on it, said Charlotte Hill, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. That <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/15/gop-climage-change-generation-gap-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trend is so strong that it even crosses party lines</a>: Forty-seven percent of voting-age Republicans under 30 told Pew in May that the government was doing too little to combat climate change, compared to just 18 percent of Republicans 65 and older. But young (and particularly young, left-leaning) voters are such good targets for these ads because they are also <a href="https://about.bgov.com/brief/election-demographics-and-voter-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the age group least likely to turn out for a midterm election</a>. And “it’s also pretty consistent that <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/why-youth-dont-vote-differences-race-and-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the top reason that young people cite</a> for not voting is not liking the candidates or the issues,” Hill said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Targeting the people who care the most about climate change, and are the least likely to just go out and vote on their own, with ads that tell them politicians are actually acting on their desires can produce the kind of small differences that tip the scales in some elections, Hill and Vavreck said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the LCV campaign took this one step further, by targeting ads at 2 million specific voters who live in the districts where that tiny margin of change will matter the most, including <a href="https://www.lcv.org/article/climate-power-action-lcv-victory-fund-announce-12-million-strategic-paid-media-and-direct-mail-campaign-to-turn-out-two-million-climate-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven states where the statewide Senate race is a tight one</a> — Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The model is based off of similar microtargeting work from the 2020 presidential election, when the goal was to persuade undecided voters who cared a lot about climate issues to cast their ballot in favor of Biden, said Pete Maysmith, senior vice president of campaigns at LCV. Those voters approved of Trump more than Biden, but the targeted ads seem to have convinced at least a portion of them to vote Democrat. Based on post-election surveys and a controlled experiment, LCV believes they increased Biden’s vote margin by 5.6 percentage points, relative to the control population. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nobody knows yet how big a difference the group will be able to make with this latest round of micro-targeted ads. But evidence suggests that small can be big, and that fact changes the stakes on climate change advertising. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">For the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past few weeks</a>, we’ve been trying to figure out to what extent, if any, Republicans have regained ground in the race for control of Congress. And the answer is … probably some, but not necessarily as much as the conventional wisdom holds.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a>,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday at 11 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> the GOP now has a 34 percent chance of recapturing the Senate. That’s up from a low of 29 percent in mid-September.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In betting markets, there’s <a href="https://electionbettingodds.com/Senate2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been a much sharper shift</a>. In fact, the markets have the race at nearly even, with Republicans having a 49 percent chance of Senate control. That’s up from a low of 33 percent in late August. The markets were in pretty good alignment with FiveThirtyEight’s forecast for most of the cycle; now they’re not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How come? Well, as I wrote two weeks ago, I don’t think it’s crazy for the markets to be concerned about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systematic polling bias</a>. It’s also not crazy for markets to have anticipated some fallout for Democrats from Thursday morning’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/13/business/inflation-cpi-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worse-than-expected inflation report</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the gap between the markets and the models is big — and growing. And it’s not just FiveThirtyEight’s model. <a href="https://forecast.decisiondeskhq.com/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://projects.jhkforecasts.com/2022-midterms/senate-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">models</a> are similar or don’t even show a Republican rebound at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I wouldn’t care about this much if there had been a <em>steady</em> gap between the markets and the models. If the markets want to take the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hypothesis of predictable polling bias</a> more seriously than the models do, or to put more weight on the long <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history of the president’s party having a poor midterm</a>, that’s fine by me. Aggregating different hypotheses is a strength of markets generally.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The markets and the models are also telling very different stories about the <em>trajectory</em> of the race, though — and I think this gets at two potential ways in which political betting markets sometimes <em>aren’t</em> that smart.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One weakness of these markets is that they tend to follow the media narrative about the race more so than they do the underlying evidence. The source for this claim: yours truly, because I’ve been doing this for a <em>very</em> long time.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most prominent case was in the 2012 presidential election cycle, when Republican Mitt Romney gained ground on Barack Obama after the first debate but then the polls reverted to showing a fairly clear Obama lead, even as &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/oct-24-in-polls-romneys-momentum-seems-to-have-stopped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;media coverage still claimed that Romney had “momentum.”&lt;/a&gt; The models were &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nate-silver-election-odds-2012-10-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;quicker to figure this out than the markets&lt;/a&gt;, although to be fair, the markets were still quicker than &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/nate-silver-joe-scarborough-wanna-bet/321880/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;morning-television-news hosts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">My impression for the past few weeks is that media coverage has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-still-do-not-show-a-gop-bounce-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaning into the Republican-rebound</a> story. (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">So has ours</a>, to be unhypocritical about this.) And in some ways, this coverage is justified. Republicans have unambiguously gained ground in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a> Senate races — and those are important contests! The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steady improvement in political fortunes</a> that Democrats experienced in the summer is over.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the Republican position hasn’t really improved in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a>’s Senate race, and Herschel Walker has probably lost ground in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a>. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>, momentum is murky, and any poll movement is hard to distinguish from statistical noise. The <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s approval rating</a> have also not shifted very much. The outlook in the House continues to favor Republicans but <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t changed much in either direction</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a messy story. People tend not to click on headlines such as “Republicans Gaining Ground In A Few Key Senate Races, But With A Setback In Georgia; National Trends Unclear, Perhaps Some Hint Of A Republican Rebound, But It Could Just Be Noise ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other weakness in these prediction markets is that the traders don’t have a lot of technical sophistication about <em>election forecasting</em>. That’s not to say they aren’t sophisticated in general. Traders may know a lot about politics, they may have a good sense for market psychology, and they may be smart people who are good <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general-purpose estimators</a>. But there are some questions for which <em>actually going through the process of building a model</em> helps a lot, such as in determining how much an election forecast should shift in response to a modest but noisy shift in the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most of these traders aren’t building election models themselves. I’m confident about that, because I know the sort of people who bet on elections. Poker players, sports bettors, quantitatively minded academics — they all have a lot of overlap with Nate World and I often encounter them in personal and professional settings. They’ll mention that they bet on elections, they’ll mention that they follow FiveThirtyEight and other forecasts, but they <em>usually</em><a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are exceptions, but I imagine they come less from individual traders and more from institutions such as hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> aren’t building election models from scratch.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nor should they be building them, frankly, because doing so wouldn’t be greatly time-consuming. Building a halfway decent election model would take — I’d estimate from my own experience — a couple of months of hard work if you had a lot of help, and more than that if you didn’t. It’s not a great investment when an election is held only once every other year. You’d be better off working on models to do options trading or to bet on football, where there’s more liquidity and more frequent opportunities to make money.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A lot of the value the models provide, as I mentioned, is in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking at <em>all</em> the polls</a> and not just the ones that get highlighted in the media, which are often a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1940161219864295" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly nonrepresentative sample</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The models also understand an important fact about midterms: They tend <em>not </em>to turn on a dime, in the way that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential elections sometimes do</a>. (Although even for presidential elections, most <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/2012-election-game-changers-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“game changers” are false alarms</a>.) If you hear about momentum shifts in midterms, you should generally be wary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why? Well, voters aren’t paying all that much attention. Yes, you’re paying attention because you’re a FiveThirtyEight reader. But the general public pays much less attention to midterms than to presidential elections. Take a look, for example, at <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google searches for the word “polls”</a>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1787" height="916" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-14-at-10.15.53-AM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-14-at-10.15.53-AM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-14-at-10.15.53-AM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-14-at-10.15.53-AM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The spikes for presidential elections are much bigger, about three or four times bigger. People certainly notice big stories such as inflation or Roe v. Wade being overturned, but they aren’t following daily news stories in the way they do in presidential years. What happens on cable news tends to stay on cable news.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why, we’ve found, you should be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-a-new-less-volatile-version-of-our-generic-ballot-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautious in interpreting shifts in the generic ballot</a>; your default should be to assume that the public’s preference for which party controls Congress is fairly steady, even more so than for whom they’d like to see elected president. It takes a lot to move the needle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another dissimilarity between midterms and presidential elections is more obvious but still worth mentioning: There are different candidates on the ballot in every state and district. A scandal involving Biden or former President Donald Trump will spill over into every state; one involving Herschel Walker will probably have an impact only in Georgia. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-new-polling-averages-show-biden-leads-trump-by-9-points-nationally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlike in presidential races</a>, it is very much <em>not</em> safe to make inferences about how one state is moving based on how others are; a change in the polls in Pennsylvania tells you approximately nothing about one in Arizona.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s probably bad for FiveThirtyEight site traffic to say this, but the final few weeks of the midterm campaign may not be all that climactic or action-packed. Certainly, a lot of the individual races are quite fascinating, but “October surprises” that affect one race may not affect others. There may be some changes in the big-picture, topline numbers, but probably not huge ones. And that means we’ll enter Election Day with a lot of uncertainty about which party will emerge with control of Congress.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden’s surprise <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marijuana reform announcement</a> last week has mostly gotten attention for pardoning thousands convicted of simple possession of marijuana, a move that many observers have called <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/10/biden-marijuana-pardon-possession-impact-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a small step</a> towards criminal justice reform. But it’s the mostly overlooked second part of Biden’s announcement — a directive to reevaluate pot’s federal status as a Schedule I drug — that has the potential to change the future of American cannabis policy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Schedule I is the federal government’s most tightly controlled drug classification, reserved for extremely dangerous substances with high potential for abuse and no medical use. That doesn’t describe pot, Biden declared last week, and he is now asking his own administration to start the process of making the drug’s legal classification match its reality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reevaluation is more than just an empty gesture. Experts like John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said there’s a very good chance of Biden’s directive leading to actual reform — not decades from now, but by the end of his current term in office. “This is not just a blue-ribbon commission putting together a report,” Hudak said. “This is a formal legal process that is required in order for the executive branch to consider a change in scheduling.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Biden just triggered a process that could end federal pot prohibition as we know it. </p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marijuana landed in Schedule I in 1970, when Congress first passed the Controlled Substances Act, a law that dictates federal drug policy and created five “schedules” under which substances could be classified. Pot’s placement was meant to be only a temporary designation, while officials waited for scientists to finish research on the plant and its effects. But in 1972, after then-Attorney General John Mitchell <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-behind-the-dea-s-long-war-on-marijuana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overruled</a> the scientific commission’s <a href="https://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/nc/ncrec1_17.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendation to decriminalize</a>, marijuana became a permanent Schedule I drug. The decision would later become infamous when interviews with aides to former President Richard Nixon and recordings from Nixon’s White House tapes showed that the administration was using that classification as a way to criminalize, in <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the words of former Nixon aide John Ehrlichman</a>, the “antiwar left and Black people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the sordid history of pot’s scheduling, cannabis has been paralyzed in Schedule I status for more than 50 years because of a legal dilemma created by the law itself. Before pot can be downgraded to a lower schedule, there needs to be scientific evidence that cannabis can be used safely and has at least some medical uses. But the Schedule I status itself severely limits any research into the drug: Subsequent reviews have inevitably failed to find enough evidence to reschedule the drug.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Pot’s Schedule I status remains the most powerful force in American cannabis policy, even as millions of Americans gain access to medical marijuana through state markets. Schedule I is why federal agents can arrest people for smoking a single joint. It’s why scientists can’t easily study the drug. It’s why most banks won’t lend money to marijuana startups and why pot companies pay some of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/04/30/state-legal-cannabis-companies-pays-insane-tax-rates-thanks-to-a-minnesota-speed-dealer/?sh=7527b2ea1008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest federal tax rates</a> in the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moving a drug to a different schedule is a lengthy bureaucratic process — previous reviews of pot’s CSA classification took between six and 22 years to complete, Hudak said. But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/06/biden-marijuana-decriminalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he and other experts</a> think that this reclassification could happen much faster. That’s because Biden is approaching this declassification in a unique — and powerful — way. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That starts with how the president announced his plans. Biden publicly told his appointees that he wants this done “expeditiously,” pressuring his officials to act before his term ends in 2024. “The president is messaging to those appointees — and the appointees will totally understand it — that this is something he wants done [quickly],” Hudak said. In contrast, former President Barack Obama <a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/30/just-released-cnns-jake-tapper-exclusive-interview-with-president-obama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused</a> to take this administrative action, telling reporters that a schedule change had to come from Congress. Biden not only directed his agencies to conduct this review, but announced it by saying that Schedule I “<a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1578097880744820736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes no sense</a>” for pot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The process will begin with the Food and Drug Administration conducting a scientific evaluation of cannabis. This study will look at eight different aspects of the drug, including the substance’s pharmacological effects, public health risks and potential for abuse. The FDA will send this information to the secretary of Health and Human Services, who will then make a recommendation to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The HHS secretary can recommend that pot remain a Schedule I drug, be moved to a lower, less restrictive schedule or be removed entirely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Attorney General Merrick Garland and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra are already taking up the charge. Becerra <a href="https://twitter.com/SecBecerra/status/1578117950816616458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted hours</a> after Biden’s announcement (at 4:20 p.m., in perhaps a nod to stoner culture) that he was “looking forward” to working with Garland to review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law. And the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-statement-president-s-announcements-regarding-simple-possession-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the same day that it is “expeditiously” reviewing pardons and working with HHS to review pot’s scheduling decision.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This forceful move by Biden has made legal experts like Daniel Shortt, a cannabis attorney based in Seattle, optimistic about the chances marijauna could be removed from Schedule I. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This is the most consequential piece of federal cannabis policy since 1937, when federal pot prohibition began,” Shortt said. “However long this process takes, it’s going to end with a significantly different approach to federal prohibition.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there are many ways Biden’s scheduling directive could fail. Chief among them is the evaluation of marijuana’s medical effectiveness. This isn’t the first time the federal government has reviewed pot’s Schedule I status. The DOJ and HHS have studied the issue <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple times</a> and each review has concluded the same way: with the FDA declaring that pot is dangerous and has no accepted medical use, and the DOJ refusing to remove cannabis from Schedule I.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As recently as 2016, the FDA ruled that marijuana had not demonstrated medical value — but there have been major medical cannabis developments in the last six years. Nearly half of oncologists reported recommending medical cannabis to their cancer patients, according to a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29746226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> conducted in 2016 and 2017. And the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the country’s leading academic body for scientific research, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425767/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concluded</a> in 2017 that there is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even the FDA has updated its opinion on the medical use of cannabinoids. In 2018, the agency <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-drug-comprised-active-ingredient-derived-marijuana-treat-rare-severe-forms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> Epidiolex, a pharmaceutical cannabinoid derived from cannabis plants, to treat rare forms of epilepsy. Epidiolex showed benefits in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, effectively proving through the gold standard of medical research that pot can have medical value. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The approval of Epidiolex could be the most important development in changing the FDA’s opinion about pot by demonstrating that cannabis has “medical value and accepted medical use,” Hudak said. But Matt Zorn, an attorney <a href="https://filtermag.org/dea-cancels-psychedelics-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has handled multiple cases against DEA’s scheduling decisions</a>, said it wasn’t clear if Epidiolex would be a slam dunk for rescheduling cannabis. The agency could decide that a pharmaceutical <em>derived</em> from cannabis is categorically different from cannabis itself.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there is power in the president clearly and decisively asking for change. Politics inevitably creeps into the FDA’s scientific review and scheduling recommendation, Hudak said. And this is the first time the president himself, rather than an outside group, has requested a reevaluation of pot. This will likely push the agencies to make a different decision simply “because their boss told them to,” Shortt said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And not only is the president on record supporting pot — both of Biden’s appointees have a history of defending cannabis. In his 2021 confirmation hearings, Garland, who will eventually make the ultimate scheduling decision as the head of the DOJ, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?508877-1/attorney-general-confirmation-hearing-day-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> enforcing federal marijuana law as an ineffective use of federal resources and racially discriminatory in its effect.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Becerra is an even bigger advocate for cannabis reform. As a member of Congress, Becerra repeatedly voted to <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bidens-health-secretary-pick-could-help-reclassify-marijuana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block the DOJ from interfering</a> with medical marijuana programs and to <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2014418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow cannabis businesses</a> to access banking. As California’s attorney general, Becerra helped <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/MEDICINAL%20CANNABIS%20Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">administer</a> the state’s medical marijuana program and he attacked pot’s Schedule I status, telling the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-ol-patt-morrison-xavier-bacerra-20170208-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles Times</a> in 2017 that “The federal government has to catch up and get into the 21st century.” It’s hard to see how Becerra could possibly recommend that pot remain a Schedule I substance, Hudak said, given everything Becerra has fought for over the last decade. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In theory, a drug’s scheduling should be guided by scientists making decisions based on the best available data. But politics has always affected federal drug policy, whether it’s Nixon outlawing pot in the 1970s or Congress creating the<a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/cracks-system-20-years-unjust-federal-crack-cocaine-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> discriminatory <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/cracks-system-20-years-unjust-federal-crack-cocaine-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disparity between crack and cocaine penalties</a>. But this time, with Biden’s announcement, the politics are in pot’s favor.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, President Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-pardons-thousands-convicted-federal-marijuana-possession/story?id=91122888" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pardoned federal offenses</a> for marijuana possession, part of a promise he had made on the campaign trail to decriminalize weed. The order to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/06/granting-pardon-for-the-offense-of-simple-possession-of-marijuana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacate the sentences</a> of at least 6,500 American citizens and lawful permanent residents <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/10/1127708285/marijuana-pardon-biden-black-people-war-on-drugs-harm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elicited praise</a> from some cannabis advocates, while others have said the move is <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/10/biden-marijuana-pardon-possession-impact-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a first step</a> at best. Some activists, especially those who highlight how enforcement of the current law disproportionately targets Black communities, said the pardon <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/08/politics/biden-marijuana-possession-pardons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t go far enough</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, in general, Americans agree that the country’s legislation on marijuana does need an update. According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/05/most-voters-back-federal-marijuana-legalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling conducted by Morning Consult/Politico</a> just days before the Oct. 6 pardon, 6 in 10 American voters said weed should be legal in the U.S. That number rises to about 7 in 10 among voters under 45 (70 percent), Democrats (71 percent) and Black voters (72 percent). Even among the groups least likely to support legalizing marijuana — Republicans (47 percent) and voters 65 or over (45 percent) — close to half of respondents agreed. There’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-do-gop-lawmakers-still-oppose-legalizing-weed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no real divide</a> across regions, either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Current laws, however, do not reflect this sweeping bipartisan, universal support. The legalization of marijuana puts a spotlight on the divide between Americans and politicians, namely Republican members of Congress. Public opinion has changed drastically on this issue in the past two decades, but getting legislation to catch up with an updated national sentiment has not been easy, especially when the topic carries a century of social baggage. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for relaxed weed laws hasn’t always been so widespread. When <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1657/illegal-drugs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> surveyed Americans on the topic in March 1972, eight months after then-President Richard Nixon declared the nation’s infamous war on drugs, only 15 percent agreed that the use of marijuana should be legal. Meanwhile, in a separate Gallup survey conducted several days prior to that, just 11 percent said that they had tried marijuana. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">By April 1977, support for legalization reached 28 percent but mostly plateaued until 2000. Since then, however, support has risen considerably. As of October 2021, 68 percent of Americans said <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/396893/americans-not-convinced-marijuana-benefits-society.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marijuana use should be legal</a>, and in July, 48 percent of Americans said that they had tried it. In other words, those numbers are the highest they’ve been in five decades.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Biden’s order was popular with a <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/lawmakers-governors-and-advocates-react-to-biden-marijuana-pardon-and-scheduling-review-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide range of politicians</a>, it’s not the sweeping change that some Americans would like to see. For starters, not everyone has been on board, such as a handful of Republicans in Congress who have long pushed a hardline attitude against marijuana. For instance, just two weeks ago, a conservative caucus of House Republicans unveiled its <a href="https://banks.house.gov/uploadedfiles/rsc_family_policy_agenda.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Family Policy Agenda</a>, which suggested some sort of link between THC use and suicide in children and adolescents. And the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance, the highest tier in the agency’s hierarchy, deems it <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling#:~:text=Schedule%20I%20drugs%2C%20substances%2C%20or,Schedule%20II" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unacceptable even for medical use</a> at the federal level, at least for now. Biden also called on the Justice Department and Health and Human Services to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/06/1127302410/biden-pardon-marijuana-possession-convictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin a review</a> of marijuana’s current categorization.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the federal restrictions on marijuana use haven’t exactly held up on a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regional level</a>: Thirty-seven states, as well as Washington, D.C., and three U.S. territories have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes, while 19 states, Washington, D.C., and two territories have also done so for recreational use among adults. In other words, the federal law isn’t just out of touch with most Americans — it’s out of touch with most state legislation, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Biden’s pardon is ahead of the curve, as most states have yet not overturned state-level possession convictions. Following the order, the president called on governors to issue similar pardons, which would be a popular move: <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/10/07/d7bc7/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent polling from YouGov</a> found that 62 percent of Americans would back such a measure in their state. In fact, a majority of every demographic group tracked support it except Republicans (41 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Americans are nonetheless split, nearly down the middle, on whether marijuana use harms society at large. In July, 49 percent told <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/396893/americans-not-convinced-marijuana-benefits-society.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> that the impact was at least somewhat positive, while 50 percent said it was at least somewhat negative. Compared with their views on other controlled substances, though, this actually supports the idea that Americans feel positive about marijuana. For example, a whopping 75 percent of Americans say that alcohol use has at least a somewhat negative impact on society. In other words, it’s clear that sentiments among the American public are heading in a solid direction toward legalization. The question now is how long it will take for nationwide policies to reflect where the people stand.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Roughly half of registered voters (49 percent) said they’re more motivated than usual to cast their midterm ballots next month, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-october-2022/">Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking poll</a> conducted Sept. 15-26. That split ticks up slightly among partisan voters, with 57 percent of Republicans and 52 percent of Democrats in agreement. When KFF asked voters what issue they’d most like to hear candidates discuss, a plurality brought up economic concerns (35 percent), followed by abortion or reproductive rights (15 percent) and immigration (9 percent). </li></ul><ul><li>Despite all the buzz about critical race theory, a recent <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/poll-half-of-americans-know-little-about-crt-whats-actually-taught-in-schools/">survey from USC Dornsife</a> found that a slight majority have either never heard of CRT (36 percent) or have heard of it but don’t know what it means (15 percent). And just 4 percent said they knew enough about CRT to explain it to others. On the whole, nearly all Americans agree that certain topics should be covered in high school — like slavery (95 percent), contributions of women and people of color (94 percent) and racial inequality (86 percent). However, the consensus is less sweeping on trans rights (59 percent) and gender identity (59 percent). </li></ul><ul><li>An equal and majority share (66 percent) of both Democrats and Republicans think the other party should have more moderate candidates, per a Sept. 27-Oct. 2 <a href="https://www.moreincommon.com/media/i4xpxmbt/final-nbclx-midterm-survey_v1.pdf">poll by YouGov for the nonprofit More in Common</a>. But each side is less likely to agree that their own party needs moderate options: Only 32 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats say so. Meanwhile, white Americans overall (53 percent) were the most likely of any race or ethnic group to voice a need for more moderate Democrats, while Asian Americans overall (54 percent) were the most likely to say the same about the GOP. </li></ul><ul><li>Almost half of Americans view the country’s health care system overall in a negative light, according to recent <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/402191/majorities-rate-cost-equity-healthcare-negatively.aspx">polling from Gallup</a> that asked respondents to rank various attributes by letter grades (A, B, C, D or F). A whopping 75 percent consider the affordability of the system as either a D grade of “poor” (41 percent) or an F grade of “fail” (33 percent), which is a breakdown that doesn’t waver much along socioeconomic lines. Further, Black Americans (66 percent) and Asian Americans (64 percent) were the most likely groups to give a poor rating for getting equitable care, although women (61 percent) weren’t far behind. In fact, 55 percent of women also said that they’re not confident that their families will be able to afford the health care they need as they age, a much higher share than the 45 percent of men who agreed.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">In a dramatic ending on Thursday to the final scheduled public hearing of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, the committee <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-dramatic-details-latest-jan-hearing/story?id=91470367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously voted to subpoena former President Donald Trump</a>. “We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion, and every American is entitled to those answers,” said committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney ahead of the vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The subpoena means that Trump has been ordered by the committee to provide relevant documents and testimony under oath as part of its investigation. Given the former president’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-fires-back-jan-committee-calls-hearings-disgraceful/story?id=85463648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disdain for the committee</a>, it’s unlikely Trump will willingly testify. Still, the decision to subpoena a former president was remarkable and capped off a hearing that resurfaced evidence of Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 attack. And while today’s hearing might not have changed how people plan to vote, it was a reminder of the ugly reality of what could happen after they do. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While past congressional hearings have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-host-a-congressional-hearing-that-actually-like-does-something/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swayed public opinion</a>, that largely hasn’t been the case for the Jan. 6 committee. Polling of Americans before, during and after the hearings this summer showed negligible movement in opinions on the attack and Trump’s role in it. In late June, a few weeks into the public hearings, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_080922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Monmouth University poll found that</a> 65 percent of Americans considered the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol a riot, 50 percent called it an insurrection, and 34 percent said it was a legitimate protest. By the end of July, after the summer hearings had concluded, those numbers were virtually unchanged: 64 percent said Jan. 6 was a riot, 52 percent said it was an insurrection, and 35 percent said it was a legitimate protest. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The share of Americans who believe Trump is “directly responsible” for the attack hasn’t moved much either: Forty-two percent thought so in June, while 38 percent did in September, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_080922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to another set of Monmouth University polls</a>. Given that roughly a third of Americans — including a majority of Republicans — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/poll-61-republicans-still-believe-biden-didnt-win-fair-square-2020-rcna49630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still believe the 2020 election was stolen</a> from Trump despite the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-courts-election/fact-check-courts-have-dismissed-multiple-lawsuits-of-alleged-electoral-fraud-presented-by-trump-campaign-idUSKBN2AF1G1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mountain</a> of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence</a> to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/post-election-audits-are-normal-whats-happening-in-arizona-is-anything-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the contrary</a>, it’s perhaps not shocking that congressional hearings have struggled to move the needle. It’s also true that voters have a lot of other things on their minds right now. Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey</a> has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracking the issues Americans</a> find most important for the country heading into the election, and while Americans consider “political extremism or polarization” one of the top issues,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents could select up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> they have consistently ranked it behind inflation. And the Americans who identified partisan extremism as a top issue facing the country weren’t necessarily <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-in-10-americans-named-political-polarization-as-a-top-issue-facing-the-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thinking about the Jan. 6 attacks</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But even if the hearing itself isn’t top of mind for voters, they will be impacted by the Jan. 6 attack and the events that preceded it. One such way is through the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of changes to state election laws</a>, many of which were passed with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-big-lie-voting-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the stated motivation</a> of securing elections and preventing fraud, inspired by Trump’s illegitimate claims after 2020. This fall, many voters across the country will be encountering new election laws that require them to show a photo I.D. when voting, register earlier than they used to or find a new place to return their ballot because their local drop box has been removed. Whether or not voters care about Jan. 6, it will affect them this November. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But perhaps the most direct influence of Jan. 6 and Trump’s campaign leading up to it are the hundreds of candidates on the ballot this fall who continue to repeat his allegations of a stolen election. As of Oct. 13 at 5 p.m. Eastern, 200 out of 552 Republican nominees for House, Senate, governor, state attorney general and secretary of state seats have fully denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s analysis</a>, and another 62 have raised doubts. The 200 includes individuals who actively supported Trump’s attempts to overturn the election results <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/06/29/updated-trumps-fake-electors-heres-the-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by signing on</a> to be illegitimate “alternate” electors and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/us/politics/jan-6-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attending the rally</a> that preceded the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If these candidates are elected, they’ll be in positions to meaningfully influence elections, whether as a state legislator passing voting laws or as a secretary of state tasked with administering and certifying elections. And if they aren’t elected, they could just take a page from Trump’s book and cry fraud. Many <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-denying-primary-candidates-are-crying-fraud-win-or-lose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election deniers who lost their primaries</a> did exactly that. And even a few who won did so, too. On a widespread scale, claiming fraud over an election loss could lead to more distrust in elections or, at worst, once again stoke violence. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the committee’s decision to subpoena Trump was extraordinary, it’s far from the kind of October surprise that swings elections. But the shockwaves from Jan. 6 — and from Trump’s baseless election fraud claims leading up to it — will continue to reverberate across the country, into November and beyond. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the months since <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/15/pennsylvania-john-fetterman-stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Fetterman had a stroke</a>, the Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate seat has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/politics/fetterman-return-campaign-trail-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to the campaign trail</a> and started doing interviews — while his opponent’s attacks on his health have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/oz-escalates-attacks-fettermans-health-hostile-pennsylvania-senate-rac-rcna46457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown more and more intense</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Mehmet Oz, the Republican nominee, continues to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flounder in polls</a> and <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/oz-fetterman-announce-third-quarter-fundraising-numbers-in-pa-u-s-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising</a>, he’s taunted Fetterman about initially <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/07/fetterman-to-politico-i-will-debate-oz-00055301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declining to debate</a> and questioned whether his rival is using his stroke as an excuse to avoid a public faceoff. Now, Fetterman’s health is in the news again after the candidate — who’s currently serving as the state’s lieutenant governor — used closed-captioning technology during a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/fetterman-says-stroke-recovery-changes-everything-s-fit-serve-senator-rcna51498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent interview with NBC News</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fetterman said that as part of his recovery <a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/fetterman-addresses-criticism-over-need-for-closed-captioning-during-his-stroke-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he needed the technology</a>, which transcribed the reporters’ questions and displayed them on a screen for him to read, because of a temporary difficulty with auditory processing; in the aftermath of the stroke, Fetterman still doesn’t understand everything that’s said to him. With the captioning, however, he was able to respond to the reporter’s questions (<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-fetterman-stumbles-stutters-during-interview-requires-closed-captioning-after-may-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the occasional verbal slip-up</a>). During the interview, Fetterman said that the stroke has changed his life — but that it wouldn’t affect his ability to serve as an elected official. Still, the interview prompted a new spate of questions <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1579926965716410385?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and digs</a> from Republicans about whether his recovery makes him unfit for a seat in Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-suggest-john-fetterman-sick-serve-neurologists-call/story?id=89590532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lines of attack used against Fetterman</a>, many of which are ableist (meaning they convey prejudice, either overt or subtle, against people with disabilities), tap into long-standing stereotypes about people with disabilities and could affect voters’ perceptions of him. That’s because there continues to be stigma against people with disabilities, according to Lisa Schur, a co-director of the Rutgers Program for Disability Research. As a result, she said, political “candidates with disabilities have to work extra hard to ensure voters that, yes, I’m competent and capable of doing the job.” This stigma can be particularly intense for candidates with mental or cognitive disabilities — or even for candidates where questions are raised about their cognitive function. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, we don’t have enough evidence to say for certain whether candidates with disabilities have a lower chance of winning elections. We <em>do </em>know, however, that people with disabilities are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/31/1020746037/disability-access-representation-ada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatically underrepresented in government</a>. That’s especially true at the federal level where just over 6 percent of elected officials reported having a disability compared with 12 percent at the local level, <a href="https://smlr.rutgers.edu/news-events/news/report-1-10-politicians-has-disability-thats-gap-representation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a study</a> from Schur and her co-director Douglas Kruse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite his health challenges over the past few months, Fetterman’s odds against Oz still look good. Fetterman’s lead in the race <em>is</em> narrowing, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fetterman-oz-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to recent polls</a>, but <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a> still gives the Democrat a more than 7-in-10 chance of beating his Republican opponent. And that’s probably why Oz has ramped up attacks on Fetterman’s health, Kruse suggested. “Oz is …  behind right now and wants to bring up this issue of competence,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fetterman still leading in most polls</a>, it only helps Republicans to amplify ableist stereotypes about chronic illness and the use of accessibility aids to argue that Fetterman is unfit for office. The media’s coverage of Fetterman’s condition is arguably bolstering them, too: The NBC interview <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/fetterman-nbc-interview-stroke-pennsylvania-senate-race-20221012.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused mostly on his health</a> and the reporter who conducted the interview made an offhand comment that Fetterman appeared to struggle to understand small talk beforehand, <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/nbc-reporter-s-comment-about-u-s-senate-candidate-draws-criticism-1.6106910" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which drew criticism</a> from other reporters who had spoken with the candidate and said he did not exhibit issues with comprehension. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, it’s been easy to keep people focused on Fetterman’s health: His ability to speak and understand, rather than his policy positions, were the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3683383-fetterman-discusses-effects-of-stroke-on-daily-life-in-new-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject of</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/12/john-fetterman-stroke-interview-oz-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://freebeacon.com/democrats/stroke-victim-john-fetterman-still-needs-closed-captions-to-understand-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stories</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/edokeefe/status/1580002053723938816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and tweets</a> posted in reaction to the interview. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/john-fetterman-viral-senate-campaign-fivethirtyeight-91184407</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">According to Richard Scotch, a professor of sociology and public policy at the University of Texas at Dallas who researches disability rights and social inequality, some of the stigma surrounding <em>physical</em> disabilities has decreased over time. “They’re not viewed as negatively as they were 60 or even 30 years ago,” he said. That, in part, could be one reason why a spate of public officials with physical disabilities across the political spectrum — including Republicans Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas and Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, and Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois — have run successful campaigns. “There aren’t many critics who would say that their disability hampers their ability to hold public office,” Scotch said. Still, he added, the same isn’t true for all disabilities: “Impairments that affect one’s ability to communicate effectively may be more stigmatizing than those that do not.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having a disability like Fetterman’s, which he and his doctors <a href="https://www.fox43.com/article/news/politics/john-fetterman-health-senate-campaign-trail-pennsylvania/521-4001ec81-7a3a-4866-9eff-04d19bf830db" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe will improve over time</a>, could fall into that category. That’s because having an “invisible” disability versus a “visible” one — having trouble understanding speech, as opposed to using a wheelchair — could get linked in voters’ minds to issues like mental capacity or a cognitive decline, “which are scarier for people to digest,” Schur said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fetterman is not the only politician of late who has had to field questions about his mental abilities. While not physically disabled, older politicians like <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/17/poll-biden-mental-fitness-job-approval-522785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden</a> or Sen. <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/dianne-feinstein-senate-17079487.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dianne Feinstein</a> (the oldest sitting U.S. Senator <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/13/1104843151/senator-dianne-feinstein-cognitive-health-continues-to-raise-concerns-traister" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is reportedly</a> experiencing a decline in her cognitive health) have been repeatedly told that they should step down from or not seek additional terms in public office. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But disability discrimination is not always covered equally: <a href="https://www.history.com/news/5-presidents-who-hid-their-health-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several former presidents</a>, for instance, have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/17/ronald-reagan-alzheimers-president-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in apparent cognitive decline</a> while in office without much question. What might make Fetterman’s case different, however, is that he’s both publicly discussing his condition (unlike other politicians who have hid theirs) and is in an ongoing and competitive race. “There’s this image in America, especially, that the goal is to be completely independent and self-sufficient: All those values that supposedly go along with this kind of ‘capability,’” Schur told me. “Whenever you see somebody dependent on technology, or accommodations, I think some people, especially those with more traditional values, might question whether that person is fit for a particular job.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Oz’s attacks have drawn on these stereotypes: Last month, the Republican <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/election-2022/oz-releases-medical-records-as-health-becomes-focus-of-u-s-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released his medical records</a> and has been repeatedly challenging Fetterman to do the same, despite the fact that doing so <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-a-historically-old-presidential-field-candidates-refuse-to-release-health-records/2020/02/23/a39045f8-5407-11ea-9e47-59804be1dcfb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a fading tradition</a> — and typically employed in presidential races, not Senate races. “If John Fetterman had ever eaten a vegetable in his life, then maybe he wouldn’t have had a major stroke and wouldn’t be in the position of having to lie about it constantly,” a senior communications adviser to Oz’s campaign <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oz-on-fetterman-if-hed-eaten-vegetable-wouldnt-have-stroke-2022-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, Fetterman’s health journey could resonate with some people. According to estimates from Kruse and Schur, 69 million people in the 2020 electorate either had a disability themselves or lived with someone with a disability. “So almost one-third of people have very direct experience with disability,” Kruse said. “And when a politician says they have a disability, I think a lot of people with disabilities and those who are close to them will say, you know, that’s me. That’s part of my identity.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In his interview this week, Fetterman said that his experience gave him an even greater ability to understand the challenges that voters face. “In some ways, having an impairment has some positive valence for candidates because recovering from a serious illness demonstrates grit and resilience,” Scotch said.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, we don’t know enough to say for certain whether Fetterman’s interview and the ongoing recovery from his stroke will change the way he’s perceived. It’s very possible that it won’t, Kruse predicted, since the Democrat utilized widely available closed-captioning technology he said most voters could see as “reasonable.” And despite the fact that our metrics show a tightening race in Pennsylvania, that could be due to a number of factors, including both campaigns ratcheting up attack ads on a host of issues as Election Day approaches or Republican voters coalescing behind Oz. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, though, voters still overwhelmingly have a positive view of Fetterman, according to recent polls. A <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-2022-elections-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September Marist Poll</a> of registered voters in Pennsylvania, for instance, found that a plurality of adults in the state (45 percent) said they had a favorable view of Fetterman compared with 39 percent who had an unfavorable view. Oz, meanwhile, was underwater: Just 30 percent of respondents said they had a favorable view of the former TV personality versus 51 percent who viewed him unfavorably. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, we would expect that this issue will come up again — especially as the race could well determine which party controls the Senate. Fetterman and Oz are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/14/fetterman-campaign-agrees-to-debate-oz-00056741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to debate on Oct. 25</a>, so there’s time for Oz’s attacks to sink in — but also time for Fetterman to respond.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats may currently control the Senate, but many within the party believe 52 Democratic senators are necessary for a true governing majority. That’s because moderate Democratic Sens. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Manchin</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kyrsten-sinema-is-confounding-her-own-party-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyrsten Sinema</a> are reluctant to change the Senate rules and abolish or circumvent the filibuster, which requires a 60-vote supermajority to vote on most legislation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, suppose the party wins 52 seats this November and at least 50 senators vote to suspend the filibuster in the following Congress. The Senate could then pass stalled Democratic priorities like <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/11/senate-democrats-codify-roe-v-wade-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codifying abortion rights into federal law</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/voting-rights-brawl-takes-center-stage-us-senate-2022-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding voting rights</a>. As a result, that’s where Democrats are setting the bar this election cycle: Even President Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/09/23/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-democratic-national-committee-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly asked voters</a> to “give me two more Democratic senators.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, while Democrats have a 66-in-100 chance of holding onto control of the Senate (according to the Deluxe version of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>),<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All numbers in this article are as of Wednesday at 3 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> their odds of winning 52 seats are dicier. In the two most likely scenarios, the party would win either 50 or 51 seats (there’s a 32-in-100 chance of that happening).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="916" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS-50or51seats-desktop.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS-50or51seats-desktop.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS-50or51seats-desktop.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS-50or51seats-desktop.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1064" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS-50or51seats-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS-50or51seats-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS-50or51seats-mobile.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS-50or51seats-mobile.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s not out of the question that the Democratic dream scenario will come true. According to our forecast, there’s a 34-in-100 chance that Democrats will win 52 or more Senate seats this November. In other words, it’s roughly equally as likely that Republicans will win the Senate, that Democrats will win the Senate with 50 or 51 seats and that Democrats will win the Senate with at least 52 seats.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="840" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-desktop.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-desktop.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-desktop.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-desktop.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="954" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-mobile.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rakich-soni.52-SENATORS.-52-mobile.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, just electing “two more Democratic senators” wouldn’t be enough to enact the full Democratic agenda. Those two extra senators would have to actually support it. Luckily for the party, that would probably be the case. The most likely candidate to gain a Senate seat for the Democrats looks like Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71-in-100 chance of winning</a>. And he has been outspoken about his desire to eliminate the filibuster so Democrats can “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/10/politics/john-fetterman-filibuster-senate-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get shit done</a>” — such as <a href="https://twitter.com/johnfetterman/status/1480928903762006017?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protecting voting rights</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/johnfetterman/status/1517305371400056832?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passing stricter gun-control measures</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/john-fetterman-viral-senate-campaign-fivethirtyeight-91184407</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Wisconsin, North Carolina and Ohio are the next-likeliest Senate seats to flip from red to blue. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes has a 30-in-100 chance of winning in November. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley has a 29-in-100 chance of winning her race. And in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a>, Rep. Tim Ryan has a 29-in-100 chance of winning the general election. All three have called for eliminating the filibuster. <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/12/09/mandela-barnes-senate-bid-calls-ending-filibuster/6439461001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barnes</a> and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/18/cheri-beasley/beasley-says-shes-been-very-clear-about-filibuster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beasley</a> have explicitly said they wanted to do so to advance voting-rights legislation, while <a href="https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1541168088539971585" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cheribeasleync/status/1561764535488303104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beasley</a> have specifically cited abortion rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But liberal Democrats have one more roadblock. Abolishing the filibuster to pass these bills in the Senate would be pointless if Democrats can’t also get those bills through the House. And that’s their real challenge. They have just a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29-in-100 chance</a> of maintaining control of the lower chamber, a bit lower than their chances of winning at least 52 Senate seats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in our forecast, not every scenario in which Democrats hold the House is one in which they also win 52 or more Senate seats. Our Senate and House forecasts are powered by the same model, which means we can calculate the likelihood of Democrats’ ideal scenarios coming true in both chambers simultaneously. The result: There is a 22-in-100 chance that Democrats will win a majority of House seats <em>and</em> at least 52 Senate seats.</p>

So it’s remarkable that they have a shot at ending 2022 in a <em>better</em> governing position than they are currently in. But it’s still not <em>likely</em> to happen; Republicans would have to underperform expectations significantly. The probability is roughly the same as flipping a coin twice and getting heads both times — it wouldn’t be shocking, but you shouldn’t count on it either.</p>

		</div>





<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a familiar pattern for this year’s midterm elections: One <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/25/abortion-gop-candidates-governors-races-00058713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate for governor</a> is trying to make the other one talk about abortion. But in most states, it’s the Democrat who’s pushing abortion into the conversation. In Kansas, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-abortion-presidential-legislature-cd8d1d6f24da4612b7faeb325a4611bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s the Republican</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just two months after Kansas voters <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/05/1115808472/kansas-abortion-ballot-measure-campaign-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphatically rejected a ballot initiative</a> that would have removed abortion rights from the state constitution, Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, is mostly skirting the issue. At <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/kansas-governor-debate-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent debate</a>, her Republican opponent, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, needled Kelly about her support for abortion rights, saying that Kelly didn’t support <em>any</em> limits on when abortion should be legal. Kelly responded with the equivalent of a shrug. “I really for 18 years have had the same position on this issue,” she said. “So I really don’t have much more to say.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelly’s silence on abortion shows that not all Democrats are convinced the issue can be deployed to their advantage, particularly in red-leaning states like Kansas. Instead, she’s been focusing on <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/05/kansas-governor-election-debate-laura-kelly-derek-schmidt-marijuana-crime/69529714007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy and education</a>, and <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/09/26/kansas-ads-in-governors-race-often-misleading-disparaging-with-a-partisan-dash-of-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tying Schmidt</a> to the unpopular former governor Sam Brownback. None of the <a href="https://www.washburn.edu/reference/cks/politics/ads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads run by Kelly’s campaign</a> have even mentioned the word “abortion.” And so far, it doesn’t look like a bad approach. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a>,<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> Kelly is slightly favored, with a 66-in-100 chance of winning the election in November, even though she’s <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/this-years-most-vulnerable-incumbent-governors-are-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors</a> this cycle. And while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the polls we do have so far</a> show a tight race, <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/kansas-2022-democratic-governor-laura-kelly-in-tight-race-with-a-g-derek-schmidt-in-gubernatorial-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a September poll from Emerson College/The Hill</a> found that 53 percent of likely voters in Kansas have a favorable view of Kelly, while 45 percent view Schmidt favorably.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few reasons why it might be a smart strategy for a Democrat like Kelly to avoid a focus on abortion rights, even after the ballot initiative’s resounding defeat in August. For one thing, while other Democratic governors, like Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/04/politics/gretchen-whitmer-tudor-dixon-abortion-michigan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built a brand</a> around support for abortion rights, Kelly is different. “It’s not an issue she’s ever really focused on,” said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University-Camden and the director of the Center on American Women in Politics. Back in 2018, when Kelly was running against Republican Kris Kobach, she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-kris-kobachs-defeat-in-kansas-a-model-for-how-to-beat-trumpism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homed in on the same “kitchen-table issues”</a> she’s highlighting this time, similarly breaking with a larger national trend by refusing to engage with her opponent’s Trumpian rhetoric on immigration and voter fraud.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the time, that decision to stray from the national trend seemed to be a canny assessment of Kansas’s state politics. In races at the state or local level, voters may be less influenced by national issues and their own partisan identity. This is partially how Kelly was able to defeat Kobach by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/kansas-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a solid 5-percentage-point margin</a> in 2018, even though Trump won the state by double-digit margins in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/kansas-president-clinton-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-kansas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a>. Over the past decade or so, Republican presidential candidates have consistently won Kansas by double digits, but in 2014 and 2018, the gubernatorial margins were narrower.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This year, Kelly appears to be betting once again that what works for Democrats nationally won’t work for her in Kansas. After all, the fact that Kansans voted down an anti-abortion ballot amendment was never going to automatically translate into support for Democratic candidates. According to <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;home_state=Kansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling by Civiqs</a>, Kansans are only slightly more likely to think abortion should be legal in all or most cases (49 percent) than to think it should be illegal in all or most cases (47 percent). And the anti-amendment campaign’s advertising didn’t focus on abortion rights in redder, more rural parts of the state — instead, its ads <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/why-kansas-abortion-amendment-failed-even-in-rural-counties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrayed the amendment</a> as a government intrusion into Kansans’ freedom and bodily autonomy, similar to a mask mandate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because the Kansas amendment was the first opportunity for voters to weigh in on the issue in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning abortion rights, the anti-amendment campaign also benefited from a lot of national attention — and national money. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the course of 2022, the anti-amendment campaign pulled in more than $10.5 million<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total contributions include itemized and unitemized (including those under $50) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> in financial contributions, including some major out-of-state cash. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of campaign-finance filings from the two major groups on either side of the amendment, the vast majority (84 percent) of the anti-amendment donations of $50 or more<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the organization against the amendment, did not itemize donations under $50, which totaled $125,712, so we were unable to analyze where they came from. We calculated percentages based on dollar amounts, not the number of contributors, because contributors could donate more than once. A total of $52,970 came from donors who did not provide their addresses, so this was excluded from the analysis of contributions by state. In-kind contributions were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> came from donors with addresses outside Kansas, including one contribution of nearly $1.3 million from former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and another contribution of nearly $1.5 million from Sixteen Thirty Fund, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/17/dark-money-sixteen-thirty-fund-522781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left-leaning “dark money” group</a>. By contrast, nearly $1.7 million came from donors with addresses inside Kansas.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The pro-amendment campaign, meanwhile, raised less money — nearly $6.7 million<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total contributions include donations under $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> in financial contributions, according to its last report — but almost all of it (99 percent) came from donors with addresses in Kansas.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a direct comparison with donations to Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, we excluded donations to Value Them Both, the main organization supporting the amendment, under $50, which totaled $54,114 plus an additional $120 in unitemized contributions (denoted as “$50 or less”). A total of $17,495 in contributions came from donors who did not provide their addresses, so this was excluded from the analysis of contributions by state. In-kind contributions were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> That included some large donations, too, such as one contribution of nearly $1.3 million from the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archdiocese made multiple contributions of at least $350,000, excluding in-kind contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> and one contribution of $300,000 from the Catholic Diocese of Wichita,<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diocese made multiple contributions ranging from hundreds of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> so it’s hard to say whether one side had more grassroots support in Kansas than the other. What is clear from this data, however, is that the anti-amendment campaign’s large cash advantage was fueled mainly by out-of-state donors, not by a surge in financial support from within Kansas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s other evidence, too, that abortion rights simply aren’t a big priority for Kansas voters in the upcoming midterm elections. According to that Emerson College poll, 48 percent of likely voters say the economy is the most important issue in the election, followed by a much smaller share (16 percent) who say abortion is the most important. The poll also found that only 72 percent of Kansans who voted “no” on the amendment (i.e., those in favor of preserving abortion rights in the state constitution) are planning to vote for Kelly, showing that support for a Democratic governor and opposition to the amendment aren’t linked for some voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it makes some sense for Kelly to break with the nationwide trend and steer clear of the issue of abortion rights. Whether it’s a good idea for Schmidt to bring up the issue, however, is a different question. The Emerson College poll found that Kansas voters are actually more likely to say they align most with Kelly on abortion rights (48 percent) than with Schmidt (44 percent). It’s possible, therefore, that Schmidt might benefit from taking a page out of Kelly’s playbook and focus on matters like the economy instead of attacking her on an issue that isn’t a high priority for voters — <em>and</em> that he doesn’t have the advantage on.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This November, Vermont voters <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look very likely</a> to reelect Republican Gov. Phil Scott <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and to send</a> Democratic Rep. Peter Welch to the U.S. Senate. Considering the candidates, the partisan disconnect between these two major statewide races might not seem shocking. After all, Scott ranks as <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/11/whitmers-approval-ticks-up-in-michigan-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the nation’s most popular governors</a> and Welch has served as Vermont’s lone House member for eight terms, <a href="https://electionarchive.vermont.gov/elections/search/year_from:2006/year_to:2020/office_id:5/stage:General" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easily winning reelection over and over again</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the larger context of the 2022 midterm elections and national political trends, Vermont couldn’t be stranger. That’s because the voting margins in the Senate and governor races of most other states won’t differ that much, thanks to a decreasing tendency for voters to back one party’s candidate in one race and the other party’s candidate in another — an electoral phenomenon known as casting a <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/split-ticket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split-ticket</a> vote. While there will still be at least minor differences in these races, nowadays most voters <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to fall in line</a> behind either the Democratic or Republican candidates, making it more likely that a state’s election results for Senate and governor will look pretty similar.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This November, 26 states have both a Senate and a governor’s race, and using the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight midterm forecast’s</a> average margin from each contest, we can project just how close the races in 24 of those states will run together.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of a special election, Oklahoma has two Senate races with its single gubernatorial election, so we actually have 25 cases as we compare Oklahoma’s governor’s race to each Senate contest. We excluded Oregon and Alaska from this analysis because Oregon independent Betsy Johnson &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;looks likely to win&lt;/a&gt; more than 10 percent of the vote in the state’s &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;governor’s race&lt;/a&gt;, which complicates comparing the forecast margin to Oregon’s &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Senate contest&lt;/a&gt;; and because multiple candidates from the same party are running in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alaska’s Senate race&lt;/a&gt; and a high-profile independent, former Gov. Bill Walker, is also running in the state’s gubernatorial contest. Projected margins are from our Deluxe forecast as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern on Oct. 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>23</sup></a> In Vermont, we estimate Welch should win by roughly 23 percentage points over his Republican opponent, while we expect Scott to defeat his Democratic opponent by about 24 points, putting those races a whopping 47 points apart. But Vermont is tracking to be an outlier: Our forecast’s median difference between the margins in a state’s Senate and governor races is only a bit more than 6 points (Pennsylvania), as the table below shows.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the median rather than the average across these states and races because we don’t have a large sample size, which makes outlier results like Vermont’s more likely to skew an average and potentially understate the amount of straight-ticket voting going on these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> That median difference would be the lowest in a midterm election in over three decades, indicative of how split-ticket voting has declined as a result of the increased polarization and nationalization of American politics.</p>

 <p>“Open” indicates that the incumbent senator or governor is not running for reelection. Some numbers may not add up due to rounding. The forecast margin is based on FiveThirtyEight’s “Deluxe” model as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on Oct. 11.</p>
 <p>Includes only races where both a Democrat and Republican are running, and excludes races with a major independent candidate projected to win at least 10 percent. Because of a special election, Oklahoma has two Senate elections, so we compared each to the state’s single governor’s race.</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Now, Vermonters wouldn’t be completely alone in sizably splitting votes in their Senate and governor races. Next door, New Hampshire looks <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very likely to reelect</a> Republican Gov. Chris Sununu while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also probably reelecting</a> Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. In Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is locked in a tight reelection battle</a> in what is otherwise a red state, but Republican Sen. Jerry Moran <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should handily win reelection</a>. (These states are notable in that the incumbents are of different parties — more on that later.) But we expect to see a single-digit difference between the Senate and governor races in most states. In some cases, that might even mean nearly zero variation, as our projected vote margin for Nevada shows both Democratic incumbents running in essentially dead heats. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, should the 2022 results in these states mirror our projected vote margins — and they largely did in 2018 — this midterm will likely feature the smallest median gap between concurrent Senate and gubernatorial races in midterms dating back to 1990.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at midterm elections not only because 2022 is a midterm, but because 36 of the 50 states elect governors in midterms, so midterms are where the concurrent Senate-governor elections mostly occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> The 2022 estimated median would be even lower than the 2018 median, which had already set a modern record with a median difference of about 10 points. The overall decline in split-ticket voting isn’t limited to only Senate and governor races, either: In 2020, most Senate and House races <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t differ markedly</a> from the presidential vote in their state or district. </p>

The Democratic and Republican parties <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have grown farther apart ideologically</a>, and voters <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/the-partisan-landscape-and-views-of-the-parties/#fn-20071486-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are increasingly likely to say</a> that there are sizable differences between the parties. At the same time, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/interactives/political-polarization-1994-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters’ political views have also become more polarized</a>, with more Democrats becoming consistently liberal and more Republicans becoming more consistently conservative. And because of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative partisanship</a>, voters are now more inclined to dislike the other party out of hand, making them less likely to consider voting for a candidate from the opposite party under any condition. These developments have left the country with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/just-how-many-swing-voters-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer swing voters than ever</a>; despite the large number of Americans who claim to be independent, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-americans-who-identify-as-independent-are-actually-independent-thats-really-bad-for-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most in fact prefer one side</a>. More broadly, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics are more nationalized</a>, which has reduced regional variation in elections for Senate or governor, making it less likely that ruby-red Alabama will elect a Democratic governor (<a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1998&amp;fips=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last happened in 1998</a>) or that deep-blue New York will elect a Republican senator (<a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=36&amp;year=1992&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;class=3&amp;elect=0&amp;minper=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last happened in 1992</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other factors such as incumbency also play into the differences between Senate and gubernatorial margins. While incumbency <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912919883696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not as powerful a boost</a> as it once was, we still expect incumbents to perform better than non-incumbents. In races where different parties have incumbents defending the Senate and governor seats, you’ll tend to see a larger gap, like in Georgia, Kansas or New Hampshire, as the appeal of each incumbent will encourage voters to split their tickets. You’ll also see some sizable differences in states where one race doesn’t have an incumbent, such as Ohio and Vermont, as the absence of the incumbency advantage in one race can mean the national environment and partisan baseline of the state will exert a stronger influence on its result. By contrast, in states with incumbents from the same party in both races, you’ll generally see smaller differences between the two.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Important state-to-state differences can come into play here, too. A decade ago, FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/swing-voters-and-elastic-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced the concept</a> of “elastic” and “inelastic” states, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refers to how sensitive a state is</a> to changes in the national political environment and the relative swinginess of the state. We’d expect a more elastic state to have more variation in its voting preferences from year to year, and more variation from race to race in the same year. In the table below, we lay out FiveThirtyEight’s elasticity scores by state, which are used in our forecast. Tellingly, New Hampshire and Vermont are right near the top of the list.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Together, these national, state and candidate forces can influence how many voters split tickets for Senate and governor. Despite the recent decline in split-ticket voting, however, the small share of voters who do split their votes remains critically important. Take Georgia, a pretty inelastic state that currently projects to have about an 8-point difference between its Senate and gubernatorial races, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would rank as one of the state’s largest gaps</a> in recent memory. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who leads in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average</a> by roughly 6 points, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks more certain</a> to win <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock</a>, who <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads by about 4 points</a>. But <em>if</em> that gap largely holds, it probably makes a Warnock victory more likely because it suggests at least a few Georgia voters plan to split their votes between Warnock and Kemp. If the gap narrows, however, the races are more likely to run closely together, which could help Republicans win both races in what remains a somewhat GOP-leaning state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we get closer to Election Day, many factors will affect how these races play out, and even if the number of split-ticket voters is smaller, they can still shape who wins the Senate and gubernatorial contests in these states. So watch how big or small these gaps prove to be on Election Day, as they’ll tell us more about just how willing voters are to back different parties for major offices, a sign of just how partisan things could become.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">During the reapportionment process after the 2020 census, Colorado was awarded an additional congressional district, giving it a total of eight. This new district was designed <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as fairly competitive</a> and indeed has the hallmarks of being tough to predict in November: The southern part of the district encompasses a portion of the Denver suburbs and includes a <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/data/colorados-8th-congressional-district-will-be-the-most-competitive-hispanic-in-the-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large Latino population</a>, who <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2016/10/11/latinos-and-the-political-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically supports Democrats</a>, while its northern counties are much more rural and Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this district isn’t a pure toss-up. The 8th District leans very slightly<em> </em>toward the GOP, with a partisan lean of R+3,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> and right now, Republican candidate Barbara Kirkmeyer has a more than 2-in-3 chance of capturing the Centennial State’s newest district, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/colorado/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> And this district has a few quirks that could make it a winner for the GOP, including its demographics, each party’s candidates and national interest in the race. As a result, this district could be another disappointment for Democrats — who are expected, at least by our metrics, to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose control of the U.S. House</a> following this year’s midterm elections. Let’s break down why this brand-new district is currently looking to be a red one this fall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We have only <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/house/2022/colorado/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one internal poll</a> of the race, sponsored by Democrat Yadira Caraveo, and it gives Kirkmeyer a 2-percentage-point edge. But <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2022/07/29/colorado-congress-2022-election-republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since late summer</a>, a handful of political prognosticators (including us) have moved the race more squarely in Republicans’ column.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This new district represents what is likely to be the state’s most hotly contested race — in part due to its politics and demographics. According to FiveThirtyEight data, Latino Americans make <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up nearly 35 percent of the district’s voting-age population</a> — the largest percentage for any congressional seat in the state. Typically, Latino voters favor Democrats, but it’s not clear yet whether Caraveo will benefit much from the district’s racial and ethnic makeup. In fact, voters in the district backed Democrat John Hickenlooper for Senate by <a href="https://redistricting.colorado.gov/content/congressional-final-approved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a margin of just 1.7 points</a> back in 2020, according to calculations from the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commissions. (For comparison, Hickenlooper won the state by a margin of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/colorado-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.3 points</a>.) </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The Redistricting Commissions <a href="https://redistricting.colorado.gov/content/congressional-final-approved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared results from eight recent statewide elections</a> to see how voters in the new district cast their ballots. As you can see, the 8th District is far from a stronghold for either party. Recent elections have flipped from one party to another depending on the race and consistently feature narrow margins.</p>

The district encompasses the northern suburbs of Denver, which tend to go blue, Acevedo told us, but it also includes <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2021/01/19/not-going-away-weld-county-republicans-consider-next-steps-as-democrats-take-power-in-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the conservative Weld County</a>. In contrast, he added, parts of the southernmost areas of the district are <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/latinos-largest-community-in-commerce-city-and-adams-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predominantly Latino, Democratic-leaning and low-income</a> — but it’s not a guarantee that Democrats will win this bloc. “This is where the parties have to do the work to go in and try to motivate those voters to cast ballots in their favor,” Acevedo said. “And it’s not clear to me that the Democratic Party is doing the work that’s needed.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/07/05/unaffiliated-voters-colorado-2022-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much like a significant chunk of voters in Colorado</a>, a <a href="https://redistricting.colorado.gov/content/congressional-final-approved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high share of registered voters</a> in the district (46 percent) are unaffiliated with either major political party.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data from the state&amp;#8217;s redistricting commission, as of Sept. 1, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> Of the remaining electorate, about half are registered Republicans (24 percent) or Democrats (27 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The district’s fairly even split in registration wasn’t an accident. Since 2018, the state has had an <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/colorado/?cycle=2020&amp;level=Congress&amp;startdate=2021-11-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission</a> that draws new district maps, which are then approved by the state Supreme Court. This means that Colorado’s Democratic-controlled state legislature wasn’t able to draw the new district in its favor, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/ron-desantis-drew-florida-an-extreme-gerrymander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve seen in other states</a>. Along with the addition of the new competitive district, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current map maintains</a> the old map’s four Democratic-leaning seats and three Republican-leaning seats, and has a very low efficiency gap, which suggests that few votes are wasted. Given that the party <em>not</em> in control of the White House <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tends to do better</a> in midterms, Republicans stand to benefit in this race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the high concentration of unaffiliated voters means moderation is key. An extreme candidate from either party is going to <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/11/16/colorado-new-congressional-district-go-moderate-to-win-8th-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a harder time winning here</a>, and both Kirkmeyer and Caraveo seem to have taken that to heart. Kirkmeyer is one of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minority of Republican candidates</a> who has <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/07/colorado-8th-congressional-district-republicans-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicitly denied former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims</a> of a stolen election in 2020. And while she previously promoted strict anti-abortion views, Kirkmeyer has started distancing herself from them, including <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2022/08/31/kirkmeyer-removes-abortion-campaign-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrubbing anti-abortion language</a> from her website. On the offensive side, Kirkmeyer has <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2022/watch-republican-barb-kirkmeyer-defends-oil-and-gas-industry-in-new-tv-ad-in-colorados/article_79b72a00-361b-11ed-b275-c3949c6db72c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likened her opponent</a> to progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Republicans have <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2022/04/07/no-wonder-dems-are-worried-about-co-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted a past endorsement</a> of Caraveo from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, Caraveo and her allies have repeatedly tried to needle Kirkmeyer on her abortion stance. One ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/watch-democrats-slam-kirkmeyer-over-gop-candidates-support-for-national-abortion-ban-in-new-tv/article_3fa11e0a-3e79-11ed-96f0-ffac168e2e1e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured a clip</a> of Kirkmeyer saying she “[doesn’t] agree to any exceptions to abortion,” though the Republican has <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/politics/truth-tests/truth-test-kirkmeyer-ad-cd8-election/73-488f2601-35aa-4bf6-99e5-f1b65c14649f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently endorsed one exception</a> — if the mother’s life is in danger. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But persuading voters that Kirkmeyer is a GOP extremist might be a hard sell. That’s partly because prominent Democratic groups did the opposite when they <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/16/8th-congressional-district-tv-ad-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran ads during the GOP primary</a>, attacking Kirkmeyer for not being reliably conservative. In fact, the party essentially propped up Weld County Commissioner Lori Saine, <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/06/14/8th-congressional-district-republican-primary-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a conservative firebrand</a> who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/28/us/elections/results-colorado-us-house-district-8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handily defeated</a> by Kirkmeyer in the district’s primary. (To be clear, this isn’t the first time Democrats’ involvement in a Colorado race didn’t go as planned. The party <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/09/dems-meddle-in-colorado-senate-gop-primary-00038294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented a similar tactic</a> in the GOP primary for U.S. Senate, and voters ended up choosing the more conventional GOP candidate there, too.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, the national Republican Party has heavily boosted Kirkmeyer’s candidacy. Last month, the National Republican Congressional Committee <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2022/house-republicans-book-2-6-million-in-fall-tv-ads-in-colorados-new-congressional-district/article_92686900-3054-11ed-8645-cb1b5c8e75a4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was buying $2.6 million in television advertising in the district. The Democratic House Majority PAC <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/us/politics/house-democrats-midterms-advertising.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also investing in this race</a>, but it’s primarily focusing ads in the Denver market, likely with the goal of getting out the vote in the reliably blue area. And outside spending for Kirkmeyer has eclipsed <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=CO08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caraveo’s fundraising haul</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, this race is no slam dunk for Kirkmeyer. Beyond politics and PAC money, the race might also come down to the hot-button issues 8th District voters prioritize as they head to the ballot box. The salience of these issues, like abortion access, especially following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to abortion, could boost Caraveo. A recent poll from <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2022/08/31/poll-colorado-latino-voters-support-abortion-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnidosUS/Mi Familia Vota/BSP Research</a> found that an overwhelming majority of Latino voters in Colorado (74 percent) believed that abortion should remain legal, regardless of their personal beliefs on the matter. The flip side is that <em>other</em> issues are more important to Latinos in Colorado, <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/housing-costs-top-list-of-colorado-voters-concerns-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like inflation</a> (their No. 1 issue, according to the poll), which could help Kirkmeyer since voters tend to trust Republicans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/03/economy-inflation-top-of-mind-for-midterm-voters-giving-gop-slight-edge-in-new-monmouth-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more on economic issues</a>.<strong> </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the end, the outcome of Colorado’s newest district may not come down to anything more complicated than the fact that it’s a toss-up seat in a midterm election environment that favors Republicans. Mystery solved.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Want to influence state laws and elections? Attorney general or secretary of state is the job for you! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the U.S., the attorney general is a state’s top law-enforcement official, and the secretary of state is the head election official in most states. Secretaries of state became part of the mainstream consciousness when former President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the 2020 election was rigged against him. The office is typically responsible for implementing a state’s voting procedures and certifying elections. Meanwhile, attorneys general are the ones who decide whether to <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/wi-attorney-general-says-he-will-not-enforce-abortion-ban-if-roe-v-wade-overturned/40399979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enforce an abortion ban</a> or file a lawsuit against President Biden’s administration to block policies on <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/28/texas-paxton-lawsuit-biden-asylum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration reform</a>, <a href="https://wpde.com/news/local/sc-attorney-general-alan-wilson-17-state-coalition-suing-biden-administration-protect-second-amendment-gun-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gun control</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/09/29/republicans-student-loan-forgiveness-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">student-loan forgiveness</a>.<br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The majority of attorney-general and secretary-of-state offices are on the ballot in 2022, 30 of the former and 27 of the latter. But we think only 20 of these races are worth keeping an eye on. That’s because the others are mostly either safely Republican or safely Democratic.<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exception is the Wisconsin secretary of state election. We aren’t watching that race since the office is largely ceremonial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> Many of these races could also determine the future of voting rights and abortion access in many parts of the U.S. And while we don’t forecast attorney general and secretary of state races like we do for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House, Senate and governor</a>, we’ll have updates on some of these races between now and Election Day. But first, here’s a lay of the land.</p>



<h2><strong>The closest races</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <strong>Nevada</strong> secretary of state’s race is one of the closest in the country. The most recent poll, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/politics/cnn-poll-arizona-nevada-senate-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a>, found that 46 percent of likely voters favored former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, the Republican candidate, and 43 percent supported attorney Cisco Aguilar, the Democrat — within the survey’s margin of error. Aguilar has also raised more than twice as much as Marchant (<a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/soscandidateservices/anonymousaccess/ViewCCEReport.aspx?syn=KDRMWFhEtgNdct%252b7gZqzBg%253d%253d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.1 million</a> to <a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/soscandidateservices/anonymousaccess/ViewCCEReport.aspx?syn=iNHRjYR2mLvolDzfd4fT6w%253d%253d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$437,000</a>) to help close that gap. Marchant, meanwhile, is one of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven election deniers</a> running for secretary of state nationwide<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The others are Chuck Gray of Wyoming (almost certain to win), H. Brooke Paige of Vermont (almost certain to lose) and four candidates we’ll introduce later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> and arguably one of the most extreme. He <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/29/election-denier-secretary-state-mail-voting-00054018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposes electronic voting machines</a> and has said he wants to “wipe out the voter rolls completely and then have everybody re-register,” which would be illegal. He also believes that elections have been rigged for <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-debates-secretary-of-state-candidates-cast-wildly-different-visions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades</a> despite all evidence to the contrary.</p>

By contrast, Democratic candidate Adrian Fontes, the former top election official of Arizona’s largest county, aggressively tried to <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2020/03/13/maricopa-county-mailing-ballots-democratic-presidential-preference-tuesday-election-coronavirus/5044933002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand voting access</a> in 2020.

And Finchem has handily outraised Fontes <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2023%7COfficeID=2010%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million to $700,000</a>. Still, the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State is planning to <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2022/09/29/national-democrats-spend-big-arizona-support-adrian-fontes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend millions</a> on the race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Several races for attorney general are also too close to identify a leader. In Arizona, an average of two partisan surveys (<a href="https://endcitizensunited.org/latest-news/press-releases/new-arizona-poll-attorney-general-and-secretary-of-state-races-are-neck-and-neck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one Democratic</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AZ-Gen-0918-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one Republican</a>) from mid-September gave Republican attorney Abraham Hamadeh a 4.5-point lead. Hamadeh, 31, is a political novice who has also made <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/15/abe-hamadeh-kris-mayes-answer-criticisms-arizona-attorney-general-race/10391364002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Semitic remarks</a>. His Democratic opponent Kris Mayes, a former <em>Republican</em> member of the Arizona Corporation Commission, has both experience and potential crossover appeal. But both Hamadeh and Mayes have raised the same amount of money, <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2023%7COfficeID=2020%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.0 million</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Kansas</strong> has an R+21 <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/partisan-lean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a>,<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> but the state’s attorney general race is nonetheless competitive. Republicans have nominated a weak candidate in former Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Kobach’s <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-kansas-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed crusade against voter fraud</a> got him in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/18/603810241/federal-judge-holds-kris-kobach-in-contempt-of-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal hot water</a> in 2018. As a result, he is an <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/07/07/polling-for-ag-candidate-tony-mattivi-reveals-hidden-appeal-among-gop-voters-for-a-crimefighter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular figure</a> statewide. A <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/kansas-2022-democratic-governor-laura-kelly-in-tight-race-with-a-g-derek-schmidt-in-gubernatorial-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> put Kobach and former police officer Chris Mann, the Democratic candidate, in a virtual tie, with 41 percent of likely Kansas voters supporting Kobach and 39 percent supporting Mann.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the <strong>Iowa</strong> attorney general’s race is a direct clash between tradition and change. Democratic incumbent Tom Miller has served for 38 years and is the longest-serving attorney general in U.S. history. But Iowa has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/something-funny-happened-in-iowa-and-it-may-hurt-democrats-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved</a> into a Republican-leaning state over the past decade. Guthrie County Attorney Brenna Bird, the Republican candidate, hopes that 2022 will be the year that the power of partisanship is finally greater than Miller’s personal brand. The <a href="https://taxrelief.org/poll-strong-support-for-republicans-voters-focused-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> put Bird at 46 percent and Miller at 43 percent. The poll, however, was sponsored by a pro-Republican group, so it may have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too generous to the GOP</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Swing-state <strong>Georgia</strong> will not have an election denier running its 2024 election. In May, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/raffensperger-wins-republican-primary-for-georgia-secretary-of-state/NDTWJ5JHGBEK3KI6MSWZ5NGPXY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated</a> his Trump-endorsed challenger in the Republican primary. Raffensperger’s famous refusal to “<a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/01/03/trump-georgia-election-officials-i-just-want-find-11780-votes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find 11,780 votes</a>” to flip Georgia to Trump in 2020 earned him <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1334509428549312512?s=20&amp;t=4hsReRVo1RUSwL-Ezso_Ig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan respect</a>. That should help him defeat Democratic state Rep. Bee Nguyen in November. An average of two <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-trump-target-raffensperger-dominating-race-for-reelection/2UNCKODYAJASHFGLIRP7T6EA7A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=e363ce46-6a44-4584-9c5b-3c271473b1ba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> gave Raffensperger an 11-point lead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the Georgia attorney general’s race, Republican incumbent Chris Carr rejected Trump’s false claims of voter fraud, but that campaign has <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2022/09/07/georgia-attorney-general-race-carr-jordan-battle-over-abortion-voting-issues/7945225001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused more on abortion</a>. Carr has defended Georgia’s six-week abortion ban in court. His Democratic opponent, state Sen. Jen Jordan, meanwhile, first rose to prominence with an emotional speech opposing the law in the legislature. According to those same two polls, Carr has an average lead of 7 points for now, but Georgia is a competitive state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a similar story in <strong>Florida</strong>, another perennially competitive state. We can’t write it off completely, but it’s hard to imagine Attorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican, losing to former state Attorney Aramis Ayala, the Democratic candidate. Moody led a <a href="https://cloudup.com/iWr3mJo7Brk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Mason-Dixon poll</a> by 13 points and has raised <a href="https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/campaign-finance/contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.0 million</a> compared to Ayala’s <a href="https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/campaign-finance/contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$162,000</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, <strong>Texas</strong> Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, has made a lot of bad headlines over the years. In 2015, he was <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2015/08/03/paxton-set-surrender-securities-fraud-indictment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicted</a> for alleged security fraud (charges that have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/years-trial-texas-ag-ken-paxton-84903414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still not gone to trial</a>). In 2020, the FBI reportedly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ken-paxton-austin-texas-crime-f8413d14842d848e69cf81bb4d2e87e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started investigating him</a> on unrelated bribery allegations and using his office to benefit a wealthy donor. He was also a leading figure in the <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-sues-battleground-states-unconstitutional-changes-2020-election-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> seeking to overturn the 2020 election in four swing states. That all has made him one of the most endangered Texas Republicans in the 2022 election. But Texas is still Texas. No Democrat has won any statewide office in the Lone Star State <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1REYGxQTXblXMHmWuyRiYbbaRlhezrFmMfyNJQwGioYU/edit#gid=711118416" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1994</a>. According to a <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Spectrum-Texas-Sept-2022-PR-Draft-7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siena College and Spectrum News</a> poll, Paxton led Democratic attorney Rochelle Garza 47 percent to 42 percent among likely Texas voters.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1229437484-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1229437484-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1229437484-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1229437484-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson enjoys a fundraising and polling lead over her challenger, GOP nominee Kristina Karamo. <p>KENT NISHIMURA / LOS ANGELES TIMES / GETTY IMAGES</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Where Democrats are favored</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The first two races in this category could be considered toss-ups. But, as things stand today, we think Democrats have an identifiable advantage. While we couldn’t find a single poll of the <strong>Wisconsin</strong> attorney general’s race, which could <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/14/wisconsin-attorney-general-election-candidates-abortion-law-after-roe-v-wade-overturned/7755800001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determine the fate of abortion rights</a> in the Badger State, Democratic incumbent Josh Kaul has raised <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0105879SeptemberReport202241cb09272022100539PMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 million</a>, compared to the <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0106408SeptemberReport2022452a99272022113910PMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$249,000</a> raised by Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney, a Republican. Similarly, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FMgbnIJWR3zoCnMfSk9ft4EcHQOuJ_Q5/edit#gid=644494231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only</a> <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/587943724/RGJ-Suffolk-Poll-Cross-Tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> of the <strong>Nevada</strong> attorney general’s election have an unhelpfully large number of undecided voters. But Democratic incumbent Aaron Ford has raised <a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/soscandidateservices/anonymousaccess/ViewCCEReport.aspx?syn=dTVlO%252fJybY8Kns9ofc4h4w%253d%253d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.9 million</a> compared to the $666,000 raised by attorney Sigal Chattah, the Republican candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, the two races in <strong>Michigan</strong> are arguably solidly Democratic. However, we’re still watching them since Michigan has a purple hue. Incumbent Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, has raised <a href="https://cfrsearch.nictusa.com/documents/531660/details/filing/summary?changes=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.2 million</a> compared to Republican Kristina Karamo’s <a href="https://cfrsearch.nictusa.com/documents/531875/details/filing/summary?changes=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$907,000</a>. Benson also led by an average of 12 points in <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2022/10/04/nessel-benson-widen-leads-over-republican-challengers-struggling-with-name-id/69535428007/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three</a> <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MI-Gen-Gov-Poll-Report-0930.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://ssl2002.webhosting.comcast.net/epic-mra/press/Statewide_Sept2022_Media_Freq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a>. Karamo, a former community college professor, is another <a href="https://boltsmag.org/kristina-karamo-has-plans-to-unwind-michigan-elections-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-blown election denier</a> seeking to be her state’s top election official. She could use the office to make it harder to vote or to investigate voter-fraud claims, which would be referred to the attorney general for prosecution. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The GOP candidate in the race for Michigan attorney general is also an election denier: Attorney Matthew DePerno legally challenged the 2020 results in Michigan’s Antrim County and is <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/deperno-others-linked-vote-machine-tampering-case-headed-special-prosecutor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under investigation</a> (at the request of his opponent, Democratic incumbent Dana Nessel) for allegedly tampering with voting machines. But he’ll have a hard time defeating Nessel. She has raised $4.2 million compared to <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/26/nessel-maintains-big-fundraising-lead-over-deperno-in-ag-race/69519843007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DePerno’s $763,000</a> and leads by 10 points in <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2022/10/04/nessel-benson-widen-leads-over-republican-challengers-struggling-with-name-id/69535428007/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those</a> <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MI-Gen-Gov-Poll-Report-0930.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three</a> <a href="https://ssl2002.webhosting.comcast.net/epic-mra/press/Statewide_Sept2022_Media_Freq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The threat to democracy may be more severe in <strong>Minnesota</strong>. The North Star State has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 straight elections</a>. But Kim Crockett, the Republican candidate for secretary of state who has <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/05/25/minnesota-gop-endorses-election-denier-to-oversee-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called the 2020 election rigged</a>, trails Democratic incumbent Steve Simon just 45 percent to 42 percent in an average of <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/kstp-surveyusa-poll-3-statewide-races-all-toss-ups-with-a-month-to-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three</a> <a href="https://alphanews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MN-Gen-Poll-Report-0918.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-poll-results-attorney-general-secretary-of-state-ellison-schultz-marijuana-sports-betting/600207474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a>. That said, Democrats are throwing money at this race: Simon has raised <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/campaign-finance/candidates/17653/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a>, and Democratic outside groups have committed <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/elections/2022/10/so-much-for-a-sleepy-secretary-of-state-race-simon-crockett-contest-attracts-national-headlines-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 million more</a> to TV ads. Crockett, by contrast, has raised a total of <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/campaign-finance/candidates/18732/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$323,000</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The better opportunity for Minnesota Republicans may be the race for attorney general. It was the state’s closest statewide election in 2018, and Democratic incumbent Keith Ellison’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/09/05/george-floyd-reckoning-democrat-crime-00054711" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been targeted</a> for his outspoken progressivism. In an average of the three recent polls of Minnesota voters, Ellison and Republican Jim Schultz, an attorney, are tied at 46 percent each. However, Ellison has raised <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/campaign-finance/candidates/18336/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.4 million</a> compared to Schultz’s <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/campaign-finance/candidates/18731/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$885,000</a>. That, along with his incumbency and Minnesota’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-minnesota-could-be-the-next-midwestern-state-to-go-red/?ex_cid=story-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light-blue hue</a>, gives Ellison a boost.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans are getting frisky in a few other light-blue states too, though probably not enough to win. In <strong>New Mexico</strong>, Republican Jeremy Gay, a Marine veteran, recently released a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9txbf7moig62386/Jeremy%20Gay%20Polling%20Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cygnal poll</a> that showed him statistically tied with Bernalillo County District Attorney Raúl Torrez, a Democrat, in the attorney general’s race. But internal polls tend to be too good to be true, and Torrez has raised <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/index.html#/exploreDetails/FuFj2UgZv9jij3XuwDf9pn1lK5MpzTLbNw12UnzEQ-I1/10/0/119/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.6 million</a> compared to Gay’s <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/index.html#/exploreDetails/DdAjvqiu3qyEIk2cwywqVX1lK5MpzTLbNw12UnzEQ-I1/10/0/119/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$344,000</a>. Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, has pulled in a less impressive <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/index.html#/exploreDetails/i6Rr92sWQ8pC8ve8W5XvmH1lK5MpzTLbNw12UnzEQ-I1/7/0/119/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$466,000</a>. But her Republican opponent, small-business owner Audrey Trujillo, has just <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/index.html#/exploreDetails/JKb4_A7zBxBu3QBTwm6lkX1lK5MpzTLbNw12UnzEQ-I1/7/0/119/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$73,000</a> in contributions. Trujillo has also shared a plethora of <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2022/10/04/experts-alarmed-by-gop-secretary-of-state-candidates-conspiracy-theorizing-in-nm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conspiracy theories</a> about the 2020 election, COVID-19 vaccines, mass shootings and Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the Republican candidates in <strong>Colorado</strong> are more moderate. District Attorney John Kellner, running for attorney general, says he would <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/08/10/attorney-general-republican-candidate-john-kellner-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect abortion access in the state</a>, while former Jefferson County Clerk Pam Anderson, running for secretary of state, has said that the 2020 election was <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/08/2022-republican-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free and fair</a>. But <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?SeqID=52137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither</a> has <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?Type=CA&amp;SeqID=52902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> more than $300,000, so they’ll probably need a “red wave” to carry them across the finish line. Democratic incumbents Attorney General Phil Weiser and Secretary of State Jena Griswold have each raised <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?SeqID=47921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around</a> <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?SeqID=47921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 million</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, no Republican is running for secretary of state in <strong>Washington</strong>, but Democrats could still lose. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/inslee-selects-sen-steve-hobbs-to-temporarily-replace-wyman-as-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed</a> incumbent Steve Hobbs, the first Democrat to hold the office since 1964, after Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman resigned to join the Biden administration. So this will be the first time voters weigh in on Hobbs, who is running against Pierce County Auditor Julie Anderson, an independent. Anderson has <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/sep/25/candidates-for-washington-secretary-of-state-disag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two key advantages</a>. She has experience as the top election administrator of Washington’s second-largest county, and she’s not a Republican, which could make more people willing to vote for her in this blue state. That said, Hobbs is still the one with the “D” beside his name, and he’s outraised Anderson to boot, <a href="https://www.pdc.wa.gov/political-disclosure-reporting-data/browse-search-data/candidates/567322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$640,000</a> to <a href="https://www.pdc.wa.gov/political-disclosure-reporting-data/browse-search-data/candidates/567378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$298,000</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Long an afterthought, elections for attorney general and secretary of state have been thrust to the forefront thanks to recent debates over election integrity, abortion and more. As a result, these 20 races may determine the fate of free and fair elections and the rule of law in their states. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Crossing the northern border suddenly looked a lot more tempting on June 24. When the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/06/demonstrators-converge-outside-supreme-court-after-dobbs-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released its ruling</a> in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization at 10:10 that morning — invalidating its landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade — Google searches for “how to move to Canada from U.S.” <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/06/25/after-the-ruling-americans-ask-google-how-to-move-to-canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spiked 850 percent</a> in the hour afterward, according to Simon Rogers’s Google Trends newsletter. And queries on “how to become a Canadian citizen” jumped 550 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Amidst the chaos and emotion of the Dobbs decision, this trend marked the reemergence of a common American sentiment: the threat to pack up and head to Canada when political events don’t turn out one’s way. In 2016, Democrats famously vowed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/move-to-canada-trump-election-immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leave if Donald Trump won</a> the presidency, and the pattern goes back further, during <a href="https://time.com/4245100/move-to-canada-americans-trump-bush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George W. Bush’s time in office</a>, for example. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.timesherald.com/2008/11/14/yes-we-canada-republicans-consider-move-north/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservatives eyed the nation to the north</a> <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/disgruntled-americans-threaten-move-canada-obama-victory-062354107.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after Barack Obama was elected</a> president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, nearly 2 in 5 American citizens (38 percent) say they’ve considered leaving the U.S. for good at least at some point in their lives, according to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/g43s025yft/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a YouGov survey</a> conducted in January. That share rises to 45 percent among Americans under 45 and to 59 percent among self-identified liberals. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the fall of Roe may have spurred interest in Canada, it ultimately turned abortion into a state-by-state issue, meaning Americans don’t have to leave the country to live somewhere with better access to reproductive health care. Instead, media coverage has suggested that the issue could affect movement between<em> </em>states, with stories speculating how the decision might determine where young Americans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/how-roes-end-is-changing-millennials-career-plans-and-lives.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settle down</a>, large corporations <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2022/06/24/how-the-tech-landscape-could-change-if-abortion-laws-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establish their offices</a> and college students <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/07/22/state-abortion-access-college-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attend school</a>. But recent history has shown that politically driven mass migration in the U.S. is more a conversation topic than an actual trend. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><hr><span></span></div>
 



<p data-paragraph="main">Data suggests that most past pledges to move to Canada didn’t pan out. For example, after Trump’s election in 2016, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/reports-statistics/statistics-open-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a>, which tracks immigration into the country, found that only 655 more Americans gained permanent residence in Canada in 2017 than in 2016 — that’s just 9,140 people versus 8,485. And while 2018 numbers ticked up slightly to 10,900, they generally plateaued in 2019. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">To be fair, <a href="https://www.move.org/moving-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving can be expensive</a> — on the order of thousands of dollars, even for a local relocation, according to industry experts — making this an unfeasible option for many Americans. Uprooting your everyday life to potentially gain access to a specific kind of health care isn’t an investment a lot of people can make. And those who can afford to do so are also more likely to be able to travel across state lines in a health care emergency, making the case to move in light of stricter abortion laws less urgent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even when Americans do move, they don’t go far. In fact, an overwhelming number don’t live that far from their hometown. That includes young people, one of the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/245789/record-numbers-americans-leave.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely demographic groups to say they want to move</a> and perhaps among the most flexible in being able to lay down new roots. A Center for Economic Studies <a href="https://www2.census.gov/ces/wp/2022/CES-WP-22-27.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research paper</a> released in July, for example, found that 80 percent of young Americans live within 100 miles of where they grew up, and 58 percent live within just 10 miles.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using de-identified administrative and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau as well as tax data, researchers limited their analysis to children born in the U.S. from 1978 to 1992 and found that at age 26, 69 percent lived in the commuting zone where they grew up, 58 percent lived within 10 miles, 80 percent lived within 100 miles, and 90 percent lived within 500 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that data implies that local moving patterns, especially around increasingly progressive cities situated in more conservative states, may be worth a closer look. The level of political diversity within states has become easy to spot on electoral maps — clusters of blue in major metropolitan areas like Atlanta, Nashville and Austin, for example, amidst redder spreads throughout the states of Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. Comparing these cities with their states may reveal more than comparing, say, all of California to all of Texas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This idea of ‘red state versus blue state’ misses a great deal of heterogeneity within states, as well as clusters and spatial patterns that occur within states,” said Ryan Strickler, a political scientist at Colorado State University, Pueblo. “Instead, we’re seeing more of a micro level of political sorting.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while there has been a lot of buzz about New Yorkers or San Franciscans flocking to smaller Southern cities, especially during the pandemic, that trend doesn’t represent the norm for most Americans, as a majority continue to stay tethered close to where they grew up. Even <a href="https://educationdata.org/college-enrollment-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most college students stay in-state</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, experts say the more significant phenomenon is people moving within the same state where they can find others who are politically like-minded. These migrations aren’t about specific political outcomes like the Dobbs decision. Instead, they’re linked to social polarization. “There’s a lot of local reshuffling,” said Alexander Bendeck, a Ph.D. student in the Georgia Institute of Technology’s School of Interactive Computing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In one of his current projects, Bendeck explores U.S. relocation patterns in the 2010s, using population migration data from the IRS to track the number of migrants between counties nationwide. Bendeck recognized the shift in migration from the coasts to the South or Midwest but also emphasized the effects of moving within metropolitan areas. Many natives of major Southern cities have moved out to the suburbs or to smaller cities. And the locals of those suburbs or cities move to more rural areas or even smaller cities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a huge caveat to any migration data: It is impossible to attribute all instances of relocation, even within the same state, to politics. In fact, politics has not been a major factor why most Americans have moved in recent history, Strickler said. Instead, migration is more financially driven, whether people are seeking out a lower cost of living, better job prospects or proximity to family. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that trend may be shifting. “People could be choosing places to move that are correlated with partisanship, even if it’s not explicitly all because of partisanship,” Strickler said. Assessing how abortion in particular affects geographic polarization will take years, and there will likely be compounding factors swaying Americans seeking a life somewhere more in line with their partisanship. Any effort to monitor this phenomenon, though, will need to venture beyond just red state versus blue state. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the last midterm elections, Democratic women won a historic number of congressional races. Two years later, the GOP had its own “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2020-could-be-the-new-year-of-the-woman-for-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year of the Woman</a>.” But now that the 2022 primaries are long over, we can say that any signs that Republican women would continue to gain on their Democratic counterparts were likely a flash in the pan, not a watershed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight, with an assist from political scientists Bernard Fraga and Hunter Rendleman, collected a trove of demographic and political information (such as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressives-democrats-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-candidates-race-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race and ethnicity</a> and gender) for every major-party candidate running in a Senate, House and governor’s race this cycle. Based on our analysis of this data, the share of women running for office this November is lower than it was in 2020 (with one type of office serving as a notable exception). Both parties have passed on opportunities to add more women to their ranks. But Democrats have provided more opportunities for female politicians than Republicans — thanks in part to divisions in the GOP’s infrastructure for electing women.</p>



<h2><strong>How many women are running and winning?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, women remain underrepresented in politics. Women are 51 percent of the voting-age population in the U.S., but only 27 percent of candidates who ran in primaries for Senate, House or governor this cycle were women.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest were men except Paperboy Love Prince, a Democratic candidate for New York’s 7th Congressional District, who is nonbinary. They did not win their primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> This is not because 3-in-10 candidates in each party are women: As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2020-could-be-the-new-year-of-the-woman-for-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been the norm</a> for a few decades, women made up a larger share of Democratic candidates than Republican candidates. There are many explanations for this persistent disparity. For instance, the potential candidate pool for Democrats is larger, as <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/womens-representation-and-the-gendered-pipeline-to-power/8865503038A92830047B4DB0481787A1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pipelines to political office</a> are occupied by more Democratic than Republican women, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/18/men-and-women-in-the-u-s-continue-to-differ-in-voter-turnout-rate-party-identification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more women identify as Democrats than Republicans</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This cycle, among candidates who advanced to the general election,<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alaska, California and Washington hold all-party primaries, meaning multiple candidates from the same party can make the November ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> women made up 43 percent of Democratic nominees and 20 percent of Republican nominees. This was a slight decline <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-women-than-ever-are-running-for-office-but-are-they-winning-their-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared to 2020</a>,<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Aug. 25, 2020, when we conducted our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> when women were 47 percent of Democratic nominees and 22 percent of Republican nominees. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the share of female nominees declined compared to last cycle, women still overperformed in Democratic primaries this year, meaning they make up a larger share of Democratic nominees than they did of Democratic primary candidates. Meanwhile, the percentage of Republican women who won their primaries was essentially the same as the share of women in the overall Republican candidate pool.  </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This trend gets more complicated if you look beyond Congress, as women from both parties <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/2022-primaries-are-over-heres-what-you-need-know-about-women-nominees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke records</a> in gubernatorial races. Among Democrats, women were 30 percent of the gubernatorial candidate pool but 44 percent of nominees. Among Republicans, women constituted 20 percent of the candidate pool but 24 percent of nominees. This is remarkable because while women have increased their representation in Congress and state legislatures for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-women-are-holding-political-office-but-not-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last several election cycles</a>, governors’ mansions have been more of a challenge. There are still 19 states that have yet to have a female governor. But this year, three of those 19 states could elect their first female governor: Arkansas, Colorado and Georgia. (According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders is almost certain to win in Arkansas. But Republican Heidi Ganahl in Colorado and Democrat Stacey Abrams in Georgia are underdogs.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">In five other states — Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Michigan and Oregon — both majority-party nominees are women, guaranteeing a female governor (though not the first in any of these states). In Oregon, there is even a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive three-way race</a> between female candidates: Democrat Tina Kotek, Republican Christine Drazan and independent Betsy Johnson. Of the 36 governors races this cycle, a woman will be on the general election ballot in 20. </p>



<h2><strong>How racially diverse are women candidates?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">White men are still the largest share of candidates and nominees for both parties, and both parties ran and nominated far more white men than white women. But, interestingly, there is more gender parity among candidates of other races.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on candidate race and ethnicity was collected by political scientists Bernard Fraga and Hunter Rendleman. They relied on statements made by candidates, membership in racial and ethnic caucuses or organizations, racial and ethnic advocacy organizations, news articles and candidate websites. This research is, by nature, not comprehensive — for example, Fraga and Rendleman were unable to confirm some candidates’ racial identities — but the data is close enough to identify important trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> For example, according to Fraga and Rendleman’s data, Republicans nominated almost as many Latinas as Latinos. And Democrats nominated more Black women than Black men. That’s notable given how Black women are often considered the “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/21/politics/black-women-voters-michigan/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backbone</a>” of the Democratic Party.</p>

<h2><strong>How many women won primaries without incumbents?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Incumbents are disproportionately men. Incumbents also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost always win reelection</a>. So female candidates tend to have the best shot in open seats. But women in 2022 aren’t succeeding in incumbent-less primaries at nearly the same rate they did in 2020 or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-primaries-candidates-demographics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, women constituted 40 percent of the candidate pool in incumbent-less Democratic primaries and 57 percent of the party’s nominees. This year, women made up just 35 percent of the party’s candidates in incumbent-less primaries and 44 percent of its nominees. Those are practically the same numbers as the topline Democratic numbers in all primaries (including those in which incumbents ran). In other words, open seats were a boon to Democratic women in 2020; this year, not as much. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other side, if Republicans want to elect more women, they could either fix their pipeline problem or elect a higher share of the women candidates who run. But, according to our data, since 2020, they have made no progress on the former and have taken a step back on the latter. In 2020, women made up 24 percent of all candidates in GOP primaries without an incumbent and 32 percent of the winners. This year, though, women made up 23 percent of the candidates and just 23 percent of nominees.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The story is the same if you look at incumbent-less primaries that pitted at least one man against at least one woman. Women won 57 percent of such Democratic primaries — enough to get the party closer to gender parity, but still below 2020, when women won 73 percent of such head-to-head primaries. And while women won 50 percent of such Republican primaries in 2020, they won just 37 percent this year. </p>



<h2><strong>How important are endorsements from women’s groups?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another reason Democrats nominate more women than Republicans is that groups that recruit, train and support women are <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/abs/standing-on-their-shoulders-suffragists-womens-pacs-and-demands-for-womens-representation/256DE92B071304770292E1C5C362560D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more integrated into their party’s networks</a>. EMILY’s List, for instance, has deep pockets and has influenced primaries for decades by recruiting and financially supporting qualified and experienced women early in their primaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The GOP also has organizations that aim to elect more women. Still, they are <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/698848" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less integrated into their party’s donor networks</a> and have less influence. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/01/14/women-and-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican voters</a> have also made less of a push to prioritize electing women. In 2018, the now third-ranking Republican in the House, Rep. Elise Stefanik, started E-PAC to support a bench of female candidates, a move that <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Stefanik-rolls-out-PAC-committed-to-electing-more-13542939.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially received pushback</a> from the party. However, the party and E-PAC eventually made amends, and their candidates <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-women-than-ever-are-running-for-office-but-are-they-winning-their-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did well in 2020 primaries</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We looked at the candidates endorsed by EMILY’s List and four Republican women’s groups in the 2022 incumbent-less primaries and how often they won. Unsurprisingly, EMILY’s List had the best win rate of the five groups, exceeding its 2020 win rate of 84 percent. EMILY’s List also endorsed two candidates running against incumbents: Jessica Cisneros, who challenged Rep. Henry Cuellar in Texas, and Nellie Gorbea, who challenged Gov. Daniel McKee in Rhode Island. (Both women lost.) </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">We also looked at four Republican women’s groups: </p>



<ul><li>E-PAC is more aligned with former President Donald Trump’s wing of the party (it supported Trump’s endorsees more often than the other women’s groups).</li><li>Maggie’s List characterizes its ideology as fiscally conservative.</li><li>Winning for Women characterizes itself as “right of center.”</li><li>VIEW PAC’s mission is to elect “credible, serious, electable” women to federal office.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">Among the Republican groups, E-PAC had the strongest record in primaries without incumbents on the ballot: 79 percent of its endorsed candidates advanced to the general election (although this was not as good as E-PAC’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-women-than-ever-are-running-for-office-but-are-they-winning-their-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 win rate of 86 percent</a>). Winning for Women had a 67 percent win rate, down from 87 percent in 2020. Maggie’s List also had a 67 percent win rate, while VIEW PAC, which endorsed more candidates than the other Republican groups, had a 48 percent win rate.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn’t analyze the win rates of Maggie’s List or VIEW PAC in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, GOP women’s groups endorsed in a few critical races against each other. In New Hampshire’s 1st District, E-PAC supported Karoline Leavitt, but VIEW PAC supported Gail Huff Brown, and Leavitt won. In Alaska’s At-Large District, E-PAC supported Sarah Palin, while VIEW PAC supported Tara Sweeney. Both women advanced to the general election, though Sweeney <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/08/23/tara-sweeney-drops-out-of-alaska-us-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out shortly after</a>. In the Alaska Senate race, VIEW PAC backed incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski. At the same time, Maggie’s List supported Kelly Tshibaka (both advanced to the general election). Finally, in Florida’s 13th District, E-PAC supported Anna Paulina Luna, who defeated the VIEW PAC- and Maggie’s List-endorsed Amanda Makki.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This illustrates one of the many obstacles to Republicans electing more women: a lack of coordination among party elites. Of course, women are not a monolith. These endorsement disagreements may reflect existing (and growing) ideological fissures within the GOP, such as embracing Trumpism. However, the ideological winds could have been working against Republican women in other ways. According to political science research, Republican women who run for office are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/0022-3816.00019?casa_token=_5SuMi1bdxsAAAAA:rer1hAN9R5G1EgsC8F2MI7vYOjRmbAEPXY1asoPxpAysgMB-i-k7s6jG6V5cmVjROTRlqFdvs5oLQw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived as more moderate than Republican men</a>, even when they aren’t. And the perception that women are more moderate may have hurt women in Republican primaries in deep-red states, especially when they face off against a candidate with Trump’s endorsement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The GOP’s struggle to elect more women clearly has more than one root cause. But both parties still have a long way to go before they reach gender parity.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Oct. 12, 2022, 6:10 p.m.):</strong> The data originally used in this article did not include Taysha DeVaughan, the Democratic nominee for Virginia’s 9th Congressional District. The share of Democratic nominees in incumbent-less primaries who are women and the tables listing the total number of female nominees by party and each party’s share of candidates by gender and race have been corrected to reflect her addition.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On the surface, Nevada seems to validate the <a href="https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/hans-georg-betz-donald-trump-populism-republican-party-emerging-democratic-majority-us-politics-news-18211/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">otherwise somewhat unsuccessful</a> hypothesis of the 2002 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Democratic-Majority-John-Judis/dp/0743254783" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a> “The Emerging Democratic Majority.” Authors John Judis and Ruy Teixeira <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/upshot/democratic-majority-book.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> that Nevada would become a light-blue state as Democrats held onto their unionized, working-class base and demographic change brought new Democratic voters into the fold.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although Democratic nominee John Kerry narrowly lost to George W. Bush in Nevada in the following presidential election, Barack Obama carried the state by a whopping 12.5 percentage points in 2008, and Democrats have won the state in every presidential election since. Nevada’s senators, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, are both Democrats, as is its governor, Steve Sisolak, and three of its four U.S. representatives.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, Nevada is usually a pretty reliable state for Democrats, right? Well, not so fast. Cortez Masto, up for reelection this year, is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly trailing in the polling average</a> against her Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 a.m. Eastern on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> Our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast</a> has this race at about as close to 50/50 odds as it gets. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And just to be clear about the stakes here, Nevada couldn’t be much more important in determining which party controls the Senate. It is Republicans’ most likely pickup opportunity, according to FiveThirtyEight’s forecast<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 a.m. Eastern on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> — and the GOP’s second-best target, Georgia, took a big hit this week after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new allegations</a> surfaced that Republican nominee Herschel Walker paid for his then-girlfriend to get an abortion in 2009.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The math is fairly simple. If Democrats pick up a seat in Pennsylvania, where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored</a> to win, Republicans will need two pickups to gain control of the Senate, and Nevada and Georgia are the easiest targets. If Fetterman loses, they’ll need one of the two. According to our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive</a>,<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 a.m. Eastern on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> Republicans’ chances of flipping the Senate shoot up to 56 percent if they win Nevada but are just 11 percent if they don’t. So let’s take a deeper look.</p>



<h2><strong>Nevada isn’t that blue</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider Nevada’s presidential, congressional and gubernatorial elections since 2000, as the following table shows.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Several things stand out. First, although Democrats have a four-election winning streak in presidential races, their record in congressional and gubernatorial elections is checkered. Sisolak was the first Democrat elected governor there since 1994. And even though Cortez Masto’s <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_III.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class III</a> Senate seat was in Democratic hands for some time thanks to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Rosen’s <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_I.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class I</a> seat was held by Republicans between 2001 and 2019. House races in Nevada have been swingy, meanwhile. As recently as 2014, Republicans won the state’s combined popular vote for the U.S. House by 17.4 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And with the exceptions of Obama and Reid — and we’ll come back to what they had in common in a moment — Democratic wins in Nevada have been narrow. Hillary Clinton’s 2.4-point win in 2016 was similar to her national margin of victory in the popular vote — and Joe Biden’s 2.4-point win in 2020 was less than his 4.5-point national popular-vote win. Sisolak and Rosen, meanwhile, won their gubernatorial and Senate races by 4 and 5 points, respectively, in 2018, but both of them underperformed the national political environment that year, which <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored Democrats by almost 9 points</a>. Whether you call Nevada blue, red or purple is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-state-like-michigan-might-actually-be-a-blue-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">something of a semantic question</a>. But it certainly hasn’t been a <em>reliable</em> state for Democrats.</p>



<h2><strong>Nevada isn’t a great fit for the new Democratic coalition</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Paired together as tipping-point states this year, Nevada and Georgia are moving in opposite directions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Georgia has a sizable share of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/12/15/black-eligible-voters-have-accounted-for-nearly-half-of-georgia-electorates-growth-since-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black voters</a> and a multiethnic coalition of <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/community-development/publications/partners-update/2015/01/workforce-development/150210-trends-in-educational-attainment-in-atlanta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly</a> <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/in-battleground-georgia-new-voters-on-the-rise-before-22-election/W2VMBFGVXJCNVM3MIIKTMN4OYI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college-educated</a> voters in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/georgia-senate-political-geography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlanta and its suburbs</a>. The Black vote there has held up relatively well for Democrats, and they’ve been gaining ground with college-educated professionals in almost every election. If you tried to create a state in a lab where Democratic fortunes improved even as they had problems elsewhere, Georgia would be about as good a formula as you could get.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevada, on the other hand, ranks <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=S1501&amp;g=0100000US%240400000&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2021.S1501&amp;moe=false&amp;tp=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">44th in the share of adults with a college degree</a>, right between Oklahoma and Alabama. Its Black population is below the national average <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2021/08/16/census-data-shows-communities-of-color-are-the-new-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but increasing</a>. It does have a considerable share of <a href="https://naleo.org/COMMS/PRA/2022/Nevada-2022-Profile.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hispanic</a> and <a href="https://apiavote.org/wp-content/uploads/Nevada.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asian American</a> voters, but they are often working-class — subgroups that Democrats have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-appeals-to-the-working-class-are-unlikely-to-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly struggled with in recent years</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Nevada is sui generis, with several economic and demographic attributes that aren’t that common in other states. On the one hand, it has a massive workforce in the <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/gaming/Knowledge-Base/Articles/Gambling-vs-Gaming?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming</a> (gambling), leisure and hospitality industries. To give you some sense of the scale, just one hospitality and entertainment company, MGM Resorts International, employs <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/largest-companies-in-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">77,000 people in Nevada</a>, roughly as large a share of its workforce as <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/largest-companies-in-michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ford Motor Company employs in Michigan</a>. These are mostly working-class and middle-class jobs, <a href="https://unitehere.org/industry/gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often unionized</a>, often held by employees of color. But Nevada doesn’t have as many jobs in culturally progressive industries like media and technology.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, Nevada is a major destination for out-migrants from other states who are attracted to its warm weather,<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a frequent visitor to Nevada, I’ve started to buy the it’s-a-dry-heat thing! Summer is more tolerable than you’d think, and the rest of the year can be downright beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a> lack of state income tax and laissez-faire lifestyle. Only 26 percent of Nevada residents were born in Nevada, <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-nevada/nevadas-speed-of-growth-puts-silver-state-natives-in-vast-minority-1581962/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easily the lowest of any U.S. state</a>. Nevada has traditionally had a big third-party vote — it was <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/data.php?year=1992&amp;datatype=national&amp;def=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Ross Perot’s better states</a>, for instance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This latter group of voters can also be relatively apolitical. If people migrate to Colorado for its crunchy, progressive politics, and to Florida for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Man" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YOLO</a> conservatism, the prevailing attitude in Nevada is live-and-let-live, which sometimes borders on political apathy. Political participation is relatively low. Its turnout rate in 2020 was <a href="https://www.electproject.org/2020g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65.4 percent</a>, lower than the 66.8 percent in the U.S. overall — which is unusual because swing states usually have high turnout. By comparison, for instance, turnout was 71.7 percent in Florida in 2020 and 76.4 percent in Colorado.</p>



<h2><strong>Turnout could be Democrats’ saving grace</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s return to that question I teased earlier. What did Obama and Reid, the two big Democratic overperformers in Nevada, have in common? For that matter, what about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who never got to compete in a general election in Nevada but performed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/bernie-sanders-nevada-caucus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely well</a> in the state’s Democratic caucuses in 2020?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Well, Reid, Obama and Sanders relied heavily on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/nevada-democrats-lean-harry-reids-political-machine-warning-lights-fla-rcna25040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organization, turnout and the state’s union-backed Democratic machine</a>. It’s hard to know whether Cortez Masto — and Sisolak, who is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also in a very tight reelection race</a> — will be able to pull off the same. But if you have two large voting blocs in Nevada, and the more conservative of the two is somewhat politically apathetic, turnout at least potentially works to Democrats’ advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, this may be a race where Democrats need the turnout edge because the other dynamics of the campaign don’t work in their favor. Though he’s an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election denier</a> who served as one of then-President Donald Trump’s Nevada campaign chairs in 2020, Laxalt has a relatively traditional resume as the state’s former attorney general — an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-hard-to-win-a-senate-race-when-youve-never-won-an-election-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exception among Republicans</a> in competitive Senate races this year — and in recent polling, he has <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FMgbnIJWR3zoCnMfSk9ft4EcHQOuJ_Q5/edit#gid=644494231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decent personal favorability ratings</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although abortion is a strong issue for Cortez Masto in a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively irreligious state</a> like Nevada, voters in the Silver State <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FMgbnIJWR3zoCnMfSk9ft4EcHQOuJ_Q5/edit#gid=644494231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rank the economy as their top issue</a>. It’s understandable in a state that was <a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/history-a-look-at-the-housing-bubble-burst-and-long-term-impact-on-las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit hard by the housing bubble</a> and that relies on highly cyclical industries like the casino business, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/las-vegas-strip-closed-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the turnout front, a CNN/SSRS poll <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/politics/cnn-poll-arizona-nevada-senate-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a> had both good and bad news for Cortez Masto, depending on how you squint at it. In the survey, she led by 3 points among registered voters but trailed by 2 points among likely voters. Polls among likely voters are usually more reliable, and so the +2 number for Laxalt is the one in our polling average and forecast. But it does suggest a gap that could be closed by a strong turnout operation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Reid, for instance, won comfortably in 2010 despite <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/senate/nv/nevada_senate_angle_vs_reid-1517.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailing in the polling average</a>. Cortez Masto may need a little bit of Reid magic to hold onto her seat.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Last month, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/19/1123767437/joe-biden-covid-19-pandemic-over" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden said</a> what many Americans have long been thinking: “The pandemic is over.” With vaccinations, broader immunity and better treatments, the death toll from this virus is <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/09/01/a-third-covid-autumn-is-upon-us-heres-a-look-at-where-we-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nowhere near what it was</a> at the peak of the pandemic, and many Americans are returning to their pre-pandemic ways of life. As we head into the cold, flu and, most likely, COVID-19 season, as well as into an election that is about basically everything but COVID-19, we wondered: When did Americans stop caring about the coronavirus?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when public concern around the pandemic shifted for good, as there have been several inflection points. One way of seeing this is by looking at monthly surveys, like one <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Axios/Ipsos that started in March 2020</a>, to illustrate the crest and fall of Americans’ concerns around the pandemic. In the first three weeks of April 2020 — the thick of lockdown — just 19 percent of Americans said they had visited friends or relatives in the past week. That number has steadily risen over the two and a half years since, dipping occasionally when a new wave emerged. For example, an average of 62 percent of Americans said they visited friends or family during the summer of 2021, but that average dropped to 54 percent during the winter 2021 — the omicron-variant wave. And in the chart below, you can also see how the share of Americans who say they’re self-quarantining and wearing masks has declined, while the share who say they’ve returned to their pre-pandemic lives has increased:</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Americans have gotten less concerned about COVID-19" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Iyp5H/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">One switch happened in June 2022, when the share of Americans who said they’d returned to their pre-pandemic lives rose higher than the percentage who said they still wore a mask outside the home at least sometimes. National survey data from the Annenberg Public Policy Center <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/despite-awareness-of-covid-19-risks-many-americans-say-theyre-back-to-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plots a similar course</a>. In September 2021, 52 percent of Americans said they often or always wore a mask indoors when in contact with people outside their household, while just 11 percent said they never did. Those numbers plunged this year, with 27 percent of Americans in July 2022 saying they now never wore a mask, while just 11 percent said they always did. Likewise, in January 2022, 16 percent of Americans said their lives had already returned to their pre-pandemic normal, while 35 percent expected they were still more than a year away from that return. By July, 41 percent of Americans said their lives had returned to normal, and 19 percent said that normal was still a year away. Google trends also show that search interest in COVID-19 <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-03-01%202022-10-05&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fg%2F11j2cc_qll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is at a pandemic low</a>.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of data from Sept. 25 to Oct. 1, the latest set of complete data as of the time of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We can also chart this shift in attention by looking at not just the poll responses but also the poll questions. In March 2021, half of all national polls tracked by FiveThirtyEight featured at least one COVID-19-related question. That share has slowly ticked down as other issues, such as inflation, have become more prevalent. Last month, just 14 percent of polls had at least one COVID-19 question, while 22 percent asked about inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Pollsters have been asking fewer questions about COVID-19" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/U2G5L/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Starting in April 2021, you can see pollsters gradually asking more questions about other topics, while asking about COVID-19 less frequently. And largely, this tracks with Americans' views of what issues are most important to them. In April 2020, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391220/inflation-dominates-americans-economic-concerns-march.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent of Americans named the COVID-19</a> pandemic as their top concern, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Gallup</a>. And in January this year, 20 percent of Americans said the pandemic was the biggest concern, while just 8 percent said the high cost of living or inflation. By March, a higher share of Americans named inflation (17 percent) as a top concern than the share who named the pandemic (3 percent). And inflation has remained steady, with around 17 percent of Americans saying it's their top concern since this past March and an average of 37 percent of Americans listing some kind of economic issue as their top concern in the same timeframe.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The ebbing concern around COVID-19 is also reflected in the apathy around receiving booster shots. Gone are the days of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/these-vaccine-hunters-are-chasing-down-appointments-for-people-who-need-them-most" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategically logging into your local pharmacy’s</a> website at midnight to secure a vaccine appointment, or <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/29/texas-coronavirus-vaccine-rural/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving hundreds of miles</a> just to get a jab. While nearly 80 percent of Americans <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have received at least one dose</a> of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 68 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, just under 49 percent of Americans had received their first booster shot, as of Sept. 28. And <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-september-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a September poll</a> from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 51 percent of U.S. adults had heard “a little” or “nothing” about the new COVID-19 booster shot that is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-bivalent-vaccine-boosters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formulated to protect against</a> the omicron variant. In that same survey, only 5 percent said they had gotten the updated booster, while 27 percent said they plan to get it “as soon as possible.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet, as much as we all have been eager to get back to normal — and despite Biden’s proclamation — <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/hundreds-americans-dying-covid-19-day-ahead-fall/story?id=89764674" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of Americans continue to die</a> of COVID-19 every day, and many immunocompromised Americans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/us/high-risk-covid-immunocompromised.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report feeling abandoned</a> by others’ more relaxed approach to the virus these days. So it’s clear that while most Americans think the pandemic is over, many don’t yet have the luxury of that thinking.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The Supreme Court continues to suffer in the eyes of public opinion, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_093022/">according to a Monmouth University poll</a> conducted Sept. 21-25. More Americans disapproved of the job the court is doing (54 percent) than those who approved (37 percent), a trend that has held steady since May. Meanwhile, two-thirds of Americans were on board with implementing term limits for the justices, a position that enjoys relative bipartisan approval: Eighty-six percent of Democrats, 63 percent of independents and 51 percent of Republicans supported such a measure. However, the response to the idea of court expansion remains highly partisan, with 67 percent of Democrats saying they’d like to see more seats added, compared with only 30 percent of independents and 14 percent of Republicans. </li><li>Politics appear to be a lose-lose situation. A recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/10/03/growing-share-of-americans-say-their-side-in-politics-has-been-losing-more-often-than-winning/">survey from the Pew Research Center</a> found that a majority of Americans on both sides of the aisle felt that their party is losing more than winning on issues important to them, including 81 percent of Republicans and 66 percent of Democrats. That hasn’t always been the case in recent years. A majority of Republicans in 2019 (54 percent) and 2020 (69 percent) — i.e., when Donald Trump was still in office — felt their party was winning on issues more often than not. But that optimistic outlook hasn’t replicated for Democrats under Biden: Only 34 percent of conservative/moderate Democrats and 29 percent of liberal Democrats thought their party was seeing success on major issues important to them. </li><li>Just under half of Americans (45 percent) believed that young people today will experience a better standard of living than their parents, per a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-race-and-ethnicity-427d11fda282ff12e155afbdbebd35a7">UChicago Harris/AP-NORC poll</a> conducted Aug. 25-29. Young people themselves, or adults ages 18 to 44, were even less optimistic, at 39 percent. However, the breakdown looks a bit different by race. While only 41 percent of white Americans and 44 percent of Hispanic Americans had a positive outlook for the next generation, a slightly greater share of Black Americans (54 percent) held out hope for young Americans. </li><li>Americans are split on whether artificial-intelligence advancements in producing hyperrealistic art are a good thing for society, according to an Oct. 5 <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2022/10/05/58f11/1">YouGov poll</a>. And while 31 percent view such technology positively and 27 percent do so negatively, a plurality (42 percent) just wasn’t sure. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2022/10/05/58f11/2">Additional data from YouGov</a> found that a minority of Americans (36 percent) said they’ve ever seen a realistic, AI-generated image of a person, while <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2022/10/05/58f11/3">a vast majority</a> hadn’t used AI-driven image-generating websites themselves: Seventy-three percent of Americans had never done so, including 58 percent ages 18 to 29 and 57 percent between ages 30 and 44. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, The Daily Beast reported that Herschel Walker, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Georgia who has campaigned on being anti-abortion, paid for his then-girlfriend’s abortion in 2009. Walker has denied the allegation. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses how the scandals surrounding Walker have evolved over the course of his Senate campaign and how this could affect the outcome of the race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They break down how candidate misconduct is generally factored into the FiveThirtyEight model and if this newest allegation will even be considered a scandal by the model’s standards.</p>
