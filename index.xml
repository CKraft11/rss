<p data-paragraph="main">When Virginia state Sen. Jennifer McClellan is sworn into the House of Representatives <a href="https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a878c18b95cb7701f2773f193c296a4a19fd2f5784a9bc34e0ce61a9d17b9d8c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this evening</a>, Congress’s lower chamber will be something it hasn’t been in a long time: full.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The last time the U.S. had a full House — with all 435 of its voting representatives seated — was nearly three and a half years ago. And even then, it wasn’t full for long. When Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/D000614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned on</a> Sept. 23, 2019, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/26/sean-duffy-says-hes-leaving-congress-september/2120442001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to care for his newborn baby</a> with a heart defect, he left a House that had had 435 members for all of six days. In the 1,261 days since, there’s been at least one empty seat in the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="The House will be full for the first time since 2019" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/D2Pff/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="538" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though this has been an unusually long run in modern times, the timing and number of vacancies generally come down to chance. Members <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-people-are-resigning-from-congress-than-at-any-time-in-recent-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometimes resign and leave office</a> before their terms expire, whether for another work opportunity (inside government or outside) or because of a scandal. Less predictable circumstances, like a member’s health problems or even death, also affect whether the House is at capacity. The current Congress (the 118th) began with one seat empty because Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin won reelection in November 2022 but died <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/tonight-he-lost-that-battle-congressman-donald-mceachin-dies-at-61/article_a43716c5-1c6b-53db-a601-17fb27c6f8fc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later that month</a>; McClellan was elected on Feb. 21 to fill his old seat. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And when vacancies happen to overlap, it can produce periods like the current run of musical chairs. Duffy’s resignation came less than a week after the House got back to full strength for the first time since January 2017 (about two and a half years). Wisconsin’s governor scheduled a special election for May 2020 to fill Duffy’s seat, but <a href="https://www.wpr.org/tiffany-wins-northwoods-special-election-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by the time of that contest</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/nyregion/rep-chris-collins-ny-insider-trading.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five other</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/27/rep-katie-hill-to-resign-amid-allegations-of-inappropriate-relationships-with-staffers-000301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seats had</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/07/rep-duncan-hunter-resigns-from-congress-095725" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become vacant</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/rep-mark-meadows-resigns-congress-take-chief-staff-role-n1172621" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to resignations</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/17/elijah-cummings-dies-baltimore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or deaths</a>.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four of those five vacancies didn’t have special elections before the Wisconsin one. But in Maryland’s 7th District, Rep. Elijah Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019, and Rep. Kweisi Mfume won a April 28, 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/elections/bs-md-pol-7th-congressional-district-election-20200428-bo7fnkygqbhwtnbiqgz52xmu2e-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;special election to succeed&lt;/a&gt; Cummings — two weeks before the special election for Duffy’s old seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> And while the 2020 general election held elections for 435 seats, two were left vacant at the start of the 117th Congress due to <a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/congressman-luke-letlow-moved-to-icu-for-covid-19-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the death of</a> Louisiana Rep.-elect Luke Letlow in December 2020 and an extremely close election in New York’s 22nd District <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2021/02/rep-claudia-tenney-sworn-into-office-to-represent-ny-22-in-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that delayed the seating</a> of Rep. Claudia Tenney. In the spring of 2021, appointments to President Biden’s administration opened up seats in <a href="https://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/2021/01/20/louisiana-political-heavyweights-seek-replace-congressman-cedric-richmond-march-20-election/4221132001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/15/977558590/deb-haaland-confirmed-as-first-native-american-interior-secretary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Mexico</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/politics/marcia-fudge-confirmed-hud-secretary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a>, and a host of other resignations and deaths occurred — <a href="https://www.wral.com/butterfield-leaving-congress-a-few-days-early-for-dc-law-firm/20649319/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even in the</a> last few <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/volume-168/issue-204/house-section/article/H10549-6?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22resignation+AND+%5C%22mike+doyle%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;s=2&amp;r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">days of the</a> outgoing Congress in December 2022.</p>


<div></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">But one trend that isn’t necessarily down to chance may also be contributing to lengthier vacancies, which reduces the likelihood of having all 435 seats filled. States <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-some-house-districts-wont-have-a-representative-for-almost-a-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been taking longer</a> to hold special elections for vacancies than in the past — both because elections now need more lead time because of laws regarding overseas balloting and expanded mail voting, but also because of governors’ political maneuvering to delay filling a seat likely to go to the opposition party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before we get too comfortable, however, this full House is going to turn into a weaker poker hand pretty soon. That’s because Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/21/rep-david-cicilline-resigning-house-seat-congress-will-lead-rhode-island-foundation/69926910007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced on Feb. 21</a> that he would resign effective June 1 to become CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation. It’s unclear when Rhode Island <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/r-special-election-date-will-wait-cicilline-vacates-seat-rcna71611" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will hold a special election for Cicilline’s seat</a>, but it might not be until later this year. If that’s the case, that would leave plenty of time for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-arent-the-only-ones-who-really-dislike-george-santos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other members to resign</a> — or for something unexpected to occur. One way or the other, though, it seems like our full House won’t last very long.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The Department of Energy says COVID-19 was caused by a lab leak. But that doesn’t mean COVID-19 was definitely caused by a lab leak. In fact, the agency’s report, which made headlines last week, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/28/1160157977/u-s-dept-of-energy-says-with-low-confidence-that-covid-may-have-leaked-from-a-la" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states it has “low confidence” in its own conclusion</a>. Scientific evidence, on the other hand, has <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly pointed</a> toward <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/02/28/1160162845/what-does-the-science-say-about-the-origin-of-the-sars-cov-2-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a natural spillover from animals to humans</a> — the same origin of <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/04/how-dangerous-viruses-could-escape-from-laboratories.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly every other outbreak</a> in history and <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/07/1122522" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a growing threat</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What this DOE report <em>does</em> prove is that COVID-19’s origins have become extremely politicized. With congressional hearings, a federal advisory board and government reports pitting the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community against the conclusions of scientists, it raises the question – if a lab leak were the true origin of COVID-19, would it change how we prepare for pandemics? Clearly, a sizable portion of the American political system is engaged with the idea that proving COVID-19 began with a lab leak matters. But <em>why</em> does it matter? Is it motivated by the political goal of assigning blame or the public health goal of planning for the future? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not, after all, the first time scientists have thought about lab safety. Or the first time anyone has talked about, or implemented, biosecurity regulations. We spoke to Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and one of the scientists investigating COVID-19’s origins, to understand how scientists were thinking about lab safety before the pandemic politicized it — and what needs to happen to protect the world from pandemics, wherever they might come from. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: Whether COVID-19 came from a lab leak or if it was a zoonotic spillover, does that change what we have to do to prepare for or mitigate the risk of future pandemics?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Angela Rasmussen:<strong> </strong>Yes, it matters. But also, no, it doesn’t. So we already know that lab accidents are potentially dangerous. We also already know that they’ve happened before. But as far as I know, there’s been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4542197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one lab-associated pandemic</a>, and that was a flu pandemic in 1977, that started … likely as a result of a vaccine trial. Lab-acquired infections are a known risk. We also know how to mitigate that risk pretty well. That doesn’t mean we eliminate the risk. But it does mean we can mitigate it significantly, and of course we should. No matter what, we’re not going to be like, “Oh, it was zoonotic. So let’s not worry about biosafety biosecurity anymore.” Nobody at all is ever going to say that because we were already worried about biosafety and biosecurity. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/biden-vulnerable-primary-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-97670358</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But I do think that the reason why it matters where the pandemic came from is that if people are saying that it’s a lab leak, one of the consequences of this is that people are going to say, “It was that person’s fault, get them out of here, hold them accountable, whatever. And maybe shut down a lab. But don’t worry about zoonosis.” When in reality, we should not neglect lab safety. And we should certainly hold people accountable. But we also shouldn’t be taking resources away from the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00187-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threat of zoonosis</a> because it’s <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/spillover-diseases-are-emerging-faster-than-ever-beforethanks-to-humans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a much, much bigger threat</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>MK: Biosafety and biosecurity, and regulation around those things, aren’t new ideas. What was the discussion around lab safety like in the years leading up to COVID, before it was politicized?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">AR<strong>: </strong>If you really want to go all the way back to the beginning, that was in response partly to the anthrax attacks after 9/11. I think that was a wake-up call to the government that people could conduct bioterrorism with few resources. What came out of that was the Select Agents and Toxins Act, which basically made it a federal crime to mishandle a list of pathogens that are considered to be exceptionally dangerous or candidates for development into bio weapons. This differs from country to country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then in 2010, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/213/9/1364/2459266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two experiments were done</a>; one by Yoshihiro Kawaoka and one by Ron Fouchier. They basically selected variants of H5N1 [influenza virus] that were transmissible amongst ferrets by the airborne route. And that got a lot of people’s attention because H5N1 doesn’t transmit very efficiently between people by the airborne route. It really doesn’t transmit efficiently between people at all. The fear of so-called gain of function experiments began with those data, and there was a whole big discussion about, you know, should they publish their findings? Should they publish their methods? They did end up publishing both. But then there was a moratorium that was imposed on all research on influenza and coronaviruses that would potentially be considered gain of function. [That led to] the Pandemic Potential Pathogen Care and Oversight Framework, and that is how, currently, the [National Institutes of Health] or the Department of Health and Human Services regulates [biosafety].</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>MK: You’re talking here about two different things that both sort of get lumped together under the word “biosafety”: Regulation of lab security and practice and regulation of types of experiments that could be dangerous. Should we be talking about those separately? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">AR: Boy, on this topic I’m seeing everything getting mixed up. I think some of it reflects the fact that some people, because of the lab leak theory, which can be a very compelling story, have just decided, “This seems like a pretty dangerous thing. I guess I better jump into this field now.” And I think there’s a lot of people who are essentially newcomers to it, who don’t necessarily have a lot of technical knowledge. So I do think that these efforts are being sort of wrongly conflated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>MK: What are your thoughts on the recommendations made by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, which earlier this year </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/science/biosecurity-virus-pathogens-covid-lab-leak.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>issued a report</strong></a><strong> that was particularly centered on new proposed regulations for gain of function research?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">AR: They basically said that now we need to start regulating everything that deals with a pathogen. Their new recommendations were maddening because they were both so vague, but also so potentially broad in scope, that it could mean essentially a stoppage of any research that involves a virus, even if it’s a virus that doesn’t make anything or anybody sick.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/poll-ended-dilbert-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-97670065</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">It has kind of turned into this creep, where a lot of people who don’t actually do any of this work and don’t have a very good technical understanding of it can come in and say, “Oh, look at this, this experiment could cause a zombie apocalypse, or this could cause the extinction of the human race with transmissible bird flu.” And none of these things are really very accurate or likely. But a lot of that sort of fear-based messaging is, I think, really motivating. It really is a big problem. And many of my colleagues and I have been talking about this. If we can’t do a lot of the work that we do, [the result is] no more vaccines, no more antiviral therapies, no more understanding zoonotic pathogens that are going to emerge.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>MK: I think it’s easy to see this, though, as an industry — in this case, virology — pushing back against regulation, just because that’s what industries do. Are there regulations you would support? Things you’d like to see changed? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">AR: I do think that making the [Pandemic Potential Pathogen Care and Oversight Framework] more broadly applicable to multiple agencies across the U.S. government, and making it smarter [would be good]. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We already have a lot of regulation. And we’re happy to comply with more, if that makes sense. But right now, I haven’t seen any proposals that actually make sense or that would meaningfully address actual threats that we do work with. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>MK: If there were a lab leak situation that led to a pandemic, what kinds of changes would you expect to see? What would you like to see people who believe COVID-19 was a lab leak pushing for?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">AR: The one thing that we should all be pushing for, and one thing that has kind of gotten lost in this conversation, is that every country regulates biosafety differently and biosecurity differently. Even between Canada and the U.S., for example, things are regulated differently. And this is kind of a big problem when it comes to responding to “lab leaks” or trying to think about this as an international effort. There is no sort of treaty mechanism that would allow an organization like [the World Health Organization] to put together a multinational working group that would have any enforcement power. There is discussion about a pandemic treaty at the World Health Assembly. So I think that really a lot of the focus should go toward that, because that’s going to address international collaborative efforts to get to the bottom of any sort of new emerging pathogen, whether it’s from a lab or whether it’s from nature. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>MK: I’m curious if there’s anything valuable that COVID-19 and the arguments over where it came from have taught you about those cultural differences within science, and how science is done in different parts of the world. </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">AR: Yeah, it has been really instructive. I know people who are scientists, either from China or in China. What I’ve learned about the situation in China is that there are very, very different political pressures that scientists are working under. I’m familiar with the U.S. and the Canadian system. There’s always some politics involved. [But] there’s a whole different set of considerations that I think scientists in China have to deal with. There’s also a whole different reward system. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the arguments that, to me, is crazy is [that] the Wuhan Institute of Virology developed the secret reverse genetics clone of the SARS2 precursor and didn’t publish it, because [virologist] <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/09/1044985/shi-zhengli-covid-lab-leak-wuhan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shi Zhengli</a> was afraid that she’d get blamed for starting the pandemic that hadn’t started yet. That makes zero sense to me because I found that in many Chinese institutions, people get significant cash bonuses when they write a Nature, Science or Cell paper. If you’re the senior author of these high profile papers, you get compensated for it quite a lot, actually thousands of dollars.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ve also noticed that a lot of times when people are talking about especially safety practices, there’s an assumption that things are inferior in China. That’s not the case at all. These so-called safety problems that were occurring at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, BSL-4 lab, were actually not safety problems. They were, to me, indicative of a biosafety maximum containment lab, where they were doing what they normally do for containment lab, which is constantly reevaluating how you might be able to do things better and installing multiple redundant systems so that you don’t have the containment breach.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>MK: So you’re actually coming away from this a little bit more confident in international standards?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">AR: I wouldn’t say I’m more confident in international standards because there aren’t any. I’m more confident, though, that in some ways, while China is different, and there’s clearly different pressures that scientists in China have to work under, it’s kind of like the institutions in any other country I’ve worked in. I’ve never seen anything that indicates to me that there’s a culture of lax regulation of high containment labs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Add to that, individual labs will have individual challenges. The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease has had these terrible plumbing problems where their containment labs are getting flooded. There’s all these problems. So it’s not like just China that would have potential safety issues, or literally physical problems, engineering failures with their containment labs. That can happen anywhere. I think the difference is how proactive your institution is about trying to prevent those from happening in the first place. But it looks to me like WIV is constantly working to improve its biosafety and biocontainment practices.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-evolution-of-affirmative-action-cases-from-bakke-to-fisher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">origins of the affirmative action debate</a> arguably revolved around a racial binary of white and Black students. But the face of victimhood has now changed. In a case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.lawyerscommittee.org/students-for-fair-admissions-sffa-v-harvard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting Harvard University</a>, a group founded by a white conservative tactician is arguing that the use of race-conscious admissions allows the elite university <a href="https://www.vox.com/22301135/supreme-court-affirmative-action-harvard-college-race-students-for-fair-admission-ed-blum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to discriminate against</a><em> Asian Americans</em>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This new strategy might resonate with the high court’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-conservative-supermajority-is-just-beginning-to-flex-its-muscles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative majority</a>, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2022/11/01/justices-appear-skeptical-affirmative-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is already skeptical</a> of the use of race-based remedies to correct historic injustices, and it’s not hard to see why — who wouldn’t be alarmed if race-conscious admissions are hurting the very students they’re <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/magazine/where-does-affirmative-action-leave-asian-americans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to help</a>? But if the justices rule in the plaintiffs’ favor later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/us/supreme-court-harvard-unc-affirmative-action.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this spring or summer</a>, it might not be because there’s overwhelming evidence that the end of affirmative action would be good for Asian Americans — or even that Asian Americans, as a whole, want race-conscious admissions to end. In reality, the plaintiffs’ success this go-around could hinge on whether this new argument can conjure up more judicial sympathy than white students were able to. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The plaintiffs’ logic <a href="https://www.aera.net/Newsroom/New-Research-Contradicts-Claims-that-Asian-American-Students-Are-Harmed-When-They-Cannot-Attend-Their-First-Choice-University" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has long been</a> <a href="https://www.aera.net/Newsroom/Asian-Americans-Admissions-College-Choice-An-Empirical-Test-of-Claims-of-Harm-Used-in-Federal-Investigations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a topic of debate</a> and implicitly draws on a longstanding set of stereotypes about Asian Americans, but that’s a feature, not a bug, of their argument. They’re hoping this year’s case will result in a college admissions process in which there would be no race or ethnicity boxes to check. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Race has always been a charged issue in America, as this country was built on a foundation with white people on top,” said <a href="https://lawschool.unm.edu/faculty/harpalani/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinay Harpalani</a>, a law professor at the University of New Mexico. “Anything that challenges that hierarchy makes many white people uncomfortable — and that is what affirmative action does.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/biden-vulnerable-primary-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-97670358</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The plaintiffs contend that Harvard’s approach to race-conscious admissions holds Asian Americans to a higher standard when it comes to objective metrics like test scores, and penalizes them on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subjective measures</a> like “positive personality,” likability and kindness. (The Supreme Court is also <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/students-for-fair-admissions-inc-v-university-of-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering a separate</a> but linked case against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that draws on more traditional arguments against affirmative action.) But critiques of this nature have been percolating at the Supreme Court for a while now: Back in 2016, Justice Samuel Alito <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alito-dissent-fisher-v-texas-2016-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized the University of Texas at Austin</a> for allegedly discriminating against Asian Americans, dissenting from a majority opinion that largely upheld the university’s race-conscious admissions policy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This term’s case, however, is largely the product <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/affirmative-action/meet-edward-blum-man-who-wants-kill-affirmative-action-higher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of an alliance</a> between white conservative legal strategist, Edward Blum, and a comparatively amateur base of Asian American activists. Blum, <a href="https://thegrio.com/2022/11/01/meet-edward-blum-the-man-who-wants-to-take-down-affirmative-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has long been fighting</a> against <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/edward-blum-supreme-court-affirmative-action-civil-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race-based remedies</a> to historical injustice, is the head of the organization that is suing Harvard. Somewhat ironically, though, their argument that Asian Americans are harmed by affirmative action actually draws on a longstanding set of stereotypes about them. As a group, they sit at an interesting intersection because, while they face <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/21/one-third-of-asian-americans-fear-threats-physical-attacks-and-most-say-violence-against-them-is-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violence and discrimination</a> in the same ways that other marginalized groups do, they’ve also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2012/06/19/the-rise-of-asian-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed other racial and ethnic groups</a> (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-americans-set-surpass-whites-median-family-wealth-n314341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including white Americans</a>) across other metrics of success. And treating affirmative action as a practice that either hurts or helps an entire racial group doesn’t acknowledge the sprawling diversity contained within the Asian American community. In fact, many of <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/affirmative-action/meet-edward-blum-man-who-wants-kill-affirmative-action-higher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blum’s critics</a> have even pointed to a video in which he admitted after losing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/us/politics/supreme-court-affirmative-action-university-of-texas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UT Austin affirmative action case</a> that he “needed” Asian plaintiffs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It was a very explicit strategy that Blum had to try and change the narrative on affirmative action by putting Asian Americans front and center,” <a href="https://natashawarikoo.com/is-affirmative-action-fair-the-myth-of-equity-in-college-admissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha Warikoo</a>, a sociology professor at Tufts University and author of “<a href="https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=is-affirmative-action-fair-the-myth-of-equity-in-college-admissions--9781509549368" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is Affirmative Action Fair?: The Myth of Equity in College Admissions</a>,” told me. “And he found Asian Americans who were willing to play that role and bought his argument.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, this isn’t the first time that some Asian Americans have decried affirmative action’s effect on their ability to attend certain elite universities. In 2014, an Asian American student who had near-perfect test scores and a 4.67 weighted GPA was rejected from a number of Ivy League colleges and <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/07/16/asian-americans-and-sca-5-heres-why-many-oppose-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a subsequent op-ed</a> addressing his experience <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/05/26/how-asian-americans-became-the-center-of-the-affirmative-action-debate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that went viral</a>. Around the same time — and after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/us/politics/supreme-court-affirmative-action-university-of-texas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing the high-profile affirmative action case</a> at UT Austin — conservatives like Blum seemingly lasered in on Asian Americans who opposed affirmative action and found allies in people like Yukong Zhao, the president of Asian American Coalition for Education. (The father of the student who wrote the op-ed cofounded this organization.) During a phone call with me, Zhao said that his son was a victim of discrimination because despite his “stellar academic and extracurricular credentials,” he was not accepted “by any of America’s top 20 universities,” including Princeton University, Cornell University and Johns Hopkins University.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It wasn’t his son’s situation that caused Zhao to enter this debate, however. In fact, he cited his earlier participation in the fight against <a href="https://archive.kpcc.org/blogs/multiamerican/2014/03/21/16152/sca-5-chinese-americans-immigrants-asian-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2014 proposed constitutional amendment in California</a> that would’ve asked voters whether they wanted to roll back the state’s ban on racial preferences in public college admissions as a primary reason for getting involved. Then, in 2015, his own group, alongside other Asian American organizations Zhao said he helped recruit, filed a <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/5/16/complaint-federal-harvard-admissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate civil rights complaint against Harvard</a> — which the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-07/harvard-bias-complaint-dismissed-by-education-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Education dismissed</a> — for discriminating against Asian American applicants.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice began &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/21/politics/harvard-affirmative-action-justice-department/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;investigating the allegations&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> Zhao said now, though, Blum’s connections and influence might go further with the media — and perhaps even the courts. Pointing to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Price-Admission-Americas-Colleges-Outside/dp/1400097975" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of</a> <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9072.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a>, he concluded that Asian Americans are punished for receiving higher test scores relative to other students of color. “It feels like the top schools aren’t trying to attract Asian students,” he said. “Asian Americans are punished for their hard working and outstanding credentials both in academics and in extracurricular activities.” </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/poll-ended-dilbert-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-97670065</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Zhao also echoed the traditional language of civil rights activists, saying that discrimination against Asian Americans gets ignored. “If a Black man or a teenager is harmed by the police, many Black organizations, like the NAACP, and politicians will stand up for them. But in Asian American communities generally … our children all fight civil rights issues alone,” he said. The hope, then, among Blum, Zhao and others is for a college-admissions process in which race is no longer a consideration. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But not all Asian Americans <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-10-25/affirmative-action-supreme-court-asian-american" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agree with this approach</a> or <a href="http://reappropriate.co/2017/08/asian-americans-and-pacific-islander-aapi-writing-in-support-of-affirmative-action-notyourwedge-aapiforaffaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desire this outcome</a>. A 2019 survey by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/25/most-americans-say-colleges-should-not-consider-race-or-ethnicity-in-admissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a> found that while most Asian American adults (58 percent) <em>do not</em> believe colleges should consider race or ethnicity as a factor in admissions decisions, the share who oppose this was decidedly lower than American adults overall (73 percent). But polling on this topic isn’t cut and dry. The <a href="https://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AAVS-Tables.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Asian American Voter Survey</a>, for instance, found that beliefs varied widely among Asian American subgroups — but there was largely broad support. Fifty-nine percent of Chinese Americans said they <em>favor</em> affirmative action programs in higher education designed to help Black people, women and other minorities, compared with overwhelming majorities of Indian (80 percent), Korean (82 percent), Vietnamese (67 percent) and Filipino Americans (67 percent) who said the same.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while anti-Asian Americans bias <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/opinion/affirmative-action-asian-american-bias.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certainly exists in higher education</a> — and American society as a whole — it’s also not clear that affirmative action is responsible. By and large, studies suggest that Asian Americans <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/selectivebias/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have benefited from affirmative action</a> as much as other groups. So not only is there <a href="http://reappropriate.co/2015/05/espenshade-data-are-not-proof-of-anti-asian-discrimination-edu4all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little empirical evidence</a> backing the claim that affirmative action is the sole culprit hampering Asian Americans students’ enrollment numbers at certain elite universities (even the coauthor of the one of the studies Zhao pointed to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2017/08/07/look-data-and-arguments-about-asian-americans-and-admissions-elite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said this wasn’t true</a>, pointing out that he lacked insight into a host of other factors that could explain observable differences), but in places where these affirmative action is already banned, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as California</a>, <a href="https://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/affirmative-action-mismatch-and-economic-mobility-after-california%E2%80%99s-proposition-209" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data suggests</a> that ending racial preferences in the state university system didn’t notably boost enrollment numbers among Asian American students. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, Black and Hispanic enrollment at these institutions <a href="https://www.vox.com/22301135/supreme-court-affirmative-action-harvard-college-race-students-for-fair-admission-ed-blum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would likely suffer the most</a> if affirmative action was deemed unconstitutional. Our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-happens-when-you-ban-affirmative-action-in-college-admissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past reporting</a> on the topic suggests that in states with existing bans on affirmative action, Black students were underrepresented by at least 20 percent at 79 percent of public research universities and only two research universities in states with affirmative action bans had at least the same proportion of Black students as the state’s college-age population; Hispanic students, meanwhile, were underrepresented by at least 20 percent at 82 percent of the public research universities. Only one school had at least the same proportion of Hispanic students as the state’s college-aged student population.</p>

</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some Asian American students might be penalized, too. “Going to an admissions policy that is hyper-focused on GPA and standardized test scores is going to have a significantly detrimental effect on Asian Americans and Asian American groups that tend to be lower performers on those metrics due to a variety of social and historical reasons,” said <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/jonathan-feingold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Feingold</a>, a professor of law at Boston University. Indeed, one of the issues that experts have pointed out with the current case is that it doesn’t capture the full complexity of the Asian American community. That’s a leading reason behind why researchers often advocate for breaking down larger categories, like Asian American, into smaller blocs. For example, not all Asian American students are academic overachievers with high test scores — there are poorer, more underserved populations who remain underrepresented in higher education and could benefit from affirmative action. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Affirmative action proponents, <a href="https://www.advancingjustice-aajc.org/news/affirmative-action-benefits-everyone-including-asian-americans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including some Asian Americans</a>, have also argued that everyone — regardless of race — stands to suffer if affirmative action is wiped out across the board. “Without it, students might miss out on a more diverse learning environment since they won’t be exposed to as many perspectives and voices in the classroom,” Warikoo said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the plaintiffs’ claims <a href="https://www.hrpolicy.org/insight-and-research/resources/2022/hr-workforce/public/11/five-takeaways-from-the-scotus-oral-arguments-on-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed to resonate</a> with the justices <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2022/20-1199_6537.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the oral arguments</a> last fall — particularly the idea that Asian Americans are facing the same kind of overt discrimination that Harvard inflicted <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/11/harvard-jewish-quotas-asian-americans-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on academically talented Jewish applicants a century ago</a>. This is a clear riff on the “<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-model-minority-myth-6259907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model minority</a>” trope, which essentially argues that Asian Americans’ hard work, personal responsibility and success offer proof that American meritocracy works as it’s intended. But the notion of “model minorities” comes with a flip side — “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problem minorities</a>.” And as it pertains to higher education, these arguments can implicitly serve as <a href="https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1828&amp;context=faculty_scholarship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a counterpoint to negative stereotypes</a> about Black, Hispanic and Native Americans — which, in turn, help justify their underrepresentation. “The social category, Asian Americans, if invoked in a crude ‘model minority’ sense, is used quite strategically to undercut the claim that racial discrimination is a causal barrier that’s preventing Black or Hispanic students from being able to enter these institutions,” Feingold told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Focusing on Asian Americans has another benefit for opponents of affirmative action: White students are almost completely taken out of the conversation. In this line of argument, Asian Americans are penalized so that other students of color benefit instead. It’s compelling in its simplicity: “College admissions is a zero-sum game. So when you give advantages to one group, people who do not have that characteristic lose seats,” said Duke University economics professor <a href="http://public.econ.duke.edu/~psarcidi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Arcidiacono</a>, who was an expert witness in both the Harvard and UNC cases. “There are a lot of seats that are for affirmative action, which naturally helps crowd out other applicants. And that’s particularly true for Asian Americans because they disproportionately perform extremely well in school, so they ended up being fairly competitive for those top spots.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in this framing, white students are rendered third-party bystanders to race-conscious admissions policies which could, in turn, help bolster a belief <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already held</a> by many white conservatives that they’re “victims” of an unjust system that artificially awards extra “points” to certain communities of color while taking away those same “points” from them. And focusing on affirmative action ignores the many practices of systemic favoritism in place — <a href="https://slate.com/business/2019/09/harvard-admissions-affirmative-action-white-students-legacy-athletes-donors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like legacy admissions</a> and athlete recruitment — that disproportionately help white students. Eliminating those would likely boost the enrollment numbers of students of color, according to <a href="http://public.econ.duke.edu/~psarcidi/legacyathlete.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arcidiacono’s research</a> and estimations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="What would boost enrollment of students of color at Harvard?" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QkHLm/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="396" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, evidence from Harvard suggests legacy admissions and athlete recruitment disproportionately help boost white students’ enrollment numbers there. A <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/study-harvard-finds-43-percent-white-students-are-legacy-athletes-n1060361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 study looking at Harvard admissions data</a>, for instance, found that almost half (43 percent) of white students were recruited athletes, legacy students, had parents who donated to the school or children of faculty and staff — there’s no law in place for plaintiffs to challenge to get rid of this, too. Zhao acknowledged this wrinkle and told me he’s against legacy admissions; Arcidiacono, meanwhile, predicted that legacy admissions might be the next topic of scrutiny should affirmative action get overturned, but there’s no easy legal avenue its critics could take to ban it completely. “It all comes down to what you can sue over,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the effort to overturn affirmative action is successful, though, the effect will be felt far beyond Harvard. Professors and college administrators <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/02/24/affirmative-action-scotus-college-diversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have argued it will</a> force universities to find completely new methods for ensuring diverse student bodies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we don’t know how they’ll rule, but given the Supreme Court’s conservative bent and Republicans’ crusade du jour against advancing issues of racial justice, it seems like a fairly good bet that affirmative action will be all but dead after this year. While a highly conservative court certainly helps that cause, I’d argue that — if affirmative action <em>is </em>doomed — its demise is due to the fact that the stories we tell about it have changed: Asian Americans have become the centerpoint, and white students are no longer the focus. It’s a politically savvy story to tell, and it may well be the final boost conservatives need to end affirmative action after decades of trying. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Author Marianne Williamson officially entered the 2024 Democratic presidential primary on Saturday. President Biden has yet to announce his reelection campaign, but every indication is that he plans to do so. It’s very unlikely that Williamson will be a serious challenger to Biden, but with multiple polls suggesting that a majority of Democrats don’t want Biden to run for reelection, the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast crew asks if he might be vulnerable against the <em>right</em> challenger?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also take a look at the results of recent elections in Chicago, Wisconsin and Virginia to see if they hold any lessons about the national political environment. And they ask whether the poll that Dilbert creator Scott Adams went on a racist rant over was actually a meaningful poll.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The picture remains fuzzy, but the 2024 presidential candidate field is starting to come into focus. As the nomination contests develop over the coming months, FiveThirtyEight will naturally be keeping tabs on presidential primary and general election polls, but we are also interested in the broader public’s opinion of the contenders. We’ll monitor <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s job approval rating</a>, but for presidential aspirants who don’t yet hold that office, we’ll watch polls asking whether respondents have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of them — or don’t have an opinion at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In light of this, we’re now tracking the favorability ratings of major candidates on <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polls page</a>! We’ve been monitoring <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump’s favorability rating</a> since 2021, but we’ve now added polling for three other declared or would-be GOP contenders: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence. Moving forward, we’ll add more candidates from both parties, as long as they meet FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-how-were-defining-a-major-presidential-candidate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of a major candidate</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/nikki-haley-trumps-1st-major-challenger-gop-presidential-97201580</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">One note of caution: These figures show favorability ratings among the public as a whole,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polls have varying sample populations (usually adults, registered voters or likely voters). In cases where a poll has data for multiple sample populations, we use the broadest one (e.g., adults over registered voters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> so they don’t tell us how <em>primary</em> voters view these candidates. If primary voters like a candidate who isn’t that well-known, that candidate might have room to grow support in election polling. At the same time, a candidate could end up shifting opinions because of the positions they take and the rhetoric they use, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/15/trumps-popularity-spikes-among-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much like Trump did</a> during the 2016 cycle. That, in turn, could influence how the public as a whole views them, affecting the averages we’ve presented here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With those caveats, let’s take a look at how Americans perceive four of Biden’s potential GOP opponents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ll <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start with Trump</a>, who declared his candidacy <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-2024-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in November</a>. A <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeply polarizing figure</a>, Trump has consistently had a higher unfavorable rating than a favorable one since he left office in January 2021. Currently, about 43 percent of Americans view him favorably, and 52 percent view him unfavorably. As a result, Trump’s net favorability (favorable percentage minus unfavorable percentage) stands at about -9 percentage points. It’s no wonder, then, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/will-gop-elites-rally-around-a-trump-alternative-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that many</a> Republican leaders <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/02/09/gop-trump-2024-election-00081944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry about him</a> winning the GOP’s nomination and having to face the broader November electorate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2014" height="1078" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.47.41-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.47.41-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.47.41-PM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.47.41-PM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Haley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nikki-haley-is-taking-on-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also officially running</a>, and the good news for her is that she’s far less divisive than Trump. About 38 percent view Haley favorably versus 31 percent who view her unfavorably, which gives her a +7 net favorability rating. Of course, that also means Haley is not nearly as well-known as Trump, but that could be a good thing: She has the opportunity to gain in favorability as people learn more about her (although partisanship will impede most Democrats from holding a positive opinion of her).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2008" height="1092" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.46.48-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.46.48-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.46.48-PM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.46.48-PM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, Trump leads <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most early primary polling</a>, but DeSantis is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/desantis-is-polling-well-against-trump-as-long-as-no-one-else-runs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently in the best position</a> to challenge the former president for the GOP nomination. Even though DeSantis has not yet entered the race, he is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ron-desantis-politics-south-carolina-state-government-new-hampshire-iowa-38f205a00052b1f0b16572d663383cb1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely expected to</a>. About 44 percent have a favorable view of DeSantis, and 36 percent have an unfavorable view. That means more people are familiar with him than Haley, but despite that, his net favorability rating of +8 is better. If you’re DeSantis’s nascent campaign operation, that figure could be evidence for potential donors and supporters that the Florida governor is in a better position to win a general election than the more unpopular Trump.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1990" height="1058" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.45.37-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.45.37-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.45.37-PM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.45.37-PM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, Pence is the other big name who hasn’t yet declared. Like Trump, Pence has mediocre favorability numbers. Overall, about 34 percent have a favorable view of Pence, while about 48 percent have an unfavorable impression of him. Some of Pence’s poor standing is undoubtedly due to his link to Trump, which has probably predisposed Democrats (and many independents) to hold unfavorable views of him. But Pence also doesn’t have especially great numbers among Republicans, which <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/favorable_mike_pence?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been the case</a> since he refused to aid Trump’s attempts to undermine the 2020 election.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1934" height="1052" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.45.02-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.45.02-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.45.02-PM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-4.45.02-PM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">The numbers we’ve run through give an overview of how the public views these major Republican presidential contenders. They could influence voters and party bigwigs as to who is more electable in a general election, and they can tell us how well-known a candidate is. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">During oral arguments this week, the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/02/28/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cast a skeptical eye</a> on President Biden’s plan to forgive — or at least reduce — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/student-loan-forgiveness-biden-plan-d9c8e18774a744187c9af634bf4eb728" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 40 million people’s</a> student debt, likely imperiling one of the Democrat’s signature policy initiatives. Among the sticking points for the conservative judges, so far, is that Biden lacks the congressional authority needed to provide over $400 billion in student loan forgiveness — a move justified <a href="https://apnews.com/article/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-hearing-2128da75fc27ff3bcc0c3804ebd98aa7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. “We take very seriously the idea of separation of powers and that power should be divided to prevent its abuse,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-28/full-text-student-loan-forgiveness-arguments-at-supreme-court-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Chief Justice John Roberts. “This is a case that presents extraordinarily serious, important issues about the role of Congress and about the role that we should exercise in scrutinizing that.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s student debt plan has plenty of defenders outside the Supreme Court, though. In the lead-up <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/27/supreme-court-readies-to-hear-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Tuesday’s hearing</a>, a bevy of interest groups and borrowers who would be affected by the decision <a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/news/op-ed-the-breathing-room-america-needs-is-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-33657200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penned op-eds</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/28/us-student-loan-debt-us-supreme-court-hears-arguments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to the streets</a> in an attempt to plead with the court against overturning Biden’s decree. And polls, too, suggest that the public is broadly in favor of student debt-relief programs — at least to some extent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to a February <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/02/Fox_February-19-22-2023_Complete_National_Topline_February-26-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beacon Research/Shaw &amp; Company Research for Fox News</a> poll, conducted just before the oral arguments took place, a majority of respondents (62 percent) said that at least some<em> </em>student debt should be forgiven — though they didn’t agree on just how much forgiveness was appropriate. Of that total number, 25 percent said that <em>all</em> college loan debt should be forgiven, while a larger percentage (37 percent) said that only amounts of up to $20,000 — <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is double the amount</a> of Biden’s plan for most borrowers — should be forgiven for people making up to $125,000 annually. Thirty-six percent of respondents, meanwhile, said no loan debt amount should be forgiven. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/biden-vulnerable-primary-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-97670358</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Other polls have similarly shown broad support for Biden’s plan. A <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/lt3qbl33wm/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Economist</a> survey conducted from Feb. 20-21 found that 53 percent of U.S. adults either “strongly” or “somewhat” supported the federal government canceling up to $10,000 in student loans for people who earn less than $125,000 a year. In the same poll, 44 percent of respondents said that the federal government has at least some responsibility to address student loan debt, while 40 percent said that it doesn’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It does look like Biden found a sweet spot in terms of just how much debt to forgive. Most polls I looked at for this story found support for the $10,000 forgiveness he’s proposing for non-Pell Grant recipients, although it wasn’t overwhelming. In that February YouGov/Economist survey, about half (51 percent) of respondents said that amount of debt forgiveness was “too little” (28 percent) or “about right” (23 percent), while one-third (32 percent) of respondents said that $10,000 was “too much.” That roughly 50 percent threshold has held steady over the past few months, too. Back in August, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/us/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden first announced</a> the initiative, two polls — one from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us08312022_ufcg18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a> and the other from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/kqp1ntoj7v/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a> — put support among registered voters for it at 51 percent and 52 percent, respectively. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That support for Biden’s proposal makes sense considering the myriad benefits of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2022/01/24/a-regressive-student-loan-system-results-in-costly-racial-disparities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceling student debt</a>. To be sure, there are some well-documented fears among Americans that slashing student debt <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/22/americans-are-concerned-student-loan-forgiveness-will-worsen-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would worsen inflation</a> and/or that it doesn’t address <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/09/why-is-college-so-expensive-in-america/569884/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just how expensive</a> colleges have become. Still, some estimates predict that relieving student debt could <a href="https://educationdata.org/what-happens-if-student-loan-debt-is-canceled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add up to 1.5 million jobs</a> to the market and lift over 5 million Americans out of poverty — in addition to freeing many Americans of the debt trap that appears to be contributing to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-says-student-debt-is-u-s-hurting-housing-market-11547657473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lagging housing market</a> and widening <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/why-biden-should-forgive-student-loan-debt/617171/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial wealth gap</a>. Other <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/05/18/student-debt-forgiveness-would-impact-nearly-every-aspect-of-peoples-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research suggests</a> that those saddled with student loan debt might be more likely to get married or have children if their dues were forgiven.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there’s a clear race and age gap when it comes to support for loan forgiveness. Support among Black (72 percent) and Hispanic (58 percent) adults was substantially stronger than it was among white respondents (47 percent), per the February YouGov/The Economist poll, which makes sense considering Black people <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-equity-insights/gender-racial-disparities-student-loan-debt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often start out with more student debt</a> than their white counterparts and also pay it down more slowly. Voters younger than 45 (36 percent for ages 18-29 and 37 percent for ages 30-44) gave the plan decent support, too, which also isn’t a huge surprise since younger Americans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/05/22/student-loan-borrowers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are similarly disproportionately likely</a> to hold student debt. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A December <a href="https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2212022_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_12-07-22_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> survey yielded similar results. Though it didn’t ask about a specific dollar amount, pollsters found that 41 percent of Black registered voters and 30 percent of Hispanic ones — compared with 20 percent of white respondents — said that it should be a priority for Congress to pass a bill providing student loan relief to Americans. There was an age divide here, too: A plurality of surveyed voters younger than 45 (36 percent for ages 18-34 and 28 percent for ages 35-44) agreed that it should be a “top” priority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But — like the courts — some surveys suggest that voters are split on whether Biden’s executive order exceeded his presidential powers. The February Fox News poll found that 44 percent of respondents said that he acted within his authority, while 49 percent said that he overstepped his boundaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, these numbers aren’t likely to mean much to the Supreme Court’s conservative justices. <a href="https://archive.ph/cgQGl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some polls</a>, too, suggest that the public isn’t expecting the court to side with Biden, either. Like other <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/looking-ahead-a-supreme-court-preview-for-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pending cases before the high court</a> these days, this is an inherently political fight because the court itself is political, but the justices are the ones who hold the power. </p>

<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Given the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-we-headed-for-a-recession-or-not/">current economic outlook</a>, a number of companies are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-companies-conducting-layoffs-in-2023-heres-the-list-11673288386">conducting layoffs</a> or <a href="https://mondo.com/insights/mass-layoffs-in-2022-whats-next-for-employees/">announcing plans to do so</a>. Recent polling by <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2023/02/27/younger-americans-think-recent-mass-layoffs-were-avoidable/">Morning Consult</a>, however, shows that many Americans don’t believe that these layoffs needed to take place. Per their survey, 50 percent of U.S. adults said that, based on the current economic environment, recent mass layoffs were either “totally” or “somewhat” avoidable. Just over one-third of all respondents (35 percent) felt that the layoffs were at least partially unavoidable. Generally, younger Americans were the least likely to buy into the notion that layoffs were inevitable: Sixty percent of Gen-Z adults said that these moves were unnecessary compared with 52 percent of Millennials and 49 percent of Gen-Xers. While the survey didn’t dig into <em>why </em>there’s a persistent age gap, previous reporting on the topic suggests that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/tech-layoffs-millennials-gen-x.html">could be because</a> younger people have likely never experienced a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/24/the-us-is-massively-underperforming-global-markets.html">stagnant stock market</a> in the same way older generations have. </li><li>Various reports claim that Biden <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-reelection-bid-announcement-after-state-of-the-union-address/">will announce</a> whether he’ll seek reelection within the next few months. As he deliberates his next move, though, polls show that he has increased support from inside of his own party, with 71 percent of Democratic voters saying they want him to continue to be their standard-bearer, according to an <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/national-poll-71-of-democratic-voters-think-biden-should-be-2024-nominee/">Emerson College Polling</a> report released earlier this week, while 29 percent said it should be someone else. The numbers are a marked increase from when Emerson asked Democratic primary or caucus voters the same question in January. <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/national-poll-bidens-approval-recovers-two-years-into-term-trump-maintains-lead-over-desantis-in-gop-primary/">In that survey</a>, just 58 percent of the party’s voters said they wanted Biden to seek a second term, while 42 percent said that another candidate should run instead.</li><li>Then there’s the GOP ticket. Of course, reader, you’re probably well aware by now that former President Donald Trump is seeking another term. But as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nikki-haley-is-taking-on-trump/">Republican primary field</a> takes shape, all eyes have been on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to announce a presidential campaign but has <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/">still emerged as a frontrunner</a> to challenge Trump for the nomination. As my colleague Nathaniel Rakich has written, DeSantis <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/desantis-is-polling-well-against-trump-as-long-as-no-one-else-runs/">tends to poll well</a> against Trump if they’re going head-to-head, but a recent <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/2024-poll-desantis-slides-as-trump-surges-to-1st-head-to-head-lead-in-months-202853979.html?ncid=twitter_yahoonewst_sjwumo1bpf4&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACepbmVZIbX6gV3s_mLxrjIYHq3dDdr7j1UT3CNpEKOoWaWtL1_GijhsTX0oTW67cnc16FltlRxWmtMySeLtEUuG5zjP2PoM_MfWF5e5RM5pDBDJZ1UBCkKKkN94RaQ9xmOXe8axNWfNaGufw1NrlOnU8RxPxAftIYoPy7X2Uw7K">Yahoo News/YouGov</a> poll suggests that the Florida governor’s support among GOP voters might be waning. Per the survey, Trump now leads DeSantis by eight points (47 percent to 39 percent), despite trailing behind the Florida governor by four percentage points (45 percent to 41 percent) in a previous <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/625047910/20230206-Yahoo-Tab-Biden">Yahoo News/YouGov</a> poll. Trump also led (43 percent) in a hypothetical three-way race between himself, DeSantis (31 percent) and former South Carolina governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley (8 percent). Haley announced her bid for the Republican nomination in February.</li><li>Voters have become increasingly wary of moves to ban <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06">critical race theory</a> and other discussions of race in schools as a number of state legislatures deliberate doing so — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/">again</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2023/2/28/voters-oppose-states-censoring-discussions-of-racism-in-schools">Data for Progress</a> poll, an overwhelming majority of respondents said that racism, slavery and the Black Lives Matter movement, among other things, should continue being taught in K-12 schools. Among likely voters, 83 percent said that slavery should be discussed “in an age-appropriate manner,” compared with 11 percent of respondents who said it shouldn’t be taught at all. Teaching about the American history of racism and racial equality, meanwhile, had similarly high support (79 percent) among those surveyed — as did discussions of modern-day racism and racial equality (69 percent) and social and political activism (66 percent). </li><li>Meanwhile, at the congressional level, some Republicans have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/28/biden-charging-republicans-wanting-cut-obamacare-medicaid/11361076002/">threatened to vote against</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republicans-could-vote-for-a-debt-ceiling-increase/">raising the debt ceiling</a> unless Biden agrees to significant cuts in federal spending. In response, Biden <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-says-republicans-coming-medicaid-002208727.html">has warned</a> that Obamacare and Medicaid could be on the chopping block — but that’s something voters are largely opposed to, according to recent survey data. Another <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/voters-oppose-funding-cuts-for-federal-programs-including-medicaid">Data for Progress</a> poll conducted from Feb. 23-27 found that voters are mostly in favor of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-helped-build-the-social-safety-net-why-are-many-now-against-expanding-it/">social safety net programs</a>, with 69 percent and 47 percent of likely voters, respectively, saying that Congress should <em>increase </em>funding for Social Security and Medicaid. On Medicaid specifically, respondents also overwhelmingly rejected certain changes to the program, like charging monthly premiums to Medicaid recipients, turning <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20190722.62519/">Medicaid into a block grant</a> and ending the Medicaid expansion from the Affordable Care Act.</li></ul>

<p data-paragraph="main">Three years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote and hybrid work are as popular as ever. Only 6 percent of employees able to do their jobs remotely want to return to the office full time, according to a <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/397751/returning-office-current-preferred-future-state-remote-work.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup survey published in August</a>. The vast majority of “remote-capable” workers<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This refers to the approximately 56 percent of full-time employees who told Gallup that their job can be done remotely from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> want to spend at least some of their workdays at home. When they’re forced to return to an office, they’re more likely to become burned out and to express intent to leave, according to Gallup.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s not all. The pandemic, combined with a strong labor market where workers have persistent power to demand the kinds of work cultures they want, means even more changes could be coming. After years of advocacy, many U.S. states are moving towards mandatory, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/events/state-momentum-for-paid-leave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid family</a> and <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/09/16/pandemic-prompts-more-states-to-mandate-paid-sick-leave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sick leave</a> for all workers. Meanwhile, companies are flirting with a four-day workweek in pilot programs worldwide, including in the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Policies like these have conventionally been seen as good for workers’ personal lives but bad for business. But thanks to the massive, sudden changes brought on by the pandemic, we now have more data than ever, and it shows that assumption is mostly wrong. Overall, policies that are good for employees’ personal lives are, when enacted correctly, good for their work lives, too. In fact, they seem to be good for everyone. The only question is whether we’ll start to see more companies adopt them.</p>



<h2><strong>Working from Home</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before the pandemic, just under 6 percent of employees were primarily working from home, but that had tripled to nearly 18 percent by the end of 2021, the most recent year available, <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/people-working-from-home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates</a>. While it’s still a minority of Americans overall, the shift to working from home is concentrated among certain kinds of workers — especially those who once filled downtown offices in cities on the coasts. In general, employees think they’re more productive when they work from home, while <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/glebtsipursky/2022/11/03/workers-are-less-productive-working-remotely-at-least-thats-what-their-bosses-think/?sh=18abb209286a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managers suspect that they’re not</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><p data-paragraph="main">Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/federal-reserve-shadow-branch-government-97592212</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Economists have been trying to figure out who’s right, using a couple different measures. A <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/08/research-knowledge-workers-are-more-productive-from-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Business Review study</a> found in August 2020 that working from home lets knowledge workers concentrate on tasks they think are important and want to do, and less time getting pulled into irrelevant meetings or working on someone else’s project.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study’s definition, “Knowledge workers apply subjective judgment to tasks, they decide what to do when, and they can withhold effort (by not fully engaging their brain) often without anyone noticing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> But when worker output can be measured, that’s even more helpful. The federal agency that reviews patent applications already measured worker productivity based on a metric that included actions completed in a specific period of time. A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3494473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study in the Strategic Management Journal</a> found before the pandemic that workers’ ability to work from anywhere increased productivity by 4.4 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of that may simply be that workers are spending more time completing tasks when they would otherwise be commuting: A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper found that employees were working <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27612/w27612.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">48.5 more minutes a day</a> during lockdowns in 2020. Another NBER working paper found that <a href="https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/w30866.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workers devote about 40 percent of the time they saved</a> from not <a href="https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/w30866.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commuting to their jobs</a>. Anecdotally, some <a href="https://www.inc.com/melissa-angell/will-sick-days-ever-be-the-same.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workers worry</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/11/03/sick-days-disappear-in-the-remote-working-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they shouldn’t take a sick day</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/should-i-take-sick-day-working-from-home-pto-burnout-2022-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for minor illnesses</a> while working from home. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, working from home could turn out to be better for the company than it is for the workers – or, at least, the situation is more complicated than it may appear on the surface. Workers are <a href="https://www.greatplacetowork.com/resources/blog/remote-work-productivity-study-finds-surprising-reality-2-year-study#:~:text=Working%20from%20home%20is%20just,employees%20started%20working%20from%20home." target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally happier working remotely and report higher productivity and better work-life balance</a>, unless their work <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2023/01/work-home-success-linked-worklife-boundaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creeps into off hours</a>, according to the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University. It found that working from home outside of normal work hours is associated with worse psychological outcomes and family conflict.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Working from home instead of an office has other downsides: some people do miss face time with their coworkers and meetings can take a little longer to organize and set up, which is part of the reason <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/390632/future-hybrid-work-key-questions-answered-data.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hybrid models with some in-office workdays are emerging as the most popular</a>. But all of those problems cry out for the need for new management styles to <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/10/the-realities-of-remote-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set boundaries around the workday</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/remote-managers-are-having-trust-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let go of some old ideas about “face time.”</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead of addressing those problems, many managers have been reluctant to believe the positives of working from home and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto-wfh-hybrid-2023-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major companies have persisted in return-to-office policies</a>. The drive seems largely driven by managers who are struggling to the new work environment as well: In the beginning of the pandemic, 40 percent lacked confidence they could manage their employees remotely, <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/remote-managers-are-having-trust-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to another study from the Harvard Business Review</a>, though <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/10/what-great-remote-managers-do-differently" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some managers have adjusted</a> better than others.  </p>



<h2><strong>Four-day workweeks</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/21/four-day-week-uk-trial-success-pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pilot program introducing the U.K. to a 32-hour workweek wrapped up</a> last month. Sixty-one participating companies spent six months experimenting with a four-day workweek. All but five will continue it into the future. Surveys taken after the pilot found employees were less stressed, slept better and were better able to maintain work-life balance, according to reporting from The Guardian. The surveys also found that sick days fell by two-thirds, and turnover fell by more than half. Overall, the companies reported no drop in productivity, and even an increase in some cases. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Even before and then throughout the pandemic, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/new-zealand-experiment-finds-4-day-work-week-a-success.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/australian-workers-at-global-company-to-trial-four-day-week-after-success-of-new-zealand-pilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firms</a> around the world began experimenting with shorter workweeks. In these four-day pilot programs, employees keep their pay and pledge to keep their productivity up to what it had been before the trial. They’ve found, in general, that workers are happier, less stressed and also get at least the same amount of work done as they did working five days. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Companies in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/17/four-day-week-worker-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iceland, Belgium</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/03/15/spain-is-the-latest-country-to-try-a-four-day-workweek/?sh=422d61e3f1da" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/02/is-a-four-day-work-week-catching-on-in-asia-it-depends-on-the-country.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/new-zealand-experiment-finds-4-day-work-week-a-success.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Zealand</a> are experimenting with shorter work weeks, and 38 companies in the U.S. and Canada <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/four-day-workweek-pilot-program-is-now-underway-in-the-us-and-canada.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are undergoing a similar trial</a>. This year, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/3835951-state-considers-bill-urging-companies-to-switch-to-4-day-workweek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland is</a> considering legislation that would encourage employers to experiment with a four-day workweek. Fifty-nine percent of Americans <a href="https://archive.is/wmEAS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support the idea</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other than the recent trial in the U.K., most of the reported benefits of the four-day workweek come from anecdotes. Managers have reported some challenges as they figure out how to meet client demand in the new environment. But so far the four-day workweek trials have been voluntary, which might mean the companies that choose to do them are more motivated to solve these problems than they would be if the change were forced. An advocacy group pushing the pilots, <a href="https://www.4dayweek.com/why-pilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 Day Week Global</a>, argues that the change is possible when managers measure results instead of simply hours worked. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The five-day workweek in the U.S. is, after all, a relic of a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/where-the-five-day-workweek-came-from/378870/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades-old law that sought to balance worker and employer needs in a completely different cultural and economic context</a>. It was instituted after an era of rapid industrialization, during which factories had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/03/how-the-8-hour-workday-changed-how-americans-work.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demanded much longer days and weeks</a> from their employees. In response, labor organizations around the globe demanded new laws to protect workers. Maybe those limits are simply an outdated relic of that time.</p>



<h2><strong>Paid Leave</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s no federal law in the U.S. mandating that <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/benefits-leave/sickleave#:~:text=Federal%20law%20does%20not%20require,pay%20you%20for%20that%20time." target="_blank" rel="noopener">employers provide paid sick leave for their employees</a>. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ebs2_09222022.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearly a quarter of workers</a> — especially <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-state-of-paid-sick-time-in-the-u-s-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-income workers</a>, often in the kinds of service jobs deemed essential during the pandemic — can’t call in sick when they get a cold or their child is sent home from school with a fever. Under certain conditions, workers are entitled to periods of unpaid leave, but the fact that it’s unpaid can make it a burden to use. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/inflations-41-year-high-impacted-american-life-fivethirtyeight-95850805</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">This changed briefly during the pandemic, when federal law dictated that employers provide up to two weeks of paid leave for their workers affected by the coronavirus. That expired <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/ffcra#:~:text=The%20requirement%20that%20employers%20provide,31%2C%202020." target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the end of 2020</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The benefits of paid sick leave became clear when the U.S. was trying to stop the spread of a deadly virus. But advocates had been pushing for mandated paid sick leave long before. For the past decade, states have been moving to fill in the gap, and today <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/09/16/pandemic-prompts-more-states-to-mandate-paid-sick-leave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 states have mandatory paid sick leave</a>, as well as a handful of counties and cities including Washington, D.C. This year, at least five states are considering such bills.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not surprising that paid sick leave is better for workers who have access to it. A study in Health Affairs found that state-mandated sick pay led to a <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00098#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20implementation%20of,per%201%2C000%20population%20per%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.6 percent reduction in emergency room visits</a>, indicating that workers able to take paid sick leave were able to deal with health problems before they worsened. And a study from Drexel University also <a href="https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/news/do-paid-sick-leave-mandates-increase-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found that paid sick leave mandates led to a 6 percent increase in productivity</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eleven states <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/labor-and-employment/state-family-and-medical-leave-laws#:~:text=11%20states%E2%80%94California%2C%20Colorado%2C,paid%20family%20and%20medical%20leave." target="_blank" rel="noopener">require employers to provide paid family and medical leave for longer periods</a>, although not all of those laws have been enacted yet. At least five more states have introduced similar laws or pilot programs this year. These kinds of laws are popular: Eighty-five percent of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2017/03/23/americans-widely-support-paid-family-and-medical-leave-but-differ-over-specific-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans say workers should have access to paid leave</a> for their own health problems. A 2021 analysis of New York’s paid leave law found that employers weren’t hurt by the mandate, and <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/study-finds-paid-family-leave-does-not-hurt-employers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actually found it easier to plan for employee’s long absences</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Employers seem to understand that many of these benefits are good, since they have long often offered things like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2022/02/04/flexibility-is-the-most-empowering-benefit-for-employees-new-poll/?sh=1fdd3fe58b19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flexible work</a> and <a href="https://www.adp.com/spark/articles/2022/06/paid-family-leave-why-its-essential-and-how-to-design-an-effective-policy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid leave as benefits</a> to employees to try to recruit top talent. But that leaves many more workers out. When employers have decided to require return to office, they’ve often framed remote work as “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/14/tesla-struggles-with-elon-musks-strict-return-to-office-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phoning it in</a>” or said that in-person work is good for “<a href="https://technical.ly/company-culture/amazon-office-return-tech-workers/#:~:text=According%20to%20Amazon%2C%20the%20switch,invent%20with%20in-person%20work." target="_blank" rel="noopener">company culture</a>” without offering much evidence. When it comes to a shorter workweek and paid leave, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2017/01/30/paid-family-leave-balancing-benefits-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many businesses object to the up-front costs</a>, even if they benefit later from worker retention. So far, the evidence of all the potential benefits hasn’t been enough for employers to invest widely in new work cultures. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">American government is designed to have components that are not directly accountable to the public. The Supreme Court is probably the most recognizable example, but it’s not the only one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In her new book, “Limitless: The Federal Reserve Takes On A New Age Of Crisis,” New York Times reporter Jeanna Smialek focuses on another unelected institution with a lot of power over American life: the Federal Reserve. The Fed has great power, but, unlike the Supreme Court, Americans on the whole are pretty unaware of the role it plays in their lives. According to an Ipsos poll, 90 percent of Americans say their knowledge of the Fed ranges from not much to nothing at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, Smialek argues that over the past century, through successive crises, the Fed has accumulated the power to choose winners and losers across American markets and society on the whole. And if partisan loyalists were to make their way onto the Fed board, that degree of power could be abused.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Donald Trump this, Ron DeSantis that. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-might-other-republicans-challenge-trump-for-the-2024-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The race</a> for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-draft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 Republican presidential nomination</a> has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nikki-haley-is-taking-on-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting all the attention lately</a>. But at least one person is trying to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stop-trying-to-make-fetch-happen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make fetch</a> (and history) happen on the Democratic side. Last weekend, self-help author, motivational speaker and 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson <a href="https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/posts/pfbid02GFviLmtn7rEtQn5tA5J2h2G88QVWBdQiUD3Yfp8S6xVtqR93zhpEKVhM6k2oggxMl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> she was running for president again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden hasn’t announced his bid to seek reelection yet, but it <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jill-biden-joe-biden-reelection-1659403d211d40212abbfef3b9847491" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will likely come soon</a>. That means Williamson will attempt to defeat a sitting president for renomination, which has never happened in the modern primary era. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the modern primary era has few examples of competitive primaries against sitting presidents, and it’s unwise to forge iron laws of politics (i.e., “sitting presidents are invincible in primaries”) from such a small sample size. And conditions may be ripe for a serious primary challenge against Biden, though it probably won’t be Williamson (more on that in a minute).</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/marianne-williamson-running-president-shot-joe-biden-97588580</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Polling suggests that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of Biden as their nominee again. Only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they want the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else, according to an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/05/poll-biden-trump-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC News/Washington Post poll</a> from Jan. 27-Feb. 1. That <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-unusually-lukewarm-about-a-second-biden-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of enthusiasm</a> is unusual. According to <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23460217/cnn-poll-americans-have-little-appetite-for-biden-trump-rematch-in-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical CNN polling</a>, majorities of Democrats wanted to renominate Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012, and a majority of Republicans wanted to renominate Trump in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early polling</a> of the Democratic primary contest also shows Biden getting nowhere close to majority support. For example, he received support from just 36 percent of Democratic registered voters in a <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HHP_Feb2023_KeyResults.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 15-16 national poll</a> from Harris/the Harvard University Center for American Political Studies, while the rest of the poll’s respondents opted for the likes of Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s an old saying in politics: You can’t beat somebody with nobody. Harris, Clinton and Sanders are extremely unlikely to challenge Biden, as is anyone with significant stature in the party. So, for now, it’s just Williamson — and she doesn’t fit the profile of someone who could give Biden a real run for his money.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What are Democrats looking for in a Biden alternative? First, they’re <em>not</em> looking for someone more progressive than him. Only 21 percent of Democratic registered voters agree with the idea that Biden is too conservative, according to a <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2023/02/13111212/2302047_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_02-13-23_HD.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> from Feb. 10-12. Instead, they are looking for someone more electable. According to an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-2024/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSRS/CNN poll</a> from last year, a plurality of Democratic-aligned voters who wanted to replace him on the ticket said it was because they were afraid he would lose in the general election. In addition, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-norc-poll-biden-2024-presidential-prospects-c843c5af6775b4c8a0cff8e2b1db03f6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up interviews</a> with respondents from <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-apathetic-biden-2024-dealbreaker/story?id=96949234" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple recent polls</a> have found that many Democrats think the 80-year-old Biden is too old.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Williamson’s candidacy doesn’t address any of these concerns. First, while Williamson isn’t quite as old as Biden, she is 70. If she wins in 2024, she would be the second-oldest newly elected president in U.S. history. Second, Williamson is challenging Biden from his left, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/26/marianne-williamson-president-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguing</a> that he needs to pursue progressive policies more boldly. And finally, few Democrats are likely to call Williamson an electoral juggernaut. She has never held elected office; only <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-offices-are-good-stepping-stones-to-the-presidency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one person in U.S. history</a> has been elected president without political or military experience. She has also lost her two previous bids for office, her 2020 presidential campaign and a 2014 run for Congress. Her unconventional philosophy could hurt her as well: <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-marianne-williamson-could-win-the-2020-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Her 2020 campaign</a> was tinged with an alt-spiritualism that went beyond your average progressive politics. Her suggestion that “the power of the mind” <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/04/marianne-williamson-hurricane-dorian-tweet-1480409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed the course of a hurricane</a> earned her a fair amount of ridicule, and her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/politics/kfile-marianne-williamson-anti-vaxxer-theories/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past skepticism of vaccinations</a> could hit differently in the era of COVID-19. And while many Americans share Williamson’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-marianne-williamsons-brand-of-spirituality-isnt-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“spiritual but not religious” identity</a>, those Americans tend to be highly educated — and highly educated voters tend to be skeptical of nonconformist views like Williamson’s.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was unsurprising, then, that the more Democrats got to know Williamson throughout the 2020 campaign, the less they liked her. In an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-2020-candidates-are-more-or-less-popular-than-they-should-be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average of polls conducted in May 2019</a>, 13 percent of Democrats had a favorable opinion of Williamson, and 10 percent had an unfavorable one. But then, in an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/after-two-debates-warren-is-getting-more-popular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average of polls conducted Aug. 1-25, 2019</a>, 22 percent of Democrats had a favorable opinion, and 26 percent had an unfavorable view. So far this year, there haven’t been any polls conducted of Williamson’s favorability, but it’s hard to think of a reason why Democrats’ opinions of her would have improved over the past four years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">During the 2020 campaign, my colleague Geoffrey Skelley devised a five-point scale to measure the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-rate-a-trump-challenger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seriousness of then-President Trump’s primary challengers</a>. At this point in the 2024 campaign, it seems likely that Williamson will fall somewhere between a Level 1 and Level 2 challenge to Biden — if she even makes it to primary season. In 2020, a lack of campaign funds <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-marianne-williamsons-unconventional-presidential-bid-didnt-catch-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced her to drop out</a> before any voting took place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She’s more prominent than your average Level 1 challenger, whom Skelley described as “perennial or no-name candidates who make the ballot in a handful of states and win just a sliver of the national primary vote.” But she may struggle to achieve the success of Pat Buchanan in the 1992 Republican primary, the poster child for Level 2: “This candidate could build a national political organization and win a not-insignificant chunk of the primary vote, or at least enough to force a conversation about the direction the party is headed.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, she’s unlikely to give Biden a serious scare. While she could conceivably become the left’s protest candidate to Biden (especially if she is the only prominent progressive to run), that isn’t a realistic path to the nomination (just ask “President Sanders”). She is also not positioned to exploit Biden’s more glaring weaknesses, like age and electability. So while there may be an appetite for a serious primary challenge to Biden, Williamson ain’t it.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>Things are heating up in 2024’s U.S. Senate races! On Monday, Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2023/02/27/rep-elissa-slotkin-declares-u-s-senate-bid-stabenow-seat-candidacy/69947953007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced her candidacy</a> for Michigan’s open Senate seat, and last week, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester declared he was <a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/tester-announces-2024-re-election-bid/article_0fe7ed22-d036-5450-a448-088f3dae917a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running for reelection</a> in Montana. (All these early announcements are putting the 2024 presidential race to shame. C’mon, Joe Biden and Ron DeSantis, step on it!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So for this week’s FiveThirtyEight politics chat, Alex Samuels and Geoffrey Skelley are joining me to check in on how the battle for the Senate is shaping up. How’s it going, guys?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter):<strong> </strong>Howdy, Nathaniel! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f920.png" alt="🤠"> All is well over here. And given my pro-chat proclivities, I’m very glad we’re doing these regularly now!!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, so first things first — Slotkin and Tester running is good news for Democrats, right?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>In the grand scheme of things, Tester’s decision is one of the most important of the cycle. If he hadn’t sought reelection, Democrats would have been cooked in Montana.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tester’s ability to outrun Montana’s red partisan lean is a critical part of this. Former President Donald Trump carried Montana by 16 percentage points <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=30&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2020</a>, placing the state roughly 21 points to the right of the country as a whole. In that same election, a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/10/29/montana-senate-polling-steve-daines-steve-bullock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively popular Democratic governor</a> (Steve Bullock) <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=30&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still lost</a> 55 percent to 45 percent against GOP Sen. Steve Daines. But Tester has survived a presidential cycle before, defeating a strong opponent (Republican Rep. Denny Rehberg) <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2012&amp;fips=30&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2012</a>, even while Mitt Romney <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2012&amp;fips=30&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was carrying the state</a> by 14 points. The state may be a tad redder now than it was back then, but Tester makes this election a toss-up instead of probably a “Solid Republican” race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>That’s right, Geoffrey. One more reason it’s good for Democrats that Tester is running: <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/reelection-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate incumbents rarely lose</a>. One of the worst recent cycles for them was 1980, when Ronald Reagan’s coattails helped Republicans <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Chpt-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pick up 12 seats</a>. But since then, according to Open Secrets, the reelection rate for Senate incumbents has never dropped below 75 percent. In fact, it’s more common for incumbents to win 85 percent or more of races. Remember last year, too, when Republicans were excited at the prospect of picking up multiple seats and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/politics/senate-incumbents-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a single incumbent lost</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/deal-2024-senate-map-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-97363909</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>As for Slotkin, she seems like a solid candidate for Democrats. Having worked for the CIA and Defense Department before entering congressional politics, she’s got a background in national security that might appeal to more centrist voters. She’s also a <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/17/elissa-slotkin-tom-barrett/69568316007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very strong fundraiser</a>. To that point, her Senate campaign <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2023/02/28/slotkin-raises-1-2m-on-first-day-of-senate-campaign/69952200007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought in</a> $1.2 million on its first day.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She won’t necessarily make people on the left happy, but Michigan is a purplish state and Slotkin has won on purple turf three times now in varied environments: In 2018, <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2018GEN_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she beat an incumbent</a> in a very Democratic-leaning cycle; in 2020, she <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2020GEN_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held onto her seat</a> in a more neutral presidential year; and in 2022, she won reelection <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2022GEN_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by a larger margin</a> than ever before, even though that was a more favorable year for the GOP nationwide.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, our friends at <a href="https://split-ticket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Split Ticket</a> have calculated a WAR score (after the baseball stat <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/wins-above-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wins above replacement</a>) for politicians to quantify candidate quality, and Slotkin has consistently been a strong performer. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No comment on Slotkin's ideological bent, but if Democrats want to maximize their chances of winning <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MISen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MISen</a> (where they're already favored), she's as good as you can get.<br><br>Here are her overperformance/WAR scores from our <a href="https://twitter.com/SplitTicket_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SplitTicket_</a> model.<br><br>2022: D+2.8<br>2020: D+2.4<br>2018: D+3.8</p>— Lakshya Jain (@lxeagle17) <a href="https://twitter.com/lxeagle17/status/1630263952184848386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2023</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">She’ll need to get past the primary first, though. As you mentioned, Slotkin isn’t a favorite of the party’s left flank. For example, she voted to <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/house-votes-to-overturn-dc-criminal-code-and-voting-laws/3275804/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nullify a Washington, D.C., law</a> to reduce the maximum penalties for certain crimes. But so far, she’s managed to clear the field. Other potentially strong candidates, like <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2023/02/26/michigan-lt-gov-gilchrist-says-he-wont-run-for-u-s-senate/69946606007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist</a> and <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/michigan-rep-haley-stevens-says-she-wont-run-for-u-s-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Haley Stevens</a>, have given the race a pass. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>The other major politician <a href="https://www.wlns.com/news/local-news/michigan-democrat-elissa-slotkin-formally-announces-run-for-open-senate-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who might run</a> is Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who would probably have a solid campaign slogan as a candidate who’s “protected democracy” in Michigan. But one outside name of interest is Nasser Beydoun, a businessman <a href="https://arabamericannews.com/2022/12/23/businessman-nasser-beydoun-announces-u-s-senate-exploratory-committee-and-statewide-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has held leadership roles</a> in a number of organizations focused on the Arab American community in Michigan, which has a larger share of people who claim Arab ancestry than any other state (around 2 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>What might benefit Slotkin — or any other Democrat, really — is the fact that Michigan is a state where there’s not a particularly strong GOP challenger waiting in the wings, either. Newly elected Rep. John James, who has lost two successive Senate races, said <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-2022-midterm-elections-debbie-stabenow-michigan-7d6e8bb4c2d433bf3fc41fa1b13b2188" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he won’t run for the seat</a>. And I know <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/27/us/politics/elissa-slotkin-senate-michigan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s chatter</a> about former Rep. Peter Meijer, but his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/04/meijer-trump-impeachment-vote-defeat-00049843" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote to impeach Trump</a> after the Jan. 6 insurrection could make it more challenging for him to win a GOP primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, how are the candidate pools shaping up on the Republican side? Not just in these two states, but everywhere?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>So far, the Michigan GOP <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2023/02/16/state-board-of-ed-member-nikki-snyder-launches-u-s-senate-campaign/69909530007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only one declared candidate of note</a> — State Board of Education member Nikki Snyder — but <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/22/republicans-fight-chance-unseat-slotkin-swing-district/5470608002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she failed</a> to make the ballot to run against Slotkin back in 2020. A number of other candidates have expressed interest in running, but it’s unclear at this point who else might jump in.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Montana, though, there are a <a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/02/22/tester-run-helps-democrats-but-montana-still-an-uphill-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple of high-profile Republicans</a> who might run: the state’s two House members, Matt Rosendale and Ryan Zinke. Rosendale, however, lost to Tester <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2018&amp;fips=30&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2018</a>, and Zinke has a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/19/1129846170/in-montana-house-race-gop-candidate-struggles-to-shake-off-trump-era-scandals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of scandals</a> from his days serving as Trump’s secretary of the interior, which may help explain his underwhelming 3-point win in 2022 to return to the House in a seat that’s about <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/montana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 points redder</a> than the nation as a whole. The GOP may be better off with a candidate like state Attorney General Austin Knudsen, <a href="https://www.mtpr.org/podcast/capitol-talk/2023-02-24/tester-is-in-racicot-is-out-and-moderates-rack-up-some-wins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who might also get in</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>It’s telling that the National Republican Senatorial Committee — which largely stayed neutral last year — has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3802872-gop-grapples-with-candidate-quality-problem-ahead-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaled an interest</a> in being more involved in open-seat primaries this go-around. Then again, maybe that strategy isn’t that surprising considering some of the party’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/us/politics/kari-lake-arizona-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most controversial losers</a> from 2022 are launching campaigns or considering running in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, we <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/primary-project-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracked NRSC endorsements</a> during the 2022 cycle, and it didn’t endorse a single nonincumbent Senate candidate — a <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/rick-scott-defends-hands-off-approach-to-senate-gop-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deliberate strategy by then-NRSC Chair Rick Scott</a> that may have backfired given <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/candidate-quality-mattered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how weak Republican Senate candidates were</a> that year. But this year, it has already <a href="https://twitter.com/ercovey/status/1620420012170412038?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essentially endorsed</a> Rep. Jim Banks in Indiana, for instance, and more endorsements could be coming down the pike.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Separately, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell would probably advocate for their involvement, no? He was arguably the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/mcconnell-says-republicans-may-not-win-senate-control-citing-candidate-rcna43777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most vocal Republican</a> decrying the party’s candidate quality last year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I think the jury is still out on just how much the NRSC will involve itself in the 2024 primaries. In a state like Montana, if there are a couple major officeholders running, I suspect the NRSC won’t intervene. But in a state like Pennsylvania, you could have a GOP primary between former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick and 2022 gubernatorial loser Doug Mastriano. Though neither has entered the race, if that were the matchup, you could definitely <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-florida-state-government-pennsylvania-indiana-db829dcce00e577f23cc2235b7f013b1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see the NRSC get involved</a> to tip the scales toward McCormick. Mastriano, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-biden-pennsylvania-donald-trump-campaigns-3e474bed5a86efcc8f08711716fee7c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vocal denier</a> of the 2020 election results, <a href="https://www.witf.org/2022/11/11/republican-doug-mastriano-has-yet-to-concede-pa-governors-race-after-democrat-josh-shapiro-declared-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got blown out last November</a>, and he would be a pushover for Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, McCormick doesn’t exactly have a great track record, having very narrowly lost to Mehmet Oz in the 2022 Senate primary (Oz went on to lose to now-Sen. John Fetterman). But McCormick brings a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/david-mccormick-net-worth-senate-2022-20220418.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ton of personal wealth</a> to the table, which could help Republicans; they wouldn’t have to throw as much outside money into the race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Do you guys think the NRSC would be wise to intervene more, given how flawed Republicans’ 2022 Senate candidates were? It seems like, if left to their own devices, GOP primary voters often don’t pick the strongest candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I think parties should look to intervene a fair bit if they’re worried that highly flawed Senate candidates might have a path to victory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in recent times — even further back to, say, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/08/15/has-trump-put-the-republican-party-in-danger-of-repeating-the-2010-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2010</a> — the GOP <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/candidate-quality-mattered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has had that problem</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, when we talk about the “party,” the NRSC is just a small part of that. And the Senate Leadership Fund, a Super PAC aligned with McConnell, can spend a lot. But that’s not the whole party these days! More insurgent-minded groups like the Club for Growth might not agree with the more establishment-flavored choices the NRSC and SLF might prefer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Yes, Nathaniel, but I also think it would be wise for them to intervene because candidate quality on the Democratic side is so good. The Democrats in the toughest 2024 races are arguably among the party’s strongest. Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia (assuming he runs for reelection), Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Tester have all been battle-tested in their respective red states, and they’ve all overcome their states’ Republican leans — even in presidential years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, Alex, as you allude to, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-democrats-are-worried-about-2024-senate-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate map is really bad for Democrats</a> this cycle. They are defending eight seats in states with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan leans</a> that are redder than the nation as a whole. And as a reminder, they currently have just a 51-49 majority in the Senate (thanks to three independents who align with them), so they can afford to lose only one seat if Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris win reelection. (And if they don’t, Democrats can’t afford to lose any!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this stage, what do you guys think are Republicans’ best opportunities to pick up those one or two seats they need?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>If Manchin runs for reelection, he would easily be the most endangered Democratic incumbent given that West Virginia went to Trump by nearly 40 points in 2020. When Manchin was on the ballot last, in 2018, he was able to convince Republicans to split their ticket — but I think that’ll be really hard for him next year since it’s a presidential cycle and the top of the ticket could influence his chances down-ballot. (For what it’s worth, reader, the last time he was on the ballot in a presidential year, in 2012, Manchin won by 24 points, while Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney won the state by nearly 27. But <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-in-10-americans-named-political-polarization-as-a-top-issue-facing-the-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan polarization</a> has only gotten worse since then.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>As Alex said, West Virginia <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-senate-2024-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tops the charts</a> — <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/number+one+with+a+bullet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a bullet</a>. Manchin has had an incredible run winning as a Democrat in what is, along with Wyoming, the reddest state in the country. Getting enough people to split their tickets in a presidential environment isn’t going to be easy, especially if <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2023/01/12/kentucky-beshear-ranks-as-most-popular-democratic-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular</a> Republican Gov. Jim Justice <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2023/02/16/gop-poll-shows-jim-justice-would-be-a-strong-senate-candidate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is his opponent</a>. But GOP Rep. Alex Mooney, who has aligned himself closely with Trump, <a href="https://www.wsaz.com/2022/11/15/congressman-alex-mooney-announces-2024-senate-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is already in the race</a>, and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey <a href="https://www.weirtondailytimes.com/news/local-news/2023/02/morrisey-says-hes-mulling-his-options-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could take another shot</a>, after narrowly losing to Manchin <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2018&amp;fips=54&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2018</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, our friends at Sabato’s Crystal Ball are starting West Virginia out with a <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2024-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Leans Republican” rating</a>. It’s unusual for those forecasters to put an incumbent any worse than “toss-up.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plus, the situation would get even worse for Democrats if Manchin doesn’t run for reelection. He’s 75 years old, and has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3869930-manchin-says-that-right-now-hes-not-running-for-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">played coy</a> about whether he’s running again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>After West Virginia, the most vulnerable Democratic seats are Ohio and Montana. Tester faces a tough bid, but don’t sleep on Brown being the weaker of the two. Whereas Tester clearly outran the Democratic presidential ticket in 2012, Brown <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2012&amp;fips=39&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did about as well as</a> President Barack Obama <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2012&amp;fips=39&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that year</a>. And while Brown also won in 2018, he faced a very <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-ohio-sherrod-brown-jim-renacci-98370fa21b6548acb5b06a8c906d34a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weak Republican opponent</a> in then-Rep. Jim Renacci. So Brown may not be quite as much of an outperformer as some think.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps that’s why you could see a bevy of GOP contenders looking to challenge him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Brown is an interesting test case, Geoff, given that he’s the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/politics/sherrod-brown-ohio-2024-swing-state-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only Democrat</a> to win a nonjudicial statewide race in Ohio since 2012. But between him, Tester and Manchin, I’d argue that Brown is in the best position given his <a href="https://time.com/6227612/sherrod-brown-popularity-ohio-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">populist street cred</a> and the fact that he’s found success <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/opinion/columns/guest/2023/02/08/opinion-mike-dolan-can-sherrod-brown-beat-back-republican-challengers-in-red-leaning-ohio-us-senate/69862434007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with Republicans</a> while bucking conservative trends in his state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>So far, Brown’s <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/01/16/ohio-u-s-senate-race-2024-matt-dolan-announces-bid-against-sherrod-brown/69792478007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main GOP opponent</a> is state Sen. Matt Dolan, who’s personally very wealthy (his family owns the Cleveland Guardians baseball franchise). Dolan finished a close third in Ohio’s 2022 Senate primary, running as a conservative — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/16/matt-dolan-ohio-00040056" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but not a Trumpy one</a>. You could see some other 2022 candidates, like investment banker Mike Gibbons, run too. But some major officeholders in Ohio <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/another-bruising-senate-race-brews-ohio-republicans-target-sherrod-bro-rcna57373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also eyeing this race</a>, and they’re the ones to watch, especially Secretary of State Frank LaRose, <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2023/02/17/ohio-frank-larose-weighs-senate-bid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who could be the toughest opponent</a> Brown has faced since first defeating Mike DeWine for this seat in 2006 (DeWine was a senator back then; now he’s governor). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Yeah, Dolan hails from the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/10/politics/matt-dolan-senate-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more centrist wing of the party</a>. But I’m sure he’ll have some competition in no time, so the GOP could also shoot itself in the foot again if they field a super-right-wing candidate who alienates voters there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, I think we can all agree that West Virginia, Montana and Ohio are, in some order, Republicans’ best pickup opportunities. But what other states might they have a good shot in?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>The other Frost Belt state of note is Wisconsin, where Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin <a href="https://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/newswire/tammy-baldwins-third-term-democrats-may-difficult-time-2024-keep-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t yet said whether she’s running again</a>. But assuming she does, the GOP will want to make a play for that seat too, of course. There hasn’t yet been much action there, but you might see someone like GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/13/wisconsin-republicans-who-could-challenge-sen-tammy-baldwin-in-2024/69871895007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decide to challenge her</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also a couple key seats in the southwest: Arizona and Nevada. In the latter, Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-biden-remains-unpopular-in-nevada-as-2024-campaign-approaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will face a tough reelection bid</a> in the perennial swing state. It’s early days, but one name to watch might be Sam Brown, an Army veteran who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/10-elections-to-watch-in-nevada-south-carolina-and-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracted a fair amount of support</a> on his way to <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/laxalt-beats-brown-in-senate-primary-nevadas-gop-house-field-takes-shape" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finishing second</a>, behind Adam Laxalt, in the 2022 GOP primary for Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’ll definitely be keeping a close <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀"> on the Arizona race, Geoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It has the unusual distinction of (maybe) being a three-way race: between independent incumbent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego and the eventual Republican nominee. The fact that some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://morningconsult.com/2023/01/11/sinema-approval-rating-post-party-switch/" target="_blank">early polling</a> in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/az-senate-gallego-leads-in-all-head-to-head-matchups" target="_blank">the state</a> shows that Sinema isn’t doing too hot should make it a golden opportunity. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after two high-profile losses in Arizona in 2022 — for Senate and governor — is it not possible that Republicans blow their chances here again with a weak candidate? (I know I probably sound like a broken record at this point — forgive me, readers!) Defeated election denier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/us/politics/kari-lake-arizona-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kari Lake</a> and wealthy businessman <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/17/midterm-losers-gop-primaries-00083137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blake Masters</a> are both reportedly considering a run for Senate in 2024. Those are the types of opponents that Democrats and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-arizona-kyrsten-sinema-united-states-senate-us-democratic-party-669ea92098adebfd20b4a749e4a761cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic-aligned independents</a> alike dream of facing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>If you want a race where Republican bigwigs might try to get involved, it’s Arizona. If Lake and/or Masters run, they will look for a stronger alternative.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>That’s exactly right. If Arizona Republicans should have learned anything over the last few years, it’s that maybe they shouldn’t cater to the most extreme side of Trump’s base. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>The potential three-way dynamic of a race with an independent senator is also very hard to predict, especially this early. We don’t know that Sinema will even seek reelection — I suspect <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-kyrsten-sinema-left-the-democratic-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she switched from a Democrat to an independent</a> not only to avoid a Democratic primary challenge but also in the hopes that someone like Gallego wouldn’t run and risk splitting the liberal and moderate vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That gambit didn’t work, though, so you have Sinema, who had more than $8 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/AZ/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in her campaign account</a> at the end of 2022, potentially running third in a three-person race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, she has been in third place in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2024/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every survey of the race I’ve seen</a>. I wouldn’t be surprised if she just retires.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Historically, incumbents in her position <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1970&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have won</a> when <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2006&amp;fips=9&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the</a> major-party <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2018&amp;fips=23&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates struggled</a>, making it more of a two-way race between the independent/third-party incumbent and the other major-party contender. But in a strongly polarized political era, I’m not sure Sinema can pull that off. She’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/us/politics/sinema-censure-arizona-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infuriated Democrats so much</a> that she <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/1/dfp_az_sen_p2024_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably would have lost</a> to Gallego in the primary if she had sought renomination. But she’s also a former Democratic senator, which may make an independent campaign tough to sell to Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Do you think not having Sinema as their candidate will hurt Democrats’ chances of winning, though? I feel like the most straightforward path to keeping their majority is to run incumbents who are already well known to voters (despite the uphill climb a lot of them face).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Sinema is <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/az-senate-gallego-leads-in-all-head-to-head-matchups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so unpopular with Democrats</a> that she may not splinter the party base as much as you’d expect on paper. As OH Predictive Insights found a few weeks ago, Sinema has a better favorability rating among Republicans than among Democrats!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>As I said earlier, Senate incumbents rarely lose!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>They do lose sometimes, though.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>But not often. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Senate incumbents also rarely leave the party they got elected with and run as independents!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, it’s a weird situation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Right now, I’d expect Sinema to lose if she does run. I think having alienated much of her old party’s base makes it a tough proposition to win a three-way race. Her path to victory may be something like winning one-fifth of Democrats, one-third of Republicans and half of independents, which would give her about 35 percent of the vote. That could be enough to win a three-way race, but that scenario might be her ceiling: Is she <em>really</em> going to get one-third of Republicans and half of independents? I’m not so sure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the eventual GOP nominee will be important to that equation, and we’re a long way from knowing who that will be. (Gallego seems likely to be the Democrats’ choice.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, so that’s a <em>lot</em> of pickup opportunities for Republicans! Do Democrats have any realistic pickup opportunities of their own? Places where they can offset, e.g., a loss in a place like Arizona?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Given the decently strong performance of Democratic Senate candidates in both <a href="https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/florida/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> and Texas in 2018 (<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/06/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-texas-midterm-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m looking at you, Beto O’Rourke!</a>), incumbent Sens. Rick Scott and Ted Cruz are hardly safe. But it’s crazy to think that those two states might be the most promising pickup opportunities for Democrats next year!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>They’re the only real takeover opportunities for Democrats, and that speaks to the difficulties the party faces in holding onto the Senate. Republicans just don’t have much turf to defend. Florida has been moving right, and while Texas has been moving left, it’s still clearly more Republican than the nation as a whole. So the GOP can mostly focus on all those seats we’ve discussed and hope their incumbents just take care of business. With Democrats holding a narrow 51-49 edge in the Senate, the GOP just needs two of three from West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, assuming there aren’t surprises. And of course, there could be surprises!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Color me skeptical, and I might regret saying this come next year, but I actually don’t think that the Democrats’ Senate outlook <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/the-democrats-senate-map-of-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is that dire</a>. If Manchin runs, their chances don’t look terrible; even without him, Democrats could hang on if Republicans struggle with candidate-quality issues again. Who knows. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f937-1f3fd-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤷🏽‍♀️"></p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Inflation isn’t under control, and we’re heading for a recession. Except, wait: The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/02/03/business/jobs-report-january-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest jobs report</a> indicates that the labor market is healthier than it’s been in years. So maybe we’re heading for the fabled “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-powell-prospect-us-soft-landing-remains-alive-2023-02-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soft landing</a>” as the Federal Reserve tries to curb inflation. Except, wait: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-03/-too-good-to-be-true-jobs-report-draws-skeptics-on-data-quirks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That jobs report was <em>too</em> good</a>, which means that the Fed will hike rates even higher — and economic pain is coming.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You’re confused. We’re confused. Who <em>isn’t</em> confused? Economic signals are pointing in different directions, and with every new data release comes a new batch of headlines declaring that our odds of heading into a recession are higher or lower than they were before.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is that everyone is guessing. Let’s not forget that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-are-bad-at-predicting-recessions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economists are bad at predicting recessions</a>, and the economy is particularly weird right now. Inflation, for example, <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2022/apr/2021-year-high-inflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hadn’t been a serious issue</a> for nearly four decades — but now it’s framing the way everyone is thinking and talking about the economy. Even though it probably won’t make anyone more certain about what happens next, it’s worth trying to understand what the indicators are saying when they’re taken together. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not a clear story, and there are very different ways to present the data. Here are two possibilities for the next few months, and the evidence that does — or doesn’t — support each scenario.</p>



<h2><strong>A strong labor market — and slowing inflation — means we’re heading for a soft landing</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the most optimistic outlook for the economy in the near term, as it suggests that the Fed will continue to bring down inflation without having to accelerate rate increases and cause too much harm to the economy — particularly as it relates to the labor market — perhaps even avoiding a recession altogether. Put differently, this scenario suggests that we can have our cake and eat it, too, as far as it comes to achieving both <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/the-fed-and-the-dual-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price stability and maximum employment</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s not the view of just the sunshine-pumpers to suggest that we’re heading for a soft landing, nor is that outlook, as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/soft-landing-playing-optimism-needs-104400709.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it</a>, “at odds with both economic theory and evidence.” The latest data released, for January 2023, shows that inflation has cooled to <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=rocU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a year-over-year rate of 6.3 percent</a><a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> since its July 2022 peak of 8.9 percent, and yet the unemployment rate has stayed stubbornly low at 3.4 percent, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowest figure in more than a half-century</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Inflation has cooled down in the past few months " aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FoVZD/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="512" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Typically, when the Fed <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raises interest rates</a> to counteract inflation (or fears of it), it comes with a tradeoff: a pretty crappy economy. In the 1980s, the central bank took a markedly aggressive approach to combating inflation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/business/inflation-investing-paul-volcker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising rates to a sky-high 19 percent</a> to bring inflation down from a <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=10opV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mark of nearly 15 percent</a>. This move caused a deep — but arguably necessary — recession, and it’s an episode that has informed the thinking of not just economists and Fed officials in the decades since, but ordinary Americans as well. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="The Fed's best weapon against inflation is raising interest rates" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5zzuA/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="512" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">But one reason history might not repeat itself is a fundamental difference in the current labor market. You may recall that, prior to the pandemic, the U.S. economy was flourishing. A lot of that had to do with the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/february-2020-jobs-report-department-of-labor-213308108.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relative strength of the labor market</a>, as broad-based growth in sectors ranging from health care to construction led to a historically low unemployment rate and improving labor-force participation rate, signaling a boom. And now, it appears that we have recaptured that economy in many ways — replete with a very low unemployment rate and many, many <a href="https://www.bls.gov/jlt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job openings</a>. That’s unlike when the Fed started its ultra-aggressive approach in the late 1970s, when inflation and unemployment were significantly higher, and when the economy had been struggling through a crisis of “stagflation.” </p>


<div></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">“The labor market is so tight that it's hard to see how we can experience something like back in the ’80s,” said <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/martin/sel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fernando Martin</a>, assistant vice president in the research division at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “You're not going to see big increases in GDP growth or anything like that. But unless we start seeing indicators that the labor market starts deteriorating, it's hard to start predicting a recession in the traditional sense.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, if you hold that the recent inflation we saw was largely the byproduct of gummed-up supply chains, then there’s even further reason for optimism. Signs point to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/20/global-supply-chain-woes-have-seen-huge-improvement-flexport-founder.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supply chains</a> having improved since the height of the pandemic, which has potentially <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-quandary-can-economy-keep-motoring-inflation-fall-2023-02-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributed to easing inflation</a> and suggests that the Fed can continue bringing prices down without resorting to 1980s-style monetary engineering.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The Fed is trying to reduce aggregate demand, but with supply chains repairing at the same time, they don't need to reduce aggregate demand so sharply that we actually get rising unemployment,” said <a href="https://carolabinder.sites.haverford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carola Binder</a>, a professor of economics at Haverford College. “So I think it does seem possible to have a soft landing — and seems fairly likely, even.” </p>



<h2><strong>Inflation isn’t under control, and the labor market is too tight — so we’re probably heading for a hard landing</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s not get too happy yet, though. Several economists we spoke with cautioned that not all of the indicators are as good as they look at first glance, and a recession could still be coming.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The logic behind this is fairly simple: Although inflation seems to be ebbing, it’s not slowing as quickly as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/fed-chief-powell-says-the-the-disinflationary-process-has-begun-but-has-a-long-way-to-go.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Fed wants</a>. And that really strong labor market could be too strong for the Fed’s liking, since if workers — not jobs — are in demand, employers will be under pressure to raise wages. This could then lead to higher costs for consumers as companies try to compensate, while people also have more money to spend. To make sure that doesn’t happen, the Fed seems almost certain to continue on its rate-hiking journey, which could end up slowing down the economy too much. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Inflation has a long way to go by any measure, and I don’t see how you can get inflation down with wage growth the way it is,” said <a href="https://econ.jhu.edu/directory/jonathan-wright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Wright</a>, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University. “And given a fairly tight time horizon, I think the Fed will err on the side of doing too much.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The argument that economists like Wright are making is that yes, it’s possible for a soft landing to happen — but conditions have to stay pretty much ideal for that to become reality. And Wright said that there’s a lot of room for things to go sideways. There might not be a lot of competition for jobs, for one thing, but the share of people either working or actively looking for a job (62.4 percent in January 2023) is <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still lower than it was</a> before the pandemic (63.3 percent in February 2020). “What you’d like to see is everyone back in the labor force, but for older workers, it looks like labor-force participation may be permanently lower,” he said. To him, this means that the current trajectory of the labor market is unsustainable — and preventing high wage growth (which could drive inflation higher) will require stronger intervention from the Fed than we’ve already seen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another sign that the Fed may soon come in harder, Wright said, is that financial markets aren’t behaving as if the Fed has been consistently hiking rates for almost a year. For example, mortgage rates <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/02/homes/mortgage-rates-february-2/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell for several weeks</a> in January after <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising for most of 2022</a>. They’ve spiked again in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-mortgage-interest-rates-jump-highest-level-since-november-mba-2023-02-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past couple of weeks</a>, but it was a troubling signal for Wright, who said that generally speaking, financial conditions have been “much easier” than they should be given the Fed’s actions — and that could undercut the Fed’s work, prompting them to push for even more aggressive rate hikes in the future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recessions can also be hard to see while they’re happening — there’s a reason why the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2022/07/21/how-do-economists-determine-whether-the-economy-is-in-a-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official determination of recessions</a>, made by the National Bureau of Economic Research, is backward-looking. And there are a few clues that the economy could already be weakening. For instance, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=10otv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industrial production index</a> declined in both November and December and was flat in January, sparking <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-manufacturing-has-probably-entered-recession-kemp-2023-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation</a> that we’re already in a “manufacturing recession.” Business sales also <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=10otI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat faltered in the fall</a>, which could be another reason for pessimism.</p>


<div></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said that he thinks a soft landing is possible — it just isn’t likely, given how many things have to go right to keep the economy on track. “We could skirt [a recession], but it will take luck,” he said. That doesn’t mean, though, that we’re heading for a deep or prolonged economic decline, like the Great Recession. If a recession does happen, Sweet thinks it would be because the Fed made a “policy error” in hiking rates too aggressively. “Historically, those are mild recessions,” Sweet said. “If the unemployment rate goes up by a percentage point, that means the economy is softening and it will be uncomfortable. But the NBER might not even date it as a recession.”</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, if the COVID-19 economy has taught us anything, it’s that we shouldn’t be completely comfortable about using these indicators to make predictions. It isn’t just a feature of the pandemic, either, as economists are notorious <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-are-bad-at-predicting-recessions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for incorrectly predicting</a> when the next recession will come about. That uncertainty has washed over onto our understanding of the economy during the pandemic, as we’ve transitioned from boom, to bust, to potentially too much boom over the past 36 months. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another potential danger lies in assuming that all recessions look the same and that our not-so-trusty indicators can tell the full story, even when it appears they’ve accurately predicted our fate. Martin referred to how one key indicator of recessions that experts look to, an inverted yield curve, “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/12/31/2019s-yield-curve-inversion-means-a-recession-could-hit-in-2020/?sh=71621c214229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a>” the COVID-19 recession — but months before anyone knew of the virus’s devastating capacity. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you look at the data, well, a recession happened,” Martin said. “But you know, [the inverted yield curve] had nothing to do with anything. That was a completely unexpected shock and a cautionary tale of indicators and predictive power.”<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, we &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have another inverted yield curve now&lt;/a&gt;, which could legitimately be a warning sign for recession. And Wright told us that the current economy is a more textbook example of why that metric is potentially concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>8</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maybe the lesson is that we’re flying blind, or that our navigation of the economy can only be so precise. No matter the outcome, though, we’ll know in the coming months and years whether our economic engines have made a hard — or soft — landing on the proverbial tarmac. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It may be an odd year, but there are still elections happening — and the first notable election of 2023 took place last Tuesday, with contests in Virginia, Wisconsin and a couple of other states. The results left Democrats and liberals cheering; their preferred candidates not only won, but by larger-than-expected margins. However, Democrats shouldn’t get too giddy about what that performance means for <em>future</em> elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Arguably the marquee race of the day was the officially nonpartisan top-two primary for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Liberal-aligned Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz <a href="https://www.wpr.org/janet-protasiewicz-wisconsin-supreme-court-primary-election-results-dan-kelly-jennifer-dorow-everett-mitchell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished first</a> with 46 percent of the vote; conservative-aligned former state Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly finished second with 24 percent of the vote. Protasiewicz and Kelly will now face off in an April 4 general election that will decide control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court (not counting this open seat, there are currently <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sQh7uU7IUolRMASXc0eUZuavXzfdTWnOWjx7VMuw500/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three conservative justices and three liberal justices</a> on the court). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelly was the opponent liberals wanted in this race: The liberal outside group A Better Wisconsin Together spent nearly <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/Public/Registration.aspx?page=FiledReports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.2 million</a> opposing Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Jennifer Dorow, another conservative candidate considered to have more general-election appeal. (Kelly, by contrast, has some <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/blogs/proof-and-hearsay/2017/02/01/carroll-students-oppose-justice-kelly-appearance/97338082/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial views</a> and lost a previous state Supreme Court election by more than 10 percentage points.) And many liberals are also feeling good about their chances in April given the vote totals from the primary. Together, Kelly and Dorow pulled 46 percent of the vote on Tuesday, while Protasiewicz and another liberal-aligned candidate combined for 54 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An 8-point advantage for the liberal bloc in a state as divided as Wisconsin is an impressive performance — but it probably doesn’t mean anything for the general election. Since 2008, when Wisconsin’s nominally nonpartisan Supreme Court elections became <a href="https://www.wpr.org/contentious-supreme-court-race-stage-was-set-decade-ago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">de facto partisan contests</a>, there has been little relationship between the combined liberal-conservative margin in the primary and the liberal-conservative margin in the general.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">An optimistic liberal might see that the margin has gotten better for liberals in four of the five elections in which there was a contested primary. However, that’s still a fairly small sample size, and the examples we have show that huge swings between the primary and general are not uncommon. On average, general-election margins in Wisconsin Supreme Court elections differ from primary margins by almost 11 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The news is better for Democrats in Virginia, where Tuesday saw a special election for the state’s 4th Congressional District. Democratic state Sen. Jennifer McClellan’s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/mcclellan-beats-benjamin-in-special-election-for-virginia-congressional-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeat</a> of Republican pastor Leon Benjamin was no surprise given the district’s <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/partisan-lean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean. Partisan leans have not yet been updated with the results of the 2022 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> of D+29. But it was a surprise just <em>how much</em> she won by: <a href="https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2023%20February%20Special/Site/Congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost 49 points</a>, a 19-point Democratic overperformance.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s 19 points and not 20 because McClellan actually won by 48.54 points, and the district’s partisan lean is D+29.15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> McClellan even carried rural Dinwiddie County, which voted for former President Donald Trump by 16 points in 2020 and hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZmDRzvm83BYurKX7LsrET-C7tcIsE5Em42Wt-gTydXk/edit#gid=597115357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1996</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-special-election-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-are-overperforming-in-special-elections-almost-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-foreshadowed-a-blue-wave-in-2018-what-are-they-saying-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">times</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-special-elections-can-tell-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-can-special-elections-so-far-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight</a>, special elections can be predictive of the national political environment in the next regularly scheduled election, so this shellacking was a good sign for Democrats. But as we’ve written just as many times, one special election doesn’t mean anything on its own. Local factors like candidate quality might explain McClellan’s overperformance more than systemic national trends. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why it’s notable that Democrats <em>also</em> punched above their weight in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vf9-VFavJ3lyYsSrKX1ECuP5DyVlegDtG-UJLpQvh7s/edit#gid=298079716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other, lower-profile special elections</a> that have occurred this month. On Tuesday, Democrats scored a 54-point victory in a special election in a Kentucky state Senate district that President Biden carried by 31 points, according to <a href="https://cnalysis.com/maps/2020-presidential-by-2020s-legislative-districts-and-most-recent-result/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNalysis</a>. In addition, they won a New Hampshire state House district by 11 points after the two parties achieved a <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/recount-new-hampshire-house-tie-111622/41982623#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfect tie</a> (970 votes to 970 votes) in the 2022 election, necessitating a re-vote. And on Feb. 7, Democrats overperformed FiveThirtyEight partisan lean by an average of 29 points in a trio of Pennsylvania state House races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taken together, those are encouraging signs for Democrats — but they’re also still just a handful of races in a short period of time. For example, a series of special state-legislative elections in Georgia and Virginia in January showed no such Democratic overperformance. Plus, it’s still early in the 2024 cycle; the Dobbs decision last summer showed how the national mood can <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change on a dime</a>. We’ll need a longer track record of special elections before we can say that we’re in a lasting pro-Democratic political environment.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Before you ask: ChatGPT did not write this article. I will admit that I did <em>ask</em> the AI chatbot to write an 800-word article in FiveThirtyEight’s style about current public opinion on AI chatbots like ChatGPT, but our collaboration disintegrated amid editorial differences. (If you’re curious what ChatGPT had to say, though, you can read its take at the bottom of the page.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Apart from committing the cardinal sin of failing to produce polling numbers until the sixth paragraph, ChatGPT’s take on how Americans see it and other chatbots was suspiciously positive. “A 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Americans believe it is generally a good thing for society if robots and computers become more capable and sophisticated, while only 27% believe this would be a bad thing,” ChatGPT wrote. “This suggests that people are increasingly open to the idea of AI and see it as a potential source of innovation and progress.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You should only abandon FiveThirtyEight for chatbot journalism if you don’t mind some made-up data. I was unable to find the 2021 Pew survey that ChatGPT was referencing, and when I reached out, Pew’s media team was similarly stumped about where the question came from. (ChatGPT’s tendency to make up facts is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-may-make-up-facts-openai-cto-mira-murati-says-2023-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a “core challenge” for the technology</a>, according to its chief technology officer.)<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT included one other “survey” in the story it wrote for me: “According to a 2021 survey by PwC, 49% of consumers say they are comfortable with AI chatbots handling their customer service inquiries, and 59% say they have used a chatbot for customer service in the past year.” This survey also eluded our attempts to find it online, and when we asked PwC whether it’s a real finding, they said “those stats were not within PwC&amp;#8217;s 2022 AI Business Survey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> In fact, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/03/17/ai-and-human-enhancement-americans-openness-is-tempered-by-a-range-of-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2021 Pew survey</a> on the topic that I did unearth suggested the opposite. When asked about the increased use of artificial intelligence in daily life, only 18 percent of respondents said they were more excited than concerned, while 37 percent said they were more concerned than excited and 45 percent said they were equally concerned and excited. This is consistent with what recent polls actually show: Americans generally don’t trust AI — particularly in high-stakes situations, like medical care — and they’re fearful that AI-powered search engines could be inaccurate and biased.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lest you think I am being too harsh on a technology that’s still in its infancy — it’s not all bad news for ChatGPT. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2023/02/22/generative-ai-fans-public-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Morning Consult poll conducted Feb. 11-13</a> found that a majority (52 percent) of Americans think that generative AI platforms like chatbots are not a fad, and majorities of workers in health care, design, engineering and finance/accounting said that their industry has more to gain from use of generative AI tools than to lose.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s safe to say that AI has a lot of trust to build. According to Morning Consult, only 10 percent of Americans think the output from generative AI is “very trustworthy,” while 11 percent think it is “not at all trustworthy,” and the remaining 80 percent are undecided. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/22/60-of-americans-would-be-uncomfortable-with-provider-relying-on-ai-in-their-own-health-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another Pew survey</a> conducted from Dec. 12-18 found that 60 percent of Americans would be uncomfortable if their own health care provider relied on artificial intelligence for their medical care, and 75 percent said they were more concerned that health care providers will move too quickly with this technology, before fully understanding the risks to patients. And speaking of my own profession, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_021523/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Monmouth University poll</a> conducted Jan. 26-30 found that while 72 percent of Americans believe that there will be a time when entire news articles are written by AI, 78 percent of Americans think this would be a bad thing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s in part because concerns about misinformation, bias and accuracy are fairly widespread. When asked last week by <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2023/02/22/ai-powered-search-concerns-bing-chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> about search engines that rely on AI, roughly two-thirds of adults said they were worried about misinformation, 63 percent said they had at least some concern about accuracy and 62 percent said they were concerned about biased search results. And AI applications like chatbots are sparking more dystopian fears too. According to the survey, 63 percent of adults worry that AI will cause harmful behavior, and a similar share are concerned that AI applications could “learn to function independently from humans.” Those fears seem to be growing: The Monmouth University survey found that 55 percent of Americans now believe that artificial intelligence could pose a risk to the existence of the human race, up from 44 percent in 2015.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what do Americans think AI is good for? Recipes, roadside assistance and coal mining, according to Morning Consult and Monmouth. The two pollsters approached the question in different ways: <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2023/02/22/generative-ai-recipes-roadside-assistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult’s Feb. 17-19 survey</a> asked respondents if they were “very” or “somewhat” interested in a number of AI-related products and services. AI-powered online search, AI-generated recipes, and AI-powered roadside assistance topped the list, although 43 percent of respondents were “very” or “somewhat” interested in AI tools for police or criminal justice — a use for AI with considerably higher stakes than search accuracy. Monmouth, meanwhile, asked about six potential applications of artificial intelligence and found that respondents were only broadly OK letting AI take on risky jobs like coal mining (75 percent), compared to facial recognition at public places (54 percent), nuclear power plant safety operations (38 percent), or military drone decision-making (34 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s one thing to send a robot <a href="https://eos.org/features/underground-robots-how-robotics-is-changing-the-mining-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down a coal mine</a>. But we’ll see how enthusiastic Americans are about AI-generated recipes when ChatGPT’s culinary equivalent sneaks some horseradish into an apple pie. Based on early forays into AI-fueled recipe generation, <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/apps/a19304/computer-generated-recipes-are-gut-bustlingly-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that might be a best-case scenario</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Ahead of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/us/politics/biden-kyiv-ukraine.html">President Biden made a surprise visit</a> to Kyiv on Monday to show American support for the beleaguered country. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2023/02/22/cc050/2">A YouGov poll conducted on Feb. 22</a> found that a slim majority of Americans (51 percent) at least somewhat approve of Biden’s visit. An additional 17 percent neither approve nor disapprove, 22 percent at least somewhat disapprove and 10 percent weren’t sure. This reflects the broader state of public opinion about American support for Ukraine, according to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2023/02/22/49509/3">another YouGov poll conducted on Feb. 22</a>: Slightly less than half (46 percent) of Americans say they want the U.S. to “support Ukraine in its efforts against Russia” until Russia withdraws, even if that makes the war last longer, while 24 percent want the U.S. to “encourage a negotiated peace to end the fighting” even if that results in more Russian control within Ukraine, and an additional 30 percent said they wanted neither option or didn’t know.</li><li><a href="https://www.prri.org/research/abortion-attitudes-in-a-post-roe-world-findings-from-the-50-state-2022-american-values-atlas/">A new survey from Public Religion Research Institute</a> found that the share of Americans who think abortion should be legal in all or most cases has grown since the organization began asking the question, from 55 percent in 2010 to 64 percent today. There’s been even more movement among Democrats: Today, 87 percent of Democrats think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from 71 percent in 2010. However, there have not been major shifts on the issue since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. The survey, which also looked at views on abortion legality by state, found that there are only seven states where less than half the population thinks abortion should be legal in all or most cases.</li><li>Most Americans don’t think the country is equipped to handle another pandemic. <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/axios-ipsos-american-health-index">A new Axios-Ipsos survey</a> on public health found that only 28 percent of Americans believe the country is “adequately prepared” for another pandemic, and 75 percent of Americans don’t think that American businesses or the government prioritize Americans’ health or well-being. That being said, at least 75 percent of Americans said their personal health is “good” on a range of metrics — but when probed, much smaller shares said they’re fully satisfied with their physical health, diet and personal finances.</li><li>Just compromise, already! That’s what <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-118th-congress/">a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist National Poll</a> wants government officials in Washington to do: According to the poll, 70 percent of Americans think it’s more important for politicians to compromise, while 28 percent think it’s more important to stand on principle. However, on the specific issue where compromise is eluding Congress currently, Americans are more divided. Just about half (52 percent) of registered voters support raising the federal debt ceiling. This is, however, a much higher level of support than the pollster found during another debt ceiling showdown in April 2011, when only 24 percent wanted to raise the federal debt ceiling.</li></ul>

I asked <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/curtis-yee/">my copy editor</a> to edit the following output from ChatGPT. He flagged issues of <span>factual error</span>, <span>style and grammar</span>, <span>voice and tone</span>, and <span>unsubstantiated claims</span>. The resulting piece, with his comments, is below.<br><br>
</div>

<div>
<p><span><span>Artificial intelligence chatbots have become increasingly popular in recent years, with more and more companies and individuals using them to automate their customer service, provide personalized recommendations, and even hold human-like conversations.</span><a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reads like the intro to a press release that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t read.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a><span> ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI, is one such chatbot that has garnered significant attention and praise for its ability to understand and generate <span>natural</span><a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d argue it&amp;#8217;s “semi-natural.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a><span> language. However, despite its many <span>impressive capabilities,</span><a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this is necessarily inaccurate, but it&amp;#8217;s self-congratulatory — and probably a journalistic conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a><span> public opinion on AI chatbots like ChatGPT is mixed.</span><br><br><span>On one hand, there are those who view AI chatbots as <span>a valuable tool that can improve efficiency and productivity</span><a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact echo of a phrase used in the last paragraph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a><span> in a variety of industries. For example, businesses can use chatbots to automate routine tasks like answering frequently asked questions, scheduling appointments, and processing payments, freeing up <span>human employees</span><a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies there are &amp;#8230; non-human employees?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a><span> to focus on more complex tasks. In addition, chatbots can provide 24/7 support to customers, reducing the need for human staff to work long or irregular hours. </span><br><br><span>Furthermore, some people appreciate the convenience and personalization that chatbots can provide. Chatbots can use natural language processing to understand and respond to customer inquiries in real-time, allowing them to receive instant feedback and support. <span>They</span><a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unclear pronoun attribution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a><span> can also use machine learning algorithms to personalize their responses based on previous interactions with the user, making the experience feel more human-like and tailored to the individual. </span><br><br><span>On the other hand, there are those who are skeptical of AI chatbots and worry about their potential negative consequences. One concern is that chatbots could replace human workers, leading to job loss and <span>economic inequality.</span><a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know that this is an accurate characterization of &amp;#8220;economic inequality.&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a><span> For example, if a company replaces its customer service representatives with chatbots, those employees would be out of work, and the company would save money by not having to pay their salaries and <span>benefits.</span><a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implies without evidence that those workers are receiving benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a><span> This could exacerbate existing economic inequalities, as lower-skilled workers are more likely to be replaced by automation than those with more specialized skills. </span><br><br><span> <span>Another concern is that chatbots may not be able to handle complex or sensitive situations as well as humans.</span><a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably an understatement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a><span> While AI chatbots are trained to respond to a wide range of questions and scenarios, there are limits to their abilities. <span>They may struggle with nuance, cultural differences, and emotional intelligence, which could lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications. Additionally, some users may be uncomfortable with the idea of sharing personal information or discussing sensitive topics with a machine rather than a human.</span><a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguments are made without any sourcing or backup information to validate the line of thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a><span> </span><br><br><span><span>Despite these concerns, the overall public opinion on AI chatbots seems to be generally positive.</span><a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This framing reads more like a persuasive essay rather than a work of journalism. The focus is not on explaining how Americans &lt;strong&gt;feel&lt;/strong&gt; about AI chatbots, but rather making a case that Americans are supportive of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a>
<span><span> According to a 2021 survey by PwC, 49% of consumers say they are comfortable with AI chatbots handling their customer service inquiries, and 59% say they have used a chatbot for customer service in the past year.</span><a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This poll isn&amp;#8217;t real. Also, the framing of this paragraph conflates the alleged comfort Americans feel about using AI chatbots to perform simple tasks with the anxieties around nuance and miscommunications mentioned in the paragraph above. In a way, ChatGPT is proving its own point — though probably not in the way it wants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a><span> <span>This suggests that</span> many people are already familiar with chatbots and see them as a viable option for getting support and information. </span><br><br><span>Furthermore, there is evidence that people are becoming more accepting of AI in general. <span>A 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Americans believe it is generally a good thing for society if robots and computers become more capable and sophisticated, while only 27% believe this would be a bad thing.</span><a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This poll is also not real. Plus, our style is to write out &amp;#8220;percent&amp;#8221; rather than using the percent sign. (Yes, we will sometimes buck the standards of the Associated Press.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a><span> <span>This suggests that</span><a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact echo of the concluding sentence of the previous paragraph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a>
<span> people are increasingly open to the idea of AI and see it as a potential source of innovation and progress. </span><br><br><span><span>However, public opinion on AI chatbots may vary depending on the specific use case and industry.</span><a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is speculation and is not backed up by any sourcing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a><span> For example, a chatbot designed to provide personalized shopping recommendations may be more well-received than a chatbot designed to provide medical advice or mental health support. In addition, the age, gender, and educational background of the user may also impact their perception of chatbots and their willingness to interact with them. </span><br><br><span>In conclusion, public opinion on AI chatbots like ChatGPT is mixed, with some people viewing them as <span>a valuable tool for improving efficiency and productivity,</span><a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact echo of a phrase used in the second paragraph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a><span> while others worry about their potential negative consequences.

<p data-paragraph="main">House Democrats <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/house-speaker-leadership-vote-01-06-23/h_a8cd59e06b4e4ac11a64cbf4257e02f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially elected</a> New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to be their leader this past weekend, coalescing around a fresher face as the new Republican majority took control. The new top three leaders will consist of Jeffries, Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, who will serve as the new minority whip, and California Rep. Pete Aguilar, who will chair the Democratic caucus. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While all of these changes are noteworthy, Jeffries, in particular, makes history as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/04/politics/hakeem-jeffries-history-first-black-party-leader/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Black politician</a> to lead any major party in Congress. At 52, he also marks a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/18/democrats-generation-pelosi-jeffries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stark generational shift</a> for House Democratic leadership <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/17/i-feel-balanced-about-it-all-nancy-pelosi-reflects-two-decades-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following two decades</a> under Nancy Pelosi, who is leaving the position at 82 years old. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This switch-up is a big deal. For the first time ever, the top tier of a major party’s House congressional leadership side is <a href="https://time.com/6237571/house-democrats-leadership-no-white-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devoid of white men</a>. But changes of the guard, no matter how historic, don’t always lead to big practical changes, and I’m skeptical whether this power shift will shepherd a new direction for the Democratic Party — either in the form of a new focus on the progressive policies that younger voters care about, or the issues that Black voters prioritize. One big difference from the end of Pelosi’s reign, of course, is that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-control-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats have lost control</a> of the chamber, so Jeffries is coming in with much less power than his predecessor held <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidents-Coinciding/Party-Government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the past several years</a>. His primary responsibility will be marshaling unified opposition among an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-six-wings-of-the-democratic-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideologically diverse caucus</a> since there’s not a ton he’ll be able to do legislatively. But, even then, Jeffries still has a choice to make: Will he use his new mantle to advocate for more progressive policies or continue the unspoken tradition of past rising Black political leaders and move more <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/30/hakeem-jeffries-house-democrats-elected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toward the middle</a>?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The evidence I’ve gathered so far suggests that we shouldn’t expect a big pivot for the party under Jeffries. Yes, he <a href="https://www.essence.com/news/congressman-hakeem-jeffries-reintroduces-legislation-to-criminalize-police-chokeholds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has previously</a> advocated for the passage of more racially progressive policies and that’s likely to continue given the Democratic Party’s embrace of these issues. But, overall, his rather <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/who-is-hakeem-jeffries-the-first-black-house-leader-in-us-history-8361577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional political resume</a> (including his start as a lawyer, stint in New York’s state Assembly and now <a href="https://jeffries.house.gov/2013/08/09/jeffries-is-in-the-house-binghamtons-first-alumnus-elected-to-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 years in Congress</a>) and his sometimes-antagonistic relationship <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/18/ocasio-cortez-hakeem-jeffries-2020-primary-1067107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with members on his left flank</a> suggests that his leadership will be more in the mold of Pelosi, whose true <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pelosi-Molly-Ball/dp/1250252865?ots=1&amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvx%5Bp%5D21012035%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics are a bit of an enigma</a>, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-progressive-left-fits-so-uncomfortably-within-the-democratic-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is largely grouped</a> with the party’s establishment wing by Democratic voters. That’s probably not a coincidence. In fact, I’ll go as far as to argue that America’s political structure primarily rewards a certain kind of Black leader: one who is constrained — if not less apt — to push beyond the status quo. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Various <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/002193479602700202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies and research show that</a> Black people who are the “firsts” in leadership roles often get there <em>because </em>of their <a href="https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/washington-booker-t-1856-1915-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facility for accommodation</a> or because there’s an understanding that they’ll <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/booker-t-washington-and-atlanta-compromise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work under the system they’re in</a> rather than try to transform it. There’s evidence, too, that Black leaders <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/30/hakeem-jeffries-house-democrats-elected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can become more moderate</a> once in positions of power or even “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/abs/hamiltons-deracialization/51C4985275E0BAFBC2F8A24E05B419D3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deracialized</a>,” meaning they downplay their racial identity in favor of more race-neutral policies. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t mean Jeffries will ignore the issue of race — both because Jeffries has shown he cares about these issues and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ideas-that-are-reshaping-the-democratic-party-and-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking about race is now en vogue on the left</a>. Indeed, given the party’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ideas-that-are-reshaping-the-democratic-party-and-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standing on issues dealing with race</a> and racism, especially following the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-has-and-hasnt-changed-since-george-floyd-was-murdered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">murder of George Floyd in 2020</a>, Jeffries may find it <em>easier</em> to talk about racial issues more broadly. But as Jeffries ascends into leadership, there is a caveat: Appearing <em>too</em> progressive on race-specific policies is politically risky. According to <a href="https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/users/christopher-stout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Stout</a>, an Oregon State University professor and author of a 2015 book on Black politicians, one of the unspoken institutional constraints of even being considered for a leadership role is that politicians often have to moderate their views — particularly on issues dealing with race — for fear of alienating certain (oftentimes white) voters. Stout added that members of Congress, and particularly those in leadership positions, are oftentimes wary of potential Black leadership so, “at least early on, [Black leaders] have to demonstrate that they’re not different from the other leadership that people are used to.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jeffries has attempted to toe that line throughout the years, too, taking <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/hakeem-jeffries-nancy-pelosi-speaker-house/619695/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain progressive stances</a> while simultaneously distancing himself from that side of the party. For instance, he’s served as a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and <a href="https://www.insider.com/hakeem-jeffries-pelosi-democratic-house-leader-history-progressive-racial-justice-2022-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted issues</a> like addressing police brutality, but did not sign on to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/12/07/hakeem-jeffries-green-new-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Green New Deal</a>. And while <a href="https://voteview.com/person/21343/hakeem-jeffries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s more liberal</a> than most fellow House members, according to DW-NOMINATE, a political-science metric that uses roll-call votes to measure the ideology of members of Congress, Jeffries <a href="https://twitter.com/isaacdovere/status/1593304674643460103" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tried to assert his independence</a> from the party’s left wing, saying in 2021, “There will never be a moment where I bend the knee to hard-left democratic socialism.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that his position could shift as time goes on. As the visualization above shows, the Black leaders in the last Congress, at least according to their legislative records in the last session, were more politically moderate and closely linked to the establishment, and it’s likely that Jeffries will move in their direction.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newly elected members of Congress don’t have DW-NOMINATE scores yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> Moderating his politics would arguably make his job easier because he’d be able to reach more members of his caucus. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And according to <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/kt10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Tate</a>, a political science professor at Brown University, that doesn’t necessarily mean he’d have to cut back on representing Black voters, whose interests are nearly identical to that of the party’s, in part, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-catch-22-facing-black-voters-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given their “captured” status</a>. And, to be clear, Jeffries’s legislative record shows that his priorities <em>have</em> been on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/57-percent-americans-believe-voting-is-a-fundamental-right-pew-2021-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issues important to</a> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2022/08/30/black-americans-are-pessimistic-about-their-position-in-u-s-society/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black voters in particular</a>, such as <a href="https://www.insider.com/hakeem-jeffries-pelosi-democratic-house-leader-history-progressive-racial-justice-2022-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting rights and addressing police brutality</a>.<strong> </strong>So it’s possible that he continues working in that same vein while in leadership. It’s also possible that unlike just ten or fifteen years ago, when <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sZz3AwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT6&amp;dq=obama+deracialization&amp;ots=ztNycUnEGF&amp;sig=gyY27IF-WkPH4CE4iUInSj4N04U#v=onepage&amp;q=obama%20deracialization&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some scholars contend</a> that <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230370456_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Barack Obama</a> <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1057/pol.2012.25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used universal rhetoric</a> to advance his agenda to keep from alienating racially conservative white voters, Jeffries might actually have an easier<em> </em>time discussing issues of race because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/02/opinion/democrat-party-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mainstream Democratic messaging</a> is more in-line with the priorities of Black voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://gvpt.umd.edu/facultyprofile/laird/chryl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chryl Laird</a>, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland College Park who has contributed to FiveThirtyEight, predicted that we may see Jeffries tackle issues related to race. “It may be less than he did in the past, but I don’t think there will be a complete disregard for issues dealing with race because doing that doesn’t necessarily help the Democratic Party,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The trouble is that there’s a Catch-22 in pushing for policies that have Black support. Despite gains in participation and representation, Black Americans continue to fare worse than whites in converting policy preferences into law. One <a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=284123064090004013103086114105100065040086057015091007085094113078113064011004087069106114044017059048002098028121124096016081060078047087052018070004085120098107002000062025031082066124084002113099068015114075019102125118115093091090086066084024031&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 study</a><strong> </strong>found that federal policies with no white support had only about a 10 percent chance of getting enacted versus one with universal white support which had around a whopping 60 percent chance of adoption. On the flip side, a proposal with no Black support had a roughly 40 percent chance of becoming law, while one with unanimous Black approval had only around a 30 percent chance of enactment. In other words, as more Black people begin to support a policy, the chance of that policy being achieved actually <em>declines</em>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So Jeffries has his work cut out for him. A cynic (like myself) might even say that this change of the guard is mostly cosmetic. While I’m willing to be proven wrong, radical change is hard for any “first” to deliver, especially considering the fact that the older group of former leaders is still in Congress and very much dominates the operational fabric of the Democratic Party. That said, I’ll wait to see what Jeffries actually does before pooh-poohing his new role. What constitutes “progress” means different things to many people. At the very least, I’d expect him to continue his work on issues important to Black communities. That might not be the radical change some Democrats are looking for. But it still matters. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">I’m not happy about it, and you’re not happy about it, but it’s time to talk about <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls of the 2024 Republican presidential primary</a>. We’re still (<a href="https://www.frontloadinghq.com/p/the-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably</a>) more than a year away from the Iowa caucuses, yet pollsters have already asked about the Republican primary at least 96 times since the 2022 midterm elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yes, it’s still very early to be looking at these polls, and yes, a lot can change in the next 12 months. But we <em>are</em> now in the period where 2024 polls are at least somewhat interesting. As FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has written</a>, national polls conducted in the calendar year before the election are fairly predictive of who will eventually win the nomination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Or they would be … if this cycle’s polls weren’t all over the place. Some, like <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult’s tracking poll</a>, give former President Donald Trump a wide lead. Others, like <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/c5o6xiw8t9/econtoplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a December survey from YouGov/The Economist</a>, show Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis far ahead, despite the fact that he has not yet officially launched a campaign. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a reason the polls disagree so much: They’re asking about different campaigns. Some surveys are asking about a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and DeSantis, while others are asking about a multiway battle royal among several Republicans. In one of these scenarios, DeSantis is the favorite; in the other, it’s Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When pollsters ask about a two-person race between DeSantis and Trump, DeSantis is usually ahead. A simple average of head-to-head national polls taken since the midterms<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using just the most recent poll conducted by each pollster/sponsor combination, so that particularly prolific pollsters don’t skew the average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> puts DeSantis at 48 percent and Trump at 43 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Some of the discrepancy could also be due to differences in the polls’ <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickRuffini/status/1602672137676161024?s=20&amp;t=zD-OgGZymStk15OxFY1J4Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">methodologies and turnout models</a>. (For example, are they polling just registered Republicans, or Republican-leaning independents, too?) But this pattern was evident (albeit to a smaller degree) even when the same pollster asked about both a head-to-head and multiway race in the same poll. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Some of these polls will turn out to be wrong, seeing as we don’t even know who’s running for president yet. But unfortunately for us, we don’t yet know which field is the correct one. Plenty of Republicans other than DeSantis and Trump have hinted they might run for president too, including former Ambassador to the United Nations <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nikki-haley-says-will-decide-2024-presidential-run-over-holidays" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki Haley</a>, Maryland Gov. <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/larry-hogan-new-hampshire-politics-eggs-2022/41542962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larry Hogan</a>, former Vice President <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/20/mike-pence-trump-president-2024-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Pence</a> and former Secretary of State <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pompeo-presidential-election-2024-announcement-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Pompeo</a>. But for now, they’re all polling in the single digits, and even if they do jump into the race, it’s very possible that they will drop out before voters actually start voting early next year — leaving us with a race that boils down to just DeSantis and Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But these polls do give us one valuable piece of information, one that’s right under our nose: Trump seems to have a better chance at recapturing the nomination in a multiway race. This makes intuitive sense, too. So far, the 2024 Republican primary seems to be shaping up as a battle between Trump and the not-Trumps; notice how, in our polling averages, Trump’s support was very similar in both head-to-head (43 percent) and multiway (41 percent) matchups, but DeSantis lost a lot more support to other candidates (going from 48 percent to 31 percent). As those numbers suggest, if anti-Trump voters coalesce behind one alternative, it seems there are enough of them to defeat him. But if opposition to Trump is divided among multiple candidates, he could easily finish in first place with a simple plurality. And, because most states allocate all or most of their Republican National Convention delegates to the winner of their primary or caucus rather than splitting them up proportionally, that’s a recipe for Trump to lock up the nomination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is essentially what happened in 2016, when Trump was still a deeply controversial figure within the Republican primary; opponents like Sen. Ted Cruz, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush all fought on thinking they could beat him, with the result that no one did. The same thing could happen in 2024; what remains to be seen is whether Republican elites will let it.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, internal Republican Party divisions spilled onto the floor of the House of Representatives in a way rarely publicly seen in Washington. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew looks at why it took 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy elected House Speaker and what that process says about the two years ahead and the GOP more broadly. They also consider how Rep. George Santos’s scandals will affect his tenure in Congress and whether he would have been elected at all if his fabricated biography had received more scrutiny during the campaign.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Cleveland is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewdepietro/2021/11/26/us-poverty-rate-by-city-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the poorest cities</a> in the country. It’s far from the expensive coastal cities like New York City and San Francisco, where astronomically high rents are common. Cleveland doesn’t fit the stereotype of a city people want to move to; in fact, it has been <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/11/5-cities-have-lost-half-or-more-of-their-populations-since-1950/39557461/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing population since the 1950s</a>. But since 2020, there have been some wild fluctuations in the rental market. Even in many cities that had previously been affordable, rents keep getting higher, stretching more families’ budgets and spreading a largely coastal problem to nearly every part of the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Rents increased sharply in 2021 but are relaxing slightly" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/39B6s/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="550" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even as the pandemic moves into a maintenance phase, Cleveland families are still getting sick, still struggling financially and still seeking help to find affordable housing and to pay their rents, said Julie Wisneski, director of the housing stability program at the United Way of Greater Cleveland. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most of her organization’s clients struggle to get by on low incomes, she said. When they can find places with rent that they can technically afford, those properties are usually in rough shape. “There’s lead paint, there’s broken windows, there’s broken … stairs, there’s plumbing issues,” she said. For Wisneski’s clients, being able to pay rent doesn’t do much good if the apartment is not a safe place to live. “The lack of affordable housing is so bad in Cleveland right now,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While rents for new leases measured by Zillow and other apartment listing sites finally <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/15/us-rents-drop-at-the-fastest-rate-in-7-years-per-zillow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began dropping</a> nationwide at the end of 2022, the dip came only after a year of historic, nationwide rent increases throughout 2021. (<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUUR0000SEHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Consumer Price Index</a>, which surveys a sample of landlords and renters and includes renewals, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/14/rents-apartments-decline-cpi-price-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t shown a drop yet</a>.) The effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns, intercity moves made at the beginning of the work-from-home era and record-high inflation made the long-standing problem of increasing rents all the worse. Today, rents remain much higher in many cities than they were before the pandemic, even in some cities that had previously been more affordable. Now, with the economy poised on the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/23/why-everyone-thinks-a-recession-is-coming-in-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edge of a recession</a>, the programs <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established during the pandemic</a> to help <a href="https://www.clarkcountynv.gov/news_detail_T28_R837.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">families</a> <a href="https://www.kold.com/2022/12/13/pima-county-rental-assistance-program-during-pandemic-set-end-february/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afford</a> <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/11/federal-rental-assistance-expiring-next-month-expected-to-tally-108m-in-cuyahoga-county-since-start-of-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">housing</a> <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2022/12/21/midcoast-braces-for-end-of-federal-rental-assistance-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/12/10/denver-emergency-rental-assistance-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expiring</a>. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In the years leading up to the pandemic, rents steadily increased nationwide by an average of about 4 percent year-over-year, according to Zillow data of the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas going back to 2015.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/methodology-zori-repeat-rent-27092/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Zillow Observed Rent Index&lt;/a&gt; (ZORI) is a metric for measuring the changes in asking rents of the same rental unit over time, which helps account for some of the differences in quality among available rental units. ZORI data was excluded if there was insufficient rental data or there was too much noise leading to unreliable calculations. Additionally, several metropolitan areas had at least one month of missing data, including New York, Boston and San Francisco in August and September 2020. The dollar value is adjusted to match the value of the dollar for the corresponding month. The 100 largest metropolitan areas are ranked according to population on the 2010 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a> It is worth mentioning, though, that while Zillow’s rent index is a frequently used metric for measuring changes in rent, data sets from apartment listing websites are <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/rents-are-too-high-here-are-three-ways-get-data-we-need-fix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a perfect reflection of renters’ on-the-ground experiences</a>, and companies like Zillow aren’t neutral observers of the rental market. Rent indexes by Zillow and others can differ greatly, largely because of rent inflation among new tenants instead of among renewing tenants, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/2022/pdf/ec220100.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as described in this working paper</a> by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That being said, the broad trends captured by Zillow’s index are <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly</a> in <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/september-2022-rent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">line</a> with <a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2021/08/rents-still-rising-with-regional-riffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other data sets</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At that pre-pandemic pace, rents had already been <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research-areas/working-papers/documenting-long-run-decline-low-cost-rental-units-us-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becoming more unaffordable for average families for decades</a>. Then came COVID-19. At first, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/05/rents-are-falling-due-to-covid-heres-how-to-negotiate-a-lower-rate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rents fell in many cities</a> because people stayed home and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/08/17/apartments-rent-landlords-offer-lease-deals-discounts-amid-covid/3316895001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed moves</a> they might otherwise have made. But after the initial shocks wore off, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-remarkable-recent-rebound-in-household-formation-and-the-prospects-for-future-housing-demand-20220506.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobility skyrocketed</a>. People who’d delayed moves the previous year packed their bags, as did people who divorced or split from roommates they were sick of, young people who’d delayed leaving their parents’ homes and people who left expensive cities to get more space for less money elsewhere.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The pandemic “greatly increased the importance of home,” said Chris Herbert, managing director for the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. “For everyone who was living, working, studying from home, and much of your social life was home, the value of having a place to gather was that much more important.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This trend hit some regions harder than others. Cities in the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mountain West</a>, like Boise, Idaho, and Las Vegas, as well as those in the Sun Belt, like in Florida, saw huge rent spikes. Through summer 2021, rents in Boise and Las Vegas were roughly 20 percent to 26 percent higher than at the same points the previous year. Cape Coral, Florida, saw year-over-year rents swell 33 percent this past January, after months of climbing. And at the end of August 2021, Allentown, Pennsylvania, saw rent prices nearly 18 percent higher than 12 months earlier. Now some of these cities are seeing the biggest slowdowns in the rate of rent increases.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Florida has long been a popular state to move to, but that trend was amplified during the pandemic. In many cities in Florida, rents over the summer of 2021 increased by 20 to 30 percent over what they’d been at the same point in the previous year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The vacation-home market also boomed, pushing rents up in smaller resort communities, like <a href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/2022/11/27/yarmouth-planning-board-looks-to-fix-extra-apartment-bylaw/69670810007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cape Cod, Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/americas-ski-towns-jam-packed-season-heres-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">towns near ski resorts in Western states</a>. Rents increased too much for low-wage workers and seasonal workers in those areas to afford. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in cities like Cleveland, the rent increases swelled later. While they never reached the same heights as some of the biggest boom cities in 2021, their rises have lasted longer and are generally increasing less rapidly now. Toward the end of 2022, the year-over-year rent increases weren’t as high as earlier in the year: Rents in Louisville, Kentucky, still increased by 11.2 percent in November 2022, compared with 12 months earlier — a modest 0.1 percent less than during the previous month. Year-over-year rents in November also increased by 10.6 percent in Kansas City, Missouri, which was 0.3 percent less than in October; and they increased by 8.3 percent in Cleveland, which was 0.7 percent less.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Rent soared in some areas, even in those deemed affordable" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OnqRj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="550" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">It makes sense that some of these cities are not seeing rents fall as quickly, said Rob Warnock, a senior research associate at Apartment List, an online marketplace for listing apartments. “It didn't experience the same dramatic run increases that like Florida did, and so now it's the last part of the country that people are looking toward when they feel like they can go somewhere and get a deal.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The price increases in the indexes used by companies like Zillow and Apartment List are for new rental agreements, which means that the increases they capture <a href="https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/2022/pdf/ec220100.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit new tenants harder</a>. But they can impact existing tenants, too, by affecting their negotiating power with the current landlords or limiting their ability to move from a bad or unsuitable apartment, like the conditions Wisneski described. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These forces push the people struggling with very low-incomes into more and more marginal areas, said Josiah Quarles, the director of organizing and advocacy for the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless. Quarles works to organize tenant groups in Cleveland and says he’s had to stop working in some buildings because he believes they’re unsafe for tenants and his organizers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The rental data from Zillow doesn’t capture such complexities, and it can make rents seem more affordable than they truly are.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of the trends now affecting Quarles’s clients began during the housing crisis and the Great Recession, and then accelerated during the pandemic, he said. As he put it, investors would buy cheap housing stock in cities like Cleveland and rent it out at market rates without spending money on upkeep. “The large majority of the purchases on the east side of Cleveland are investor purchases,” he said. “So we’re seeing people … who are paying the same amount that they would have been paying five years ago for a place, except now the place is actually a condemned building.” He added that significant investments were being made on higher-end rental units, which has left people searching for the few affordable places to go.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some cities, prices are still 30 percent higher than they were before the pandemic, Warnock says.  “[That is] certainly not something your average, everyday person can just absorb.”</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">If rents return to their pre-pandemic normal, we’ll still be in a situation that’s difficult for many families. In 2019, the percentage of renters who spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities — an “affordability” benchmark — <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was 46 percent</a>, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. What’s new is that a growing number of middle-income renters are struggling to afford their housing costs as well. Between 2014 and 2019, the share of middle-class renters (i.e., those with incomes between $30,000 and $74,999) whose housing costs were higher than that benchmark <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rose 4 percentage points, to 41 percent.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even as more people in more places are struggling … there’s suddenly less support. Many of the COVID-19 relief programs have <a href="https://nlihc.org/era-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run out of money</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some cities have tried to fill that gap. This past summer, the Cleveland City Council <a href="https://mayor.clevelandohio.gov/news/pay-stay-ordinance-offers-clevelanders-protection-eviction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed an ordinance</a> that halts eviction proceedings if a tenant can come up with the full amount of back rent and any late fees by their court date. Voters in <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/09/21/st-paul-city-council-passes-sweeping-overhaul-of-rent-control-ordinance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cities</a> and <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/09/13/oregon-maximum-rent-increase-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states</a> around the country <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/28/1138633419/rent-control-economists-tenants-affordable-housing-ballot-measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed rent stabilization ordinances</a>, which prevent landlords from increasing rates more than a certain percentage on existing tenants. <a href="https://stpetecatalyst.com/city-officials-hope-new-initiatives-increase-adus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Petersburg, Florida</a>, and some <a href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/2022/11/27/yarmouth-planning-board-looks-to-fix-extra-apartment-bylaw/69670810007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communities in Cape Cod</a> and <a href="https://www.kcbx.org/infrastructure-housing-and-development/2022-12-13/santa-barbara-to-review-city-regulations-on-accessory-dwelling-units-amid-housing-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> are also trying to make it easier to build detached accessory dwelling units on existing properties, which could be rented out to single people or small families.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But those are piecemeal solutions to a fundamental problem that remains: There <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/upshot/housing-shortage-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not enough housing for people to live in</a>, and it’s gotten more unaffordable for a wider swath of Americans. A recession, if it happens, would hit renters even harder, and more families are stuck in the rental market while interest rates remain high. It’s a big problem that’s been brewing nationwide for decades, just more visible now.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">If Rep. Kevin McCarthy didn’t have a lucky number before, it’s surely 15 now. Just after midnight on Saturday morning, the House of Representatives finally voted to make McCarthy speaker of the House on the 15th ballot — the resolution of an historic, multi-day staredown with conservative hardliners who will now wield tremendous power in the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For a while there, McCarthy looked like he <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-speaker-kevin-mccarthy-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might never gain the speaker’s gavel at all</a>. At the height of opposition to him — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/04/us/politics/house-speaker-vote-tally.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between the third and 11th ballots</a> — 20 Republicans voted for a non-McCarthy candidate, putting him far away from the majority of votes necessary to win. As I wrote on Wednesday, those dissenters were among the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/20-house-republicans-oppose-mccarthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most conservative, most anti-establishment Republicans in the House</a>. The chart below uses incumbents’ <a href="https://voteview.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DW-NOMINATE</a> scores (ideology scores based on their congressional voting records) to plot them along two axes: left vs. right and pro-establishment vs. anti-establishment.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newly elected representatives do not have DW-NOMINATE scores because they don’t have voting records yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> Notice how McCarthy’s opponents are all in the lower-right part of the chart. It’s almost like they are their own political party (more on that in a bit).</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Thursday night and Friday morning, though, McCarthy <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/06/mccarthy-emerging-deal-conservatives-00076862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck a deal</a> with many of his detractors, and 13 of those who had previously voted for a non-McCarthy candidate <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/06/house-speaker-vote-day-4-00076738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came over to his side</a> on the 12th ballot on Friday afternoon.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As did Rep. Victoria Spartz, who had voted “present” — a form of abstention — on ballots four through 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> From there, McCarthy chipped away at his remaining opposition throughout Friday, eventually coming just one vote shy on the dramatic 14th ballot, when Rep. Matt Gaetz stubbornly withheld his vote even after a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/house-devolves-into-chaos-rogers-lunges-matt-gaetz-mccarthy-loses-2023-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heated confrontation</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the following ballot, all of McCarthy’s remaining opponents caved, though not all the way: They voted “present,” essentially an abstention that lowered the threshold McCarthy needed to win. In the end, he received just 216 votes, but that was a majority of the 428 ballots cast for candidates. Thus ended the <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-Multiple-Ballots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fifth-longest speaker election</a> in U.S. history by number of ballots, the fourth-longest by number of days, and the longest no matter how you slice it since before the Civil War.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But about that deal. In order to achieve his <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decade-long ambition</a>, McCarthy made several concessions that will weaken the speakership and strengthen his right-wing, anti-establishment antagonists. One point of contention had been the number of representatives it would take to trigger a “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/motion-vacate-key-sticking-point-gop-speaker-battle/story?id=96241364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motion to vacate the chair</a>” — essentially, a no-confidence vote in the speaker. Previously, it would have taken a majority of the Republican caucus to call that vote, but McCarthy has reportedly agreed to lower that threshold to just one member.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That sounds like a big change, but it’s really a reversion to how things used to be. Historically, one member has been the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/03/motion-vacate-house-speaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal threshold</a> to trigger a motion to vacate — it was that way until 2019, when Democrats raised it. And in all those years, the only time the motion actually led to a vote was in <a href="https://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/36542?ret=True" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1910</a>, although an unsuccessful motion was also filed in <a href="https://rollcall.com/2015/07/28/meadows-maneuvers-to-remove-boehner-as-speaker-updated-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015</a>. Although the motion might get more use in today’s contentious Congress, it would still require a majority vote of the whole House to actually oust the speaker — meaning five Republicans would have to agree with all 213 Democrats<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming Democrat Jennifer McClellan wins the upcoming special election in Virginia’s 4th District, as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> for McCarthy to lose his job.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A more meaningful concession is McCarthy’s reported agreement to reserve three seats for hard-core conservatives on the House Rules Committee. The Rules Committee is <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/01/06/nation/why-committee-youve-never-heard-could-be-whole-ballgame-speaker-fight/?event=event25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most powerful committees in the House</a> — setting the rules (duh) of debates, choosing which pieces of legislation to bring up to a vote and even rewriting legislation that has already passed another committee. If the Rules Committee maintains its traditional partisan composition — nine members of the majority party, four of the minority — then it could have six McCarthy-aligned Republicans, three insurgent Republicans and four Democrats, which means that McCarthy-aligned Republicans would constitute a minority on the committee. In the words of one conservative activist, that would effectively make the Rules Committee a “<a href="https://www.grid.news/story/politics/2023/01/06/the-democrats-the-republicans-and-the-freedom-caucus-inside-the-rights-plans-to-seize-power-in-the-new-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European-style coalition government</a>” where the hard-right bloc is like a third party, and McCarthy and his allies would have to negotiate with them (or Democrats) to get anything done.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This, in turn, could make it more likely that the federal government shuts down and/or defaults on its debt in 2023. The insurgent wing of the GOP was at the center of the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/10/03/228832618/for-tea-party-shutdown-is-worth-the-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government shutdown fight in 2013</a> and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/11/16/23433281/congress-debt-ceiling-house-midterms-spending-cuts-lame-duck-session" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debt ceiling fight in 2011</a>, and McCarthy has <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1611481220554149891?s=46&amp;t=HxjYFZUndxpIfxLsiwDwiA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to fight</a> for their preferred <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-06/mccarthy-s-emerging-speaker-deal-tees-up-75-billion-defense-cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending cuts</a> here in 2023. But of course, nothing can become law without buy-in from the Democrats who still control the Senate and the White House, who are about as ideologically far removed from the conservative hardliners as it gets. So this week’s fight in Congress could presage other, even higher-stakes ones — and now, Kevin McCarthy is the lucky duck who gets to be in the middle of them.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Many of us at FiveThirtyEight have been glued to C-SPAN this week, as we’ve watched the yet-to-be-sworn-in House repeatedly try — and fail — to elect a speaker. With a slim majority in the chamber, Republicans were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/20-house-republicans-oppose-mccarthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held hostage by a far-right flank</a> of the party that refused to support the establishment pick Rep. Kevin McCarthy, leading to multiple, redundant rounds of voting and <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanewells/status/1610701399343665153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some heated</a> <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?525124-101/representative-marjorie-taylor-green-criticizes-party-colleagues-opposed-kevin-mccarthys-bid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infighting</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While this political stalemate is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/04/1146841362/house-speaker-vote-struggle-100-years-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notably historic</a>, it can also feel a bit inside baseball. It got me wondering how Republican voters are feeling about the party and its leadership as a whole. It’s a bit too early to have polling on this week’s dramatics, but some recent surveys have captured the general mood of Republicans heading into the vote for speaker. In <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2022/12/1/23472338/poll-shows-move-on-from-trump-biden-mcconnell-mccarthy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a late November poll</a> from Deseret News/HarrisX, Republicans were pretty evenly split on whether they thought McCarthy should continue to be a party leader: Thirty-five percent said he should maintain his role as a leader, 33 percent said the party should move on from McCarthy, and 32 percent said they were unsure or didn’t know. This ambivalence about McCarthy stood in contrast to Republicans’ feelings toward other party leaders, which were much more cohesive. Most Republicans said that former President Donald Trump should remain a leader and that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ought to be replaced. Similarly, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/3jonl2kylh/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in another poll from November</a> fielded by The Economist/YouGov, 39 percent of Republicans said McCarthy should remain a leader in the House, but a slim majority (51 percent) said they either didn’t know or didn’t care. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not that McCarthy is wildly unpopular among Republicans, but he’s not exactly a fan favorite, either. In that Economist/YouGov poll, 45 percent of Republicans viewed McCarthy favorably, compared to 31 percent who viewed him unfavorably — not great, but not as bad as, say, McConnell, who had a 55 percent unfavorable rating amongst his party. A <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23438406/cnn-poll-midterm-parties.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN/SSRS poll in December</a> found McCarthy’s net approval was +30 points among Republicans, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/01/politics/house-speaker-vote-mccarthy-history-polling/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second-lowest same-party net favorability</a> among all first-time potential speakers in nearly three decades. That same poll also found 15 percent of Republicans had “never heard of” McCarthy, while 28 percent had no opinion of him. And the GOP rank and file’s relatively lukewarm feelings for McCarthy may be emboldening right-wing dissenters to continue their crusade against his speakership — polling suggests voters won’t be fussed too much whether McCarthy is speaker or not. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And overall, Republican voters seem open to shaking things up when it comes to party leadership. In <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/COSA-GOPLeadership-Full-Report-1121.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a late November poll</a> from the Trafalgar Group/Convention of States Action, voters were asked, “After the results of the 2022 midterm elections do you think Republicans need new leadership in Congress?” and 73 percent of Republicans said yes (though, as you can see, the question was a bit leading). <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3796420-large-majority-of-gop-voters-support-replacing-mcdaniel-as-rnc-chair-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another poll from Trafalgar Group/COSA released this week</a> found Republicans overwhelmingly would like to see a new party chair: Seventy-three percent said the GOP should elect someone other than current Chair Ronna McDaniel at upcoming meetings, while just 6 percent said McDaniel should be reelected. That’s to say nothing of the ongoing debate over who ought to be the party’s presidential nominee next year: While Trump is still very popular among Republican voters, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-desantis-is-a-major-threat-to-trumps-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has picked up</a> some serious early steam, suggesting voters have at least some appetite for change even at the highest level of party leadership.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So given its disappointing showing in the 2022 midterms and voters’ stated desire for new blood, the GOP would be arguably unwise to not consider shaking things up a bit. Whether that helps drive someone other than McCarthy to the speaker’s chair is, as of publication, still yet to be seen. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites </strong></h2>



<ul><li>Recent <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/467528/americans-largely-pessimistic-prospects-2023.aspx">polling from Gallup</a> suggests that Americans aren’t too optimistic about the country’s prospects in 2023. The overwhelming majority of Americans (90 percent) said that this year will be one of political conflict, as opposed to political cooperation, while around three-quarters predict economic difficulty (79 percent) and increased crime rates (72 percent). That said, the general mood seems to split along partisan lines, with Democrats feeling more positively than Republicans and independents falling somewhere in the middle: For example, 53 percent of Democrats believe that the stock market will pan out positively this year, versus 15 percent of Republicans and 33 percent of independents. In contrast, it seemed like the two parties were most closely aligned in believing that Russia’s global dominance will dampen in 2023. </li><li>A <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/national/2022/12_27_2022_final_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=7039E6CC467C62FF5D7C108EAD41D4E7A3BD0902">USA Today/Suffolk University survey</a> conducted last month shed light on the traits and attributes that Americans would like in their ideal president come 2024. Half of the survey’s respondents said they’d prefer a president between 51 and 65 years old, while another quarter favored someone between 35 and 50. And while 55 percent of Americans said that gender doesn’t matter, 28 percent preferred a man — a number that rises distinctly among Republican respondents (50 percent). Further, Midwesterners were more likely than respondents from other regions to prefer the executive come from their own region: Twenty-seven percent of Midwestern Americans favored someone from the heartland, while 20 percent of East Coasters, 18 percent of Southerners and 16 percent of West Coasters said the same about a president from their home regions. </li><li>Around half of Americans (49 percent) think that people are less comfortable being around those who are sick now compared with before the pandemic, per <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2023/01/03/fff5a/1">a Jan. 3 YouGov poll</a>. Age seems to be a factor, as 57 percent of Americans age 65 or older were less comfortable. That checks out with other <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2023/01/03/fff5a/2">questions from that same YouGov survey</a>, in which 50 percent of Americans said that parents have become more cautious about their children contracting and spreading illnesses since the onset of COVID-19. </li><li>Since Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest in the middle of a game earlier this week, there’s been a renewed focus on the dangers of football and the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-leadership-wasnt-prepared-for-damar-hamlins-injury/">NFL’s role in ensuring its players’ safety</a>. According to a Jan. 3 poll <a href="https://civicscience.com/immediate-insights-forty-percent-of-u-s-adults-dont-trust-the-nfl-at-all-to-handle-player-safety/">conducted by CivicScience</a>, 40 percent don’t trust the NFL at all to address players’ safety concerns, while 41 percent have only a little trust. The lack of faith, however, doesn’t seem to affect whether people will tune in to watch. Among NFL viewers, a large majority (72 percent) said they haven’t considered not watching games in light of player safety concerns. </li></ul>
