<p>Polls conducted after June 28, 2018, the date this page was published, are listed by the date that FiveThirtyEight collected them; polls conducted before then are listed under the last date that the poll was in the field. Polls from firms that are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/">banned by FiveThirtyEight</a> are not shown. Pollsters that did not release any horse-race polls within three weeks of an election since 1998 do not have a grade and are treated as a C+ by the grade filter.</p>
<p>* Polls marked with an asterisk are <em>partisan</em> polls. Partisanship is determined by who sponsors the poll, rather than who conducts it. Polls are considered partisan if they’re conducted on behalf of a candidate, party, campaign committee, or PAC, super PAC, 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(6) organization that conducts a large majority of its political activity on behalf of one political party.</p>
<p>When the dates of tracking polls from the same pollster overlap, only the most recent version is shown.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Last Thursday, Republican Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/us/politics/anthony-gonzalez-ohio-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced he would not seek reelection</a> in 2022. The 37-year old congressman was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump</a> after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, and he is now the first to call it quits.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Facing fervent opposition from Trump supporters in his district, a Trump-backed primary challenger and a potentially thorny redistricting process — Ohio will lose a congressional district after apportionment — Gonzalez decided there was no future for him in the GOP. It’s early yet, but Gonzalez’s retirement could foreshadow what awaits the other nine House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump; many of them could face a difficult path to reelection. And if they retire like Gonzalez or lose reelection, the outcome will likely be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congressional-republicans-left-office-in-droves-under-trump-just-how-conservative-are-their-replacements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an even Trumpier Republican Party</a> in Washington.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, all but one of these 10 Republicans has received a formal rebuke from their state or local party committees, as the table below shows. Additionally, all 10 now face at least one primary challenger (or faced, in the case of Gonzalez). While not all of these intraparty opponents are real threats, many are shaping up to be roadblocks to renomination. This is particularly true in the four districts where Trump has endorsed a primary challenger, including Gonzalez’s race, where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/07/28/max-miller-ohio-congress-trump-profile-500187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Trump aide</a> Max Miller has <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/02/former-donald-trump-aide-max-miller-announces-gop-primary-bid-against-us-rep-anthony-gonzalez-claiming-endorsement-from-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the former president’s backing</a> and, now, no incumbent to run against.</p>

 <p>*Gonzalez announced on Sept. 16 that he wouldn’t seek reelection in 2022.</p>
 <p>Rebuke includes a censure or public admonishment by a Republican Party committee at the state, district or county level.</p>
 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And outside of Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021-22 redistricting process could be an added complication</a> for these representatives, too.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyoming will continue to have only one at-large district, so the district lines won’t change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> These 10 members can largely be split into two groups: those most endangered by primary challenges and those most endangered by redistricting. Let’s start with those facing the toughest primary hurdles — the three incumbents besides Gonzalez who face a Trump-endorsed challenger.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s endorsement track record is a bit of a mixed bag in that there is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some evidence that he padded his record in 2020</a> — that is, endorsing candidates who were already likely to win — so it’s unclear how powerful a Trump-endorsement will be in 2022. But at this point, Cheney may be in the most trouble, despite being the strongest fundraiser and the most well-known of the Republicans who backed impeachment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this month, former Republican National Committee member Harriet Hageman <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/hageman-announces-bid-to-unseat-cheney/article_47bbadd6-409f-5ff9-a8e0-9f97b6ebfd25.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered the Wyoming House race</a>, with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/09/politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-cheney-challenger/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an endorsement from Trump</a>. Hageman could prove to be a powerful opponent, too, considering <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/07/liz-cheney-potential-challenger-harriet-hageman-rnc-510315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her political background</a> and competitive showing in the 2018 GOP primary for Wyoming governor — <a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/2018/Results/Primary/2018_Statewide_Candidates_Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she won 21 percent in a crowded race</a>, finishing just 12 percentage points behind now-Gov. Mark Gordon. Hageman may also be able to consolidate <a href="https://twitter.com/allymutnick/status/1390005987399151621" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Cheney sentiment</a> in the state, which would be a blow to the incumbent, who would benefit from a large, fragmented field. Tellingly, <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/rep-chuck-gray-suspends-campaign-to-unseat-cheney/article_bdc106e0-6862-546a-8b1b-1b3c9a99806f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three other primary challengers</a> have already withdrawn from the race, <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/two-candidates-leave-house-race-on-day-of-trump-endorsement/article_667d778a-4430-5f74-8fec-a3a266ede310.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two of whom then endorsed Hageman</a>. Just one notable candidate has <a href="https://www.wyofile.com/pressure-builds-for-candidates-to-drop-out-after-trump-endorsement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to drop out</a> at this point: state Sen. Anthony Bouchard. But it’s hard to know how much support Bouchard’s candidacy will garner due to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/us/politics/anthony-bouchard-14-year-old.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the disturbing revelation</a> that he impregnated a 14-year old girl when he was 18 and married her when she was 15.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also in this category are Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington. Upton faces Trump-backed state Rep. Steve Carra, who recently <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/22/michigan-lawmaker-introduces-bill-require-election-audit/5297929001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced legislation to audit Michigan’s 2020 election results</a>. This, in large part, <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/07/trump-endorses-michigan-primary-challenger-u-s-rep-upton/5757497001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains his endorsement by the former president</a>, which could help topple Upton, who was also <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2021/02/cass-county-gop-joins-other-republicans-in-censuring-rep-fred-upton-for-impeachment-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured</a> <a href="https://www.heraldpalladium.com/communities/st_joseph/berrien-county-republican-party-leaders-vote-to-censure-upton/article_3ead8556-e09f-5276-943a-6f3dd94ba19d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by at least five</a> GOP county committees in his district for supporting impeachment. Upton has been around for a long time (he won his first election in 1986), but he might be vulnerable, too, as his lone 2020 primary opponent <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2020PRI_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won 37 percent</a> despite <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/06/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising almost no money</a> and attracting little notice — and this was before Upton voted to impeach Trump. Meanwhile, Herrera Beutler’s main challenger in Washington is <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/trump-endorses-joe-kent-republican-challenger-to-rep-jaime-herrera-beutler-who-voted-for-impeachment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump endorsee</a> Joe Kent, a former Special forces officer and husband to a Gold Star recipient. Like Carra, Kent has questioned the 2020 election results, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/politics/impeachment-republicans-house-reelection/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telling CNN in July</a> that “I think Trump won, but I want to prove it.” However, the electoral math might be more complicated in Washington than Michigan because of Washington’s top-two primary system (also used in California), where the top-two vote getters — regardless of party — advance to the November general election. If Democrats consolidate around one candidate, Herrera Beutler could still attract enough backing from some Republicans and independents to finish second and advance. Moreover, the anti-Herrera Beutler vote could be fragmented among Kent and Heidi St. John, a Christian author and home-schooling advocate who has <a href="https://www.clarkcountytoday.com/news/candidate-heidi-st-john-offers-sharp-response-to-former-presidents-endorsement-of-her-fellow-candidate-joe-kent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized Kent as a carpetbagger</a> who only recently moved to the southwestern Washington district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Reps. Tom Rice of South Carolina and Dan Newhouse of Washington don’t yet have Trump-endorsed opponents, they still face more primary woes than redistricting problems. Rice, for instance, has to win a majority of the vote in the Republican primary — or a majority in a runoff if no candidate initially wins more than 50 percent of the vote. This isn’t true of the other Republicans we’ve examined, which means a crowded candidate field could be especially tricky for Rice as he can’t skate by with a plurality win in the primary. Rice currently <a href="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/politics-government/article253295638.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces at least three serious-looking GOP opponents</a> in conservative media personality Graham Allen, state Rep. Russell Fry and Horry County school board chair Ken Richardson, along with a host of other Republicans. (Eight Republicans are running against Rice so far.) Newhouse, meanwhile, also has <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/former-washington-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-loren-culp-files-to-challenge-republican-rep-dan-newhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three notable Republican opponents</a>: Loren Culp, a former police officer and Washington’s GOP nominee for governor in 2020, as well as state Rep. Brad Klippert and businessman Jerrod Sessler. Like Herrera Beutler, Newhouse might benefit from Washington’s top-two primary format if he can retain enough base support while the other Republican contenders split the rest of the GOP vote. And Newhouse <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20160802/congressional-district-4-us-representative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has performed this feat before</a> in his solidly red district and <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20161108/congressional-district-4-us-representative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone on to win in November</a> against another Republican, so it’s plausible that his impeachment vote could win over some independent and Democratic voters in both the primary and the general. But it would not be a shock to see Trump step in to better help Republicans consolidate around one opposition candidate — perhaps Culp, who <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/loren-culp-refusing-to-concede-washington-gubernatorial-race-turns-on-top-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made false claims</a> about widespread voter fraud in the state’s 2020 gubernatorial election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for the other four other Republican representatives who voted to impeach Trump, they may face more danger from redistricting at this point. Reps. John Katko of New York and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois both hail from states where Democrats could change their district lines to make it harder for the Republicans to win reelection. Katko has held onto his Democratic-leaning district since he first won in 2014, but in an effort to defeat him, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Democrats</a> could <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1427389029562077188?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make his seat even bluer</a> and/or draw him in with Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney in the hopes that her more conservative track record would help her best Katko in a GOP primary, perhaps making her easier to defeat in a general election. So far, Katko has only <a href="https://auburnpub.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/rep-john-katko-gets-gop-primary-challenger/article_51667a90-228b-5604-89f1-d2759b84e642.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracted minor primary opposition</a>, but Trump said this summer <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2021/06/donald-trump-offers-to-back-challenger-to-rep-john-katko-he-is-bad-news.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would back a high-profile conservative challenger</a> if one could be found. Meanwhile, Kinzinger’s seat in exurban Chicago <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/25/adam-kinzinger-illinois-democrats-506861" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be dismantled</a> by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic mapmakers in Illinois</a>, potentially forcing him into an uphill race against an incumbent. And if he faces another Republican, he might have a particularly difficult time winning a primary <a href="https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1004829/gop-rep-adam-kinzinger-calls-trump-one-of-the-weakest-men-that-ive-ever-seen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given his criticism of Trump</a>. After all, even if Kinzinger ends up with a decent district to run in, he will still <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-catalina-lauf-challenge-kinzinger-congress-16th-district-20210224-rohj5knnhvfknnxxdjslqzzkny-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face a primary challenge</a> from former Trump administration official Catalina Lauf.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The two remaining Republicans who voted in favor of impeachment, Reps. David Valadao of California and Peter Meijer of Michigan, don’t have to worry about Democratic state legislators targeting them because their states use independent redistricting commissions. However, Valadao already holds the bluest seat of any Republican in the House, so any shift to the left could cost him reelection. Valadao also has to navigate the top-two primary format, but unlike Herrera Beutler and Newhouse, he doesn’t have much Republican opposition. The <a href="https://www.ourvalleyvoice.com/2021/04/16/chris-mathys-holds-town-hall-in-campaign-against-valadao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only notable Republican to pop up</a> is Chris Mathys, a former Fresno city councilman who actually ran a distant third in a GOP primary for a House seat in <em>New Mexico </em>last year. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/few-incumbents-are-safe-michigans-draft-congressional-district-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial draft maps</a> from Michigan’s redistricting commission created a Grand Rapid-based district that Trump would have carried by less than 1 point in 2020. If lines like that hold true for the final map, that could make Meijer’s seat slightly more Democratic than it is right now (<a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump +3 in 2020</a>). That area <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?type=county&amp;year=2020&amp;fips=26081&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved to the left during the Trump era</a>, and it could continue to do so. But working in Meijer’s favor is that he lacks a high-profile GOP primary opponent — the most <a href="https://www.fox17online.com/news/politics/meijer-attracts-gop-primary-challenger-after-impeachment-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable name at this point is Tom Norton</a>, who <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2020PRI_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished a distant third</a> behind Meijer in the 2020 primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Gonzalez already headed for the exits, the departure of some or most of these 10 members could have large consequences for the Republican Party — and democracy itself. Nine of the 10 Republicans who voted for impeachment ranked among the 28 Republican House members who have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-senators-and-representatives-vote-in-favor-of-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely to vote in ways to protect electoral democracy</a>, according to FiveThirtyEight’s recent analysis of congressional voting patterns.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the “bare-bones” pro-democracy vote percentage analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> In fact, Cheney, Katko and Kinzinger were the likelist members of the House GOP to vote in favor of pro-democracy positions. But those three may be most in danger of losing their seats. And now with Gonzalez’s retirement and the difficult paths to reelection for many of the other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, it seems there’s not so much an intraparty debate with the GOP about Trump’s position in the party, but rather a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-voters-say-they-dont-mind-trump-critics-but-liz-cheneys-ouster-says-otherwise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-sided battle</a> where the small minority looks set to get even smaller.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Sept. 21, 2021, 9:32 a.m.):</strong> Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was narrowly elected to a third term in Monday’s election in Canada. As of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/federal/2021/results/">9:30 a.m. Eastern on Sept. 21</a>, the Liberals had won or were ahead in 158 seats, the Conservatives had won or were ahead in 119 seats and the New Democratic Party had won or was ahead in 25 seats — very similar to their numbers in the previous Parliament.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Below is our preview of how Canada got to this point and the stakes in this election.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">It’s always an election year if you know where to look. This time, it’s up north: Canada heads to the polls today to decide whether to elect Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to another term. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Think of this election like a U.S. presidential and congressional election all rolled into one: Under Canada’s parliamentary system, each of Canada’s 338 electoral districts (called “ridings”) will elect a member of Parliament using normal first-past-the-post, plurality rules. (Unlike <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/which-european-countries-use-proportional-representation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some other parliamentary democracies</a>, Canada does not use proportional representation.) And the leader of the party that wins control of Parliament will become the new prime minister.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Right now, the election looks like a close race between Trudeau’s center-left Liberal Party and the center-right Conservative Party. But Canada’s many smaller parties could play decisive roles too. Here are five questions we’ll be looking to get answered as the results roll in starting tonight.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like in the U.S., mail voting means we won’t know the full results of the election for days. A &lt;a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/election-2021/record-number-of-mail-in-ballot-requests-means-very-likely-vote-result-wont-be-known-election-night" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;record 1.2 million mail ballots&lt;/a&gt; have been requested, and they won’t even begin to be counted until Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a></p>



<h2><strong>1. Did Trudeau end his own political career?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The biggest question, of course, is whether Trudeau will survive as prime minister. And if he is ousted, it could go down as one of the biggest self-owns in political history. That’s because Canada wasn’t originally scheduled to hold a vote this year; Trudeau <em>chose</em> to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-election-call-1.6141189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold an early election</a> in response to polls showing the Liberals with a solid lead. (Liberals held only 155 seats in the outgoing House of Commons<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada’s Parliament has two chambers, the Senate and House of Commons, but the Senate is not elected and the House of Commons has far more power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> — shy of a majority of 170, which made it <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/10/03/life-is-about-to-get-harder-for-canadas-minority-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difficult</a> for Trudeau to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/justin-trudeau-parliament-slow-start_ca_5e49e789c5b64433c6183bfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">govern</a>.) The strong polls gave Trudeau hope that Liberals could win a majority in a snap election. But after the election was greenlit in August, the polls immediately tightened, and the Conservatives even briefly took the lead — making Trudeau’s decision look like a huge miscalculation.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/upcoming-elections-us-political-climate-80002422</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Things are looking a bit better for the prime minister now, though. Canada has two prominent, FiveThirtyEight-style election forecasters: Philippe J. Fournier of <a href="https://338canada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">338Canada</a> and Éric Grenier, who writes the newsletter <a href="https://www.thewrit.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Writ</a> and runs the <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poll Tracker</a> for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when Canada had just 308 ridings, Grenier also used to issue his forecasts at &lt;a href="http://www.threehundredeight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ThreeHundredEight.com&lt;/a&gt;. This numbers-as-website-names thing is sweeping the globe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> And as of Sunday evening,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> they gave Liberals a 68 percent and 75 percent chance of winning the most seats, respectively. However, it looks pretty unlikely that Trudeau will get his coveted majority government: There is only a 15-17 percent chance that Liberals win 170 or more seats. In fact, both the Poll Tracker (154) and 338Canada (147) are estimating that Liberals will win fewer seats than the 155 they had before the election, though of course there is a wide margin of error on those projections. So Trudeau may yet live to regret calling this election.</p>



<h2><strong>2. How will the Conservatives do under their new leader?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is also a high-risk, high-reward election for the Conservative Party’s Erin O’Toole, who was chosen as the Conservative leader just last year. While O’Toole was initially <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/party-leaders-canada-abacus-july-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular with the Canadian public</a>, his centrist persona has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/10/canada-election-erin-otoole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped make the party competitive</a> (though he has also had some <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8169157/otoole-firearm-bans-conservative-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stumbles</a>). These days, the Poll Tracker gives Conservatives an average seat projection of 118 and a 25 percent chance of winning the most seats, while 338Canada is a little more optimistic for them (127 seats and a 31 percent chance). So while the likeliest outcome is that they will stand pat or make only small gains (they went into the election with 119 seats), they are still only a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal polling error away</a> from becoming the biggest party in the House of Commons. On the flip side, though, there is still a significant chance that they lose seats, which could cost O’Toole his job as party leader.</p>

<h2><strong>3. How many seats will the New Democrats gain?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Canada differs from the U.S. in that an analysis of its elections can’t stop with just the two dominant parties. The left-wing New Democratic Party is also a major player; in fact, it could be the biggest beneficiary of this election. The Poll Tracker and 338Canada are forecasting that the NDP will win 34 seats and 32 seats, respectively, up from 24 in the previous Parliament. That’s largely thanks to the charisma of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/a-long-time-coming-jagmeet-singh-s-victory-a-historic-win-for-visible-minorities-1.4316002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first person of color to lead a major Canadian party</a>; he <a href="https://angusreid.org/federal-election-post-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently</a> <a href="https://researchco.ca/2021/09/14/elxn44-canada-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earns</a> the <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8145113/canada-election-ipsos-leadership-singh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest favorable ratings</a> of <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/daily-tracking-poll-election-44-sept-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any of the party leaders</a>. Nevertheless, the NDP has still struggled to break into the first tier. It trails the Liberals and Conservatives by double digits in the polls, and the forecasters give the party virtually no chance of winning the most seats.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Will the nascent right-wing parties be a factor?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Like in the U.S., Canada’s right wing has gotten increasingly vocal in recent years (although it represents a much smaller slice of the population than in the U.S.). A new party called the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/maverick-party-alberta-wexit-election-1.6173047" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maverick Party</a>, which advocates for the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-separatism-anger-election-trudeau-1.5336196" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secession</a> of conservative parts of Western Canada, is running <a href="https://www.maverickparty.ca/candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates</a> in 29 ridings, mostly in the rural, inland provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. And former Conservative cabinet minister Maxime Bernier recently splintered off to form the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49719947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People’s Party of Canada</a>, which was originally known for its climate-change skepticism and hardline stance against immigration but this year has become a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/13/canada-election-conservative-ppc-maxime-bernier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vessel for opposition</a> to coronavirus lockdowns, mask mandates and vaccines. (Bernier himself is <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/maxime-bernier-rally-1.6166298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not vaccinated</a> against COVID-19 and was <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/maxime-bernier-manitoba-taken-into-custody-1.6062801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested in June</a> for refusing to self-quarantine after traveling.) According to a recent poll from <a href="http://poll.forumresearch.com/post/3093/opinions-on-vaccines--abortion--gun-control--climate-change-and-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forum Research</a>, 62 percent of PPC supporters were unvaccinated, and 70 percent were “very angry” with the policies of the Canadian government. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Maverick Party is specifically running candidates almost exclusively in solidly Conservative seats, the PPC has a candidate in 312 of the 338 ridings and could very well play spoiler to the Conservatives. Though the PPC is not expected to win any seats of its own, it is averaging around 6-7 percent in the polls,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And interestingly, there is a methodological difference in which polls are picking up more PPC support. According to &lt;a href="https://www.thewrit.ca/p/who-is-voting-for-the-ppc-and-will" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis from Grenier&lt;/a&gt;, online pollsters tend to show lower numbers for the party, while pollsters that use robocalls are finding PPC support as high as the double digits. So the PPC could do even better than we’re expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> enough to <a href="https://www.thewrit.ca/p/who-is-voting-for-the-ppc-and-will" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost the Conservatives a win in some close ridings</a>. And even if it doesn’t, it will be interesting to see how deep anti-establishment grievances run in Trudeau’s Canada.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Will we get another counter-majoritarian result?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the <a href="https://www.elections.ca/res/rep/off/ovr2019app/51/table9E.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous Canadian election</a>, in 2019, Trudeau was actually reelected while losing the national popular vote: The Liberals won 33.1 percent of the vote to the Conservatives’ 34.3 percent. But the Liberals won the most seats because, unlike in the U.S., Canadian geography puts the <em>right</em> at a disadvantage. The places in Canada where one party runs up the biggest margins (thus wasting votes) are not liberal cities but conservative rural areas: In 2019, every candidate who got 70 percent of the vote or more was a Conservative.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible the same thing could happen in 2021: The Liberals and the Conservatives are locked in a virtual tie in the polls at around 31-32 percent. That said, the Liberals are still favored to carry the most seats in that configuration because of the <a href="https://www.thewrit.ca/p/conservative-vote-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conservatives’ vote inefficiency</a>. In fact, Grenier recently estimated that the Conservatives will need to win the national popular vote by more than 3 points to be favored to win the most seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s worth noting that the combined vote of the Liberals and the NDP — whose voters <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8167090/canada-election-voter-choice-ipsos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally prefer</a> Trudeau to O’Toole as their second choice — will surely far exceed the Conservative vote (as it did in 2019). So Conservatives winning the most seats with only a plurality of the vote could also be considered a counter-majoritarian outcome. (The possibility of vote-splitting has led to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00323187090610020301?journalCode=pnzb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many calls</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons_Special_Committee_on_Electoral_Reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electoral reform</a> in Canada, but they haven’t gained traction.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a twist: Thanks to the quirks of the parliamentary system, it’s possible that Conservatives could win the most seats <em>and Trudeau would remain prime minister</em>. Unlike an American president, Trudeau <a href="https://ipolitics.ca/2021/09/10/even-if-reduced-to-2nd-place-trudeau-has-the-right-to-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remains prime minister</a> unless he resigns or is defeated in the House of Commons, and it’s possible that the NDP<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or other left-leaning members of Parliament; the problem is that there likely won’t be many others. The Green Party, for instance, will be lucky to win two seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> would side with the Liberals to keep Trudeau in power. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Coalition governments are <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/coalition-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rare in Canada</a>, though, so Trudeau would probably only try to cling to power in this way if the circumstances were perfect — namely, if Liberals come a very close second to Conservatives in the overall seat count. But it does mean that Trudeau’s chances of staying prime minister are probably higher than the 68-75 percent chance that Liberals have of winning the most seats. Then again, reelection in this way would hardly be a win for Trudeau, as it would put him in a very precarious situation politically — which could lead to more governmental dysfunction and thus, perhaps, another premature election as soon as next year.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roughly two weeks ago, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a highly restrictive abortion law went into effect in Texas</a>, outlawing abortions once fetal cardiac activity can be detected — usually about six weeks into a pregnancy — which is before most women know they are pregnant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, the Department of Justice <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-files-injunction-halt-enforcement-texas-abortion-law/story?id=80026088" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed an emergency injunction</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/09/15/texas-abortion-justice-department-block/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking a judge</a> to halt the law, and a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/15/texas-abortion-law-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing is set for early next month</a> to consider temporarily blocking it, but, as of today, <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/san-antonio/news/2021/09/16/texas-abortion-law-strains-clinics---exactly-what-we-feared-v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no one in Texas</a> has brought a suit against an abortion provider in the state; clinics have said <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/31/texas-abortion-law-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they plan to abide</a> by the law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that hasn’t stopped abortion from once again being at the forefront of American politics. Beyond the Texas law, there is a law in Mississippi <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/17/abortion-supreme-court-takes-case-mississippi-15-week-ban/6056970002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning most abortions</a> after 15 weeks of pregnancy that the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-dont-want-roe-v-wade-repealed-but-many-also-support-restrictions-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is expected to take up later this year</a>. This means abortion could reshape next year’s midterm elections. And although abortion has historically animated Republican voters more, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-may-be-mobilizing-more-democratic-voters-than-republicans-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is proving to be</a> a motivation for Democrats, too. During the summer of 2018, shortly after then-President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh</a> to the Supreme Court, Democrats were increasingly likely to say abortion was an important factor in how they would vote that year. So it’s likely that this year and next, as Roe’s legal status is up in the air and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more states move to pass restrictive abortion bills</a>, the issue will be a top concern for many Democratic voters.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/texas-abortion-ban-rest-country-fivethirtyeight-79824406</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">A recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/07/women-abortion-texas-law-top-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> of registered voters suggests that Democratic women are already prioritizing the issue more than they were prior to Texas’s law taking effect. Per their survey, 14 percent of Democratic women said issues like abortion, contraception and equal pay are their top voting concerns — up 6 percentage points from before the Texas law took effect. To be sure, though, abortion isn’t <em>the</em> top voting issue for Democratic women. The survey notes that the economy (25 percent) and health care (18 percent) each ranked as higher priorities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, among Democrats overall, 10 percent said that abortion, contraception and equal pay were top of mind when voting — up from 5 points from before Texas’s law. Independents seemed to care about these issues, too. The share of independent women who listed these issues as top concerns jumped from 7 percent before the law went into effect, to 10 percent after. (Among all independents, the increase was smaller: 4 percent then to 6 percent now.) Republicans, however, didn’t really budge on the issue. Among Republican women, the percentage who said the issues of abortion, contraception and equal pay were top of mind increased from only 2 percent to 3 percent — the same numbers as for Republicans overall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Majorities of voters have also said they don’t want the high court to overturn Roe. According to a September <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/9/7/amid-texas-abortion-ban-voters-strongly-support-reproductive-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data for Progress</a> survey, which was fielded after the Texas law took effect, 60 percent of likely voters said the Supreme Court should keep Roe intact. This was up 3 points from a similar <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/6/8/voters-agree-that-the-supreme-court-should-uphold-roe-v-wade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data for Progress</a> poll fielded in May. Meanwhile, a September survey from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/hlzpfslijb/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> found that 50 percent of U.S. adults did not<em> </em>want Roe overturned, versus 28 percent who did; this aligns with a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/03/04/roe-v-wade-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate YouGov poll</a> from last year, which found that 49 percent of adults wanted Roe to remain, while only a quarter wanted it overturned. And earlier this month, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/09/09/democrats-displeasure-supreme-court-decision-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov found</a> that half of Americans (50 percent) disapproved of the Texas abortion law, while just 36 percent were in favor of it.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s still early, and even if abortion rights energizes Democrats now, it’s hard to know whether it will be top of mind for them heading into the 2022 midterms. It’s also possible that this issue will also energize anti-abortion Republican voters, as Kavanaugh’s nomination <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-kavanaugh-helping-republicans-midterm-chances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seems to have done in 2018</a>. Back then, GOP voters saw Trump — and the appointment of Kavanaugh — as a way to have a solidly anti-abortion Supreme Court majority, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/us/politics/abortion-republicans-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans began attacking certain Democratic candidates</a> who supported abortion rights or had received funding from Planned Parenthood. Some Republican senators running in red states also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/us/politics/kavanaugh-republicans-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used Kavanaugh and his fight for Senate confirmation</a> to energize voters in states Trump had won in 2016. This was less true in House races — after all, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-it-was-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 was a “blue wave” for Democrats</a> — but in the Senate, it meant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/conservatives-senate-judges-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some staunch, anti-abortion conservatives</a> like Sens. <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/06/claire-mccaskill-vs-josh-hawley-missouri-senate-race-results-2018-963520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josh Hawley</a> in Missouri and <a href="https://www.sba-list.org/newsroom/press-releases/sba-list-declares-victory-pro-life-mike-braun-defeats-donnelly-indiana-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Braun</a> in Indiana were able to defeat incumbent Democrat senators who had voted against Kavanaugh’s nomination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible, then, that abortion will once again energize conservative voters, turning their focus to opportunities to ban abortion elsewhere — not just in the nation’s most conservative states. Which is why we’ll be watching whether other red states move to mirror Texas’s laws — as <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/states-lawmakers-copy-texas-abortion-law/story?id=79818701" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some have already promised to do</a> — and how that might animate GOP voters, as well as the extent to which Democratic voters continue to prioritize abortion rights while Roe’s legal status remains in limbo. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Earlier this month, President Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-order-federal-workers-vaccinated-strategy-combat-delta/story?id=79905030">announced vaccine and testing requirements</a> for both federal employees and private businesses with more than 100 employees. As my colleague Maggie Koerth <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccines-mandates-work-but-theyre-messy-business/">reported last week</a>, vaccine mandates <em>do </em>work — and recent polling suggests that Americans are largely on board with the federal government issuing the mandates. Per the latest <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd__5LyoGqiiaqCuEVAzYJq1U3s49OGfHtrvVuvXvpnX6c-1631651493-0-gqNtZGzNAjujcnBszQb9">Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index</a>, 60 percent of Americans supported Biden’s vaccine mandates. Similarly, 57 percent of Americans supported their own employer requiring vaccines in the workplace. Of course, though, there was a partisan divide. Republicans, who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccine-hesitancy-is-still-strong-in-many-covid-19-battered-states/">are generally more wary</a> about getting the jab, were less likely to support Biden’s policies, according to the poll. Only around one-third of Republicans said they backed Biden’s new requirement on federal employees and his mandate on private businesses. Among Democrats, however, 84 percent supported both mandates.</li><li>Most Americans feel that democracy in the U.S. is under attack or at least being tested, according to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/15/politics/cnn-poll-most-americans-democracy-under-attack/index.html">CNN/SSRS poll</a>. In total, 93 percent of Americans said democracy was either under attack (56 percent) or being tested but not necessarily under attack (37 percent). Republicans were the most likely to say that democracy is under attack (75 percent), compared with just 46 percent of Democrats. This might have something to do with how both self-described conservatives (71 percent) and Americans who disapproved of President Biden (71 percent) were the most likely to believe democracy was under attack .</li><li>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/14/americans-are-less-concerned-but-more-divided-on-climate-change-than-people-elsewhere/">the Pew Research Center published</a> a far-reaching study into the concerns around climate change among residents in some of the world’s most economically developed countries. Among U.S. adults, 60 percent said they were worried about the personal impacts of climate change, whereas, across the 17 nations surveyed, a median of 72 percent of adults shared this sentiment. Notably, an overwhelming majority of people (a median of 80 percent) in these 17 nations — which included places like South Korea, Italy, Japan and Australia — said they’d be willing to make at least some changes to their personal and work lives to help mitigate climate change. Seventy-four percent of Americans said they’d be open to making some changes, too. </li><li>Tailgates, face paint and packed stadiums are back as the 2021 NFL and NCAA football seasons have kicked off while the coronavirus pandemic continues. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/week-1-of-the-nfl-season-already-has-us-changing-our-minds/">Week one of the NFL season</a> has wrapped up, and four of the league’s 32 teams — the Buffalo Bills, Las Vegas Raiders, New Orleans Saints and Seattle Seahawks — have a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/buffalo-bills-require-proof-vaccination-fans-80022380">vaccination or testing policy in place for fans</a>. And according to <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/nfl-favorability-at-67-as-fans-back-vaccination-digital-tickets/">a Harris/Sportico poll</a>, 66 percent of Americans were in favor of a vaccine mandate for fans. But despite <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-player-vaccination-rate-holds-at-93-following-roster-cuts">93 percent of NFL players</a> being vaccinated, <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bears/latest-nfl-rules-covid-fan-vaccinations-and-positive-cases">no team in the NFL</a> has mandated its players to get vaccinated, although the same poll showed that 69 percent of Americans supported such a mandate for coaches and players. </li><li>Most Americans support letting at least some Afghans resettle in the U.S. Per an <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news_and_polls/over-two-thirds-americans-support-resettling-afghan-allies-united-states-09092021">NPR/Ipsos poll</a>, 74 percent of Americans supported admitting Afghans who had worked with the U.S. government, 73 percent supported admitting Afghans who had served in the Afghan special forces and 65 percent supported admitting Afghans who feared oppression from the Taliban. But as FiveThirtyEight contributor Michael Tesler wrote recently, past polling data shows that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-have-a-long-history-of-opposing-refugees-but-most-support-afghan-asylum-seekers/">Americans have a history of opposing refugees</a>, so it’s possible public opinion on this question could eventually fall, although it hasn’t yet.</li><li>Last year, to cope with the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, most Americans <a href="https://www.axios.com/americans-drinking-alcohol-pandemic-29ee70d7-40ae-4e71-807a-3f4ad2ee19b8.html">turned to alcohol</a>.

Per their survey, 50 percent of Americans said they’d made an effort to drink less or implement healthier drinking habits over the last three months, though just 20 percent said they drank less in that timeframe. On the other hand, 55 percent said their personal drinking habits stayed the same over the last three months, while 26 percent said they were drinking more now than three months ago.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">As it is every two years, control of the House and Senate will once again be at stake in the November 2022 midterm elections, and one of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-the-best-tool-we-have-for-understanding-how-the-midterms-are-shaping-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best tools we have</a> for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-works-in-presidential-years-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicting those election results</a> is polling of the generic congressional ballot. The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2002/10/01/why-the-generic-ballot-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot question</a> typically asks respondents which party they intend to vote for in the upcoming congressional election, without naming specific candidates<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact wording can vary. For example, some pollsters ask whether respondents plan to vote for the Democratic candidate or the Republican candidate for Congress; others ask whether respondents would prefer a Congress controlled by Democrats or Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> — allowing the question to be asked nationally to gauge the overall political environment. And for several years now, we at FiveThirtyEight have been <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collecting these polls</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculating</a> a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted average</a> for them, and we’re excited today to publish our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot average for the 2022 election cycle</a>. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1296" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERAL-BALLOT-STORY-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERAL-BALLOT-STORY-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERAL-BALLOT-STORY-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERAL-BALLOT-STORY-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As of Thursday, Sept. 16, Democrats lead Republicans in our polling average by 2.7 percentage points (43.8 percent to 41.1 percent). This average is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-were-tracking-joe-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculated much the same way</a> as our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential approval-rating average</a>, with a couple of differences. First, the lines we draw for the generic-ballot averages are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-a-new-less-volatile-version-of-our-generic-ballot-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more aggressively smoothed</a>;<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the model uses a blend of different quadratic smoothers, with bandwidths of 14, 28 and 42 days (as opposed to 10, 20 and 30 days for the presidential-approval average), and averages these three estimates together. The bandwidth reflects the number of days used to calculate the polynomial: For instance, a 28-day bandwith applied on Sept. 29 would mean that polls from Sept. 1 to Sept. 29 are used in the calculation. The model also requires that a minimum of 20 polls be used in the calculation, so the time intervals under consideration could be even longer in the event of sparse data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> in other words, they are slower to respond to new data. (Because generic-ballot polls are less common than presidential-approval polls, we’ve found that, to filter out noise, the generic-ballot average needs to incorporate a larger sample of polls stretching further back in time than the presidential-approval average.) Second, while our presidential-approval average prefers the versions of polls that survey the widest universe (i.e., all adults over registered voters, and registered voters over likely voters), our generic-ballot average does the opposite. This is because, while we’re interested in knowing what all Americans think about the president, generic-ballot polls are fundamentally election polls — and we’re interested only in how actual voters are going to vote in the midterms. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Historically, a generic-ballot polling average calculated in this way has been very good at predicting the national popular vote for the U.S. House. Using our polling database, we’re able to calculate a retroactive generic-ballot polling average<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, what our generic-ballot average &lt;em&gt;would have&lt;/em&gt; said if FiveThirtyEight had been around at the time and used this same methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> for congressional elections going back to 1980. On average, across those 21 election cycles, our generic-ballot polling average on Election Day missed the House popular vote by only 3.0 points.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1392" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERIC-BALLOT-STORY.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERIC-BALLOT-STORY.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERIC-BALLOT-STORY.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-GENERIC-BALLOT-STORY.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Yes, as you might recall, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-was-the-national-polling-environment-so-off-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic-ballot polls misled in the 2020 election</a>: They gave Democrats an average lead of 7.3 points on Nov. 3, but the party won the House popular vote by only 3.0 points. But that was an unusually large polling error by recent historical standards. In fact, from 2008 to 2018, the average error of our retroactive Election Day generic-ballot polling averages was just 1.3 points. So, 2020 aside, final generic-ballot polls have been remarkably accurate in recent years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, that’s only an argument to pay attention to our generic-ballot average on <a href="https://www.when-is.com/election-day-2022.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nov. 8, 2022</a> — not necessarily today. But it turns out that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-just-look-at-trumps-approval-rating-to-judge-his-first-100-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early generic-ballot polls can be predictive too</a> — if you know how to interpret them. Specifically, for midterm elections, you have to take into account which party holds the White House, since that party is at a natural disadvantage in midterm elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Specifically, the generic-ballot polling average the previous September overestimates the president’s party’s vote margin by an average of 3.5 points.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or 5.2 points if you throw out the 2002 cycle, which, as we’ll explain below, was very unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> This is the manifestation of one of the most ironclad rules in politics: The party that holds the White House <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-that-loses-this-year-could-still-win-a-big-consolation-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost always performs poorly in the midterms</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, there have been some exceptions. Most notable is the 2002 cycle, when then-President George W. Bush’s Republicans trailed in early generic-ballot polls by 6.7 points but wound up winning the House popular vote by 4.6 points. But that year was, well, exceptional: A <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rally-around-the-flag-events-are-rare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally-around-the-flag effect</a> in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks made Bush incredibly popular, and those good feelings rubbed off on his party. The 2006 and 2018 cycles were also exceptions in that the president’s party neither lost nor gained significant ground between the polls and actual results; early generic-ballot polls nailed the final margin almost exactly. But in both those years, the early polls <em>already</em> pointed toward a bad year for the president’s party, showing Bush’s and then-President Donald Trump’s Republicans down by 8.0 and 8.3 points, respectively.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In years when the president’s party leads the generic-ballot polling average the September before the midterms, the party underperforms those polls by an average of 9.3 points. And that, in a nutshell, is why Democrats should be concerned about the 2022 elections despite their current lead on the generic ballot. This cycle so far looks a lot like former President Barack Obama’s two midterms (2010 and 2014) did for Democrats in that they lead generic-ballot polls by a few points in the September of the year before the election. But in both those years, Republicans eventually moved ahead in our generic-ballot polling average and won the election handily.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, if Republicans outperform their early polling to a similar degree as they did in 2010 and 2014, they could win the House popular vote by 5 to 7 percentage points, which would very likely hand them control of the House (and probably the Senate too, since almost everyone votes a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">straight party-line ticket</a> these days). Of course, though, that’s a big <em>if</em>; there has been a lot of variability in these historical trends, so a wide range of outcomes is still possible. But even if Republicans only improve their standing a <em>little</em> bit — something that is likely to happen, if history is any guide — it would probably still be enough to flip the House, considering that their <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-won-almost-every-election-where-redistricting-was-at-stake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control of the redistricting process in a plurality of states</a> is likely to reinforce the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP’s structural advantage in House races</a>. Past trends don’t always hold true, but the smart money, at this point, remains on the president’s party losing control of Congress next year.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">California’s recall election <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/california-recall-election-newsom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has understandably dominated headlines</a>, but there are two other gubernatorial elections this November that might tell us more about the national environment: Virginia and New Jersey. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, President Joe Biden <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried both of these states</a> by double-digit margins in 2020, and neither state has been terribly hospitable to Republicans since former President Trump won the 2016 election. But in recent weeks, Biden’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-declining-approval-rating-is-not-just-about-afghanistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating has taken a sizable hit</a> as the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated and the delta variant of COVID-19 has complicated his efforts to steer the country out of the pandemic. In fact, Biden’s approval rating has fallen to about its lowest point (about 46 percent), while his disapproval rating is up to 49 percent, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>. The upshot is that Biden’s worsening ratings could improve the GOP’s chances of winning these gubernatorial races, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-virginia-governors-race-says-about-where-the-two-parties-are-headed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly in Virginia</a>, which is a more competitive state than New Jersey and doesn’t have an incumbent seeking reelection. Here is the state of play in these two elections a little less than two months before November:</p>



<h2><strong>Virginia</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Virginia has looked like a blue state recently because Biden won the state by 10 percentage points and Democrats have won 13 consecutive statewide races dating back to 2012,<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President and U.S. Senate in 2012; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2013; U.S. Senate in 2014; president in 2016; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2017; U.S. Senate in 2018; and president and U.S. Senate in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> but it’s really more of a purple state with a bluish hue. In 2017, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2017&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the state by 9 points</a> in a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic-leaning political environment</a> with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular Republican president in office</a>. But now with a somewhat unpopular Democrat in the White House, the pendulum could swing back enough to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/07/virginia-governors-race-might-not-be-slam-dunk-democrat-terry-mcauliffe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give Virginia Republicans a real chance at victory</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Virginia prohibits elected governors from seeking consecutive terms, meaning Northam can’t run again this year, but Democrats may have a slight incumbency advantage with nominee Terry McAuliffe: He previously <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2013&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the governorship in 2013</a> when Barack Obama was president — breaking a streak dating back to 1977 whereby the party in the White House lost the Virginia governor’s race. However, Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin has been able to use his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governors-race-financial-disclosures/2021/07/01/b697b70e-da9c-11eb-9bbb-37c30dcf9363_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal wealth</a> to <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/governor/elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay even in the fundraising race</a> with McAuliffe, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/us/politics/in-clinton-fund-raising-expect-a-full-embrace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a track record</a> of raising huge sums. This means that the biggest challenge for Youngkin is not whether he can match McAuliffe in fundraising, but whether he can balance appealing to the GOP base without repelling suburban voters in the state’s metropolitan areas, which he’ll need to win statewide in November.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/upcoming-elections-us-political-climate-80002422</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And the polls at this point suggest the race is pretty close. While McAuliffe <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has led every</a> nonpartisan survey so far, his edge among likely voters has ranged from very competitive to not so competitive (anywhere from 2 to 9 points) since early August. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been much polling released since Biden’s approval rating dropped sharply in mid-to-late August, so it’s hard to know how much of a factor that might be, but we do have one high-quality poll from late August by <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_VA_083121/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University that found</a> McAuliffe ahead by just 5 points, 47 percent to 42 percent, among registered voters. Monmouth’s poll also showed how much turnout could matter in November, as its likely voter results had McAuliffe leading by 2 to 7 points. Our most recent poll, though, is an early-September survey conducted by WPA Intelligence on behalf of Youngkin’s campaign, and <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/523895547/ACFrOgAx7A2J4aZ5gzvUrC92m1AvQlgq7AiRgaBqdvSzsWy2dFKVJM2ppsPeJVebUaROYVBDl8K1TcxXJZldH8-XA0-O7aelJSgbpn1yhfsWQM08PdjXZRmmrnAwAPM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this survey found the race</a> tied and Youngkin ahead by 2 points when <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/local-election-hq/princess-blanding-will-be-on-the-nov-2-ballot-in-the-race-for-virginia-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive third-party candidate</a> Princess Blanding was included as a choice. To be sure, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls should be taken with a grain of salt</a>, but given Biden’s recent drop in approval, it wouldn’t be a shock if Youngkin were, in fact, running neck-and-neck with McAuliffe.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear whether Biden’s drop in approval will stick, but another reason this race is a good proxy for the 2022 midterms is that the race has featured many of the same issues we’ve seen pop up lately in national politics. For instance, there have already been a number of conflicts over how best to combat the coronavirus, with <a href="https://youtu.be/4eaDAX29ogM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAuliffe backing</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-mask-vaccine-mandates/2021/08/12/05eb7d70-fad4-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine and mask mandates</a> and Youngkin opposed to such mandates even though he <a href="https://www.nbc29.com/2021/08/12/mcauliffe-youngkin-call-virginians-get-vaccinated-disagree-about-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said he wants people to get vaccinated</a> and that <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2021/08/08/glenn-youngkin-makes-trip-staunton-show-support-law-enforcement-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those who want to wear masks should do so</a>. Monmouth’s poll suggests, though, that most Virginians approve of <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_va_090821/https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_va_090821/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state requiring students, teachers and staff to wear masks at schools</a> (67 percent), and a slim majority also backed vaccine mandates for children of all ages to attend school in person (52 percent), so this will be an early test of how much the different parties’ stances on handling the pandemic affects voters’ choices. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This election will also serve as an indication of how toxic <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-virginia-elections-election-2020-campaign-2016-c87bf923a4ea7d04e8eb49ad683964b7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s brand remains in Virginia</a>. Trump garnered only about 44 percent of Virginia’s vote in both 2016 and 2020 — <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;type=state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the lowest presidential vote shares</a> for a Republican in the once-red state since 1968. Unsurprisingly, McAuliffe <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/23/biden-youngkin-trump-mcauliffe-campaign-500713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has repeatedly</a> tried to connect Youngkin to the former president, including by attacking Youngkin over <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/youngkin-virginia-election-integrity-rally/2021/08/06/1cf4407a-f538-11eb-9738-8395ec2a44e7_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Republican nominee’s calls for more voting restrictions</a> following Trump’s unfounded claims of election fraud, and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/570732-mcauliffe-releases-new-ad-tying-youngkin-to-trump-on-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by arguing</a> that, like Trump, Youngkin isn’t taking the coronavirus seriously.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Youngkin <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/virginia-campaign-will-test-whether-critical-race-theory-moves-voters-11627304401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tried to hone in on critical race theory</a> — a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades-old academic concept</a> that asserts the existence of systemic racism — which has become a favorite boogeyman of conservatives. As such, Youngkin has <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/billionaire-glenn-youngkin-vows-race-theory-ban-in-bid-for-votes-f9g9vtz09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised to ban</a> the teaching of critical race theory from Virginia schools (<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/10/glenn-youngkin/youngkin-offers-little-proof-critical-race-theory-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite little evidence</a> it’s actually being taught), which he hopes <a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/critical-race-theory-to-face-first-major-political-test-in-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will hurt</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/08/07/northern-virginia-governor-elections-republican/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ support</a> in key suburban communities like Loudoun County, where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/07/07/could-a-school-board-fight-over-critical-race-theory-help-turn-virginia-red-498453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there have been high-profile anti-critical race theory protests</a> at school board meetings, though the <a href="https://vpm.org/news/articles/22982/false-claims-of-critical-race-theory-in-virginia-schools-spark-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">county denies teaching the theory</a>. And a <a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/about/news/rc_poll_politics_aug_2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roanoke College poll</a> from early August suggests that Virginian voters might be concerned about critical race theory. The poll found that slightly more Virginian voters (47 percent) familiar with critical race theory had an unfavorable view of it than a favorable view (40 percent). Youngkin <a href="https://youtu.be/XW-91ocurlI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also argued</a> that McAuliffe did a poor job of handling crime as governor and that the Democratic nominee has the support of groups that want to defund the police amid a national environment where <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;type=state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violent crime rose in 2020</a>. And it seems as if McAuliffe may view this as a potential weakness, as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/568588-mcauliffe-fires-back-at-youngkin-with-ad-touting-support-from-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s already run an ad featuring endorsements</a> from law enforcement officials, who attacked Youngkin over proposed budget cuts that could reduce funding for public safety.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, what happens in Virginia come November will be a test of just how blue the state is, with possible repercussions for the 2022 midterms. Should McAuliffe win despite Biden’s sliding approval rating, that could signal that the Old Dominion really is the Blue Dominion. But if Youngkin wins, that would be evidence that Virginia remains competitive enough that, under favorable conditions, Republicans can still win statewide.</p>



<h2><strong>New Jersey</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in New Jersey, incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is seeking a second term, but at this point, it seems that Murphy’s Republican opponent, former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, will need a lot more help from the national environment in order to defeat Murphy. New Jersey is a bluer state than Virginia — Biden won it by about 16 points in 2020 — and Murphy is a relatively popular incumbent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here, too, the most recent nonpartisan poll of the race comes from <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nj_081821.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University</a> (in the school’s home state), which found Murphy ahead of Ciattarelli by 16 points among registered voters in mid-August. In its two different likely voter scenarios, Monmouth gave Murphy a lead of 11 or 19 points. Moreover, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_nj_082321/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the survey also found</a> 54 percent of voters approved of Murphy’s job performance compared with only 36 percent who disapproved. But this poll was conducted before Biden’s sharp downturn in approval, so it’s possible conditions may have shifted somewhat, although still probably not as much as in Virginia. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The only other recent poll we’ve seen comes from Republican outfit Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates, which found Murphy ahead only by 1 to 2 points in a <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-21-new-jersey-gov-race-memo-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey on behalf of the conservative Club for Growth PAC</a>. And while the same caveats about internal polls in Virginia apply here, the result is far afield from nonpartisan polling, suggesting further polling is needed to see if the race has changed. (For instance, a June poll from <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/fdu-poll-murphy-leads-a-mostly-unknown-ciatterelli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairleigh Dickinson University found Murphy up 15 points</a>.) In fact, a better indication that this race is competitive will be whether Club for Growth spends on behalf of Ciattarelli in the coming weeks.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And Ciattarelli could use some outside financial support, too. We haven’t seen new fundraising numbers since before the June primary, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nj-state-wire-donald-trump-health-coronavirus-pandemic-government-and-politics-e3a2e5b0c7edf92834a0218d0a2d3441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murphy led Ciattarelli</a> by nearly $2 million and he also <a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/07/5-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a massive edge</a> in fundraising by outside groups, as Murphy’s allies at New Direction for New Jersey raised $13.6 million, far more than the nearly $250,000 raised by Ciattarelli’s ally Fix NJ Now. Murphy might have had an even bigger financial advantage if he could self-fund, but <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/fr/murphy-ciattarelli-receive-additional-matching-funds-as-elec-disperses-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s accepted public financing</a> for his campaign, which <a href="https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/gubernatorial/GubPublicFinPP_112020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatly limits personal spending</a>. Still, Republicans are hoping to portray the wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive as an out-of-touch elite. Last month, for instance, the Republican Governors Association <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/governor/rga-enters-n-j-race-with-tv-ad-blasting-murphy/?link_id=51&amp;can_id=8094ef3ca9e2fe4af466070f61a27eb7&amp;source=email-morning-digest-how-the-glory-days-have-passed-the-jersey-gop-by&amp;email_referrer=email_1265447&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-how-the-glory-days-have-passed-the-jersey-gop-by" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran an ad</a> criticizing Murphy for <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/14/nj-gov-phil-murphy-vacations-in-italy-despite-delta-variant-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going on vacation at his Italian villa</a> despite a surge in the delta variant of COVID-19. Meanwhile, Ciattarelli is a lifelong resident of the state, which he <a href="https://eu.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/charles-stile/2021/08/23/nj-governor-race-jack-ciattarelli-phil-murphy-stile/8210195002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tried to use to his advantage</a>, arguing that he’s the “real” New Jerseyan, since Murphy grew up in Massachusetts. As such, Ciattarelli’s <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/08/murphys-gop-rival-slams-him-on-high-nj-taxes-in-first-tv-ad-of-gov-campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first general-election ad</a> attacked Murphy for a 2019 comment in which the governor said that if “you’re a one-issue voter and the tax rate is your issue, we’re probably not your state,” which Ciattarelli argues is a sign Murphy is “<a href="https://twitter.com/Jack4NJ/status/1425808034392121349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too rich to care</a>” about the state. Taxes could be an opening for Ciattarelli, too, as 32 percent of voters named property taxes as a key issue facing New Jersey in Monmouth’s poll. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the same Monmouth poll found 41 percent of voters were especially concerned about COVID-19 — their top issue in a list of more than 20 — and Murphy’s handling of the pandemic has received positive reviews. The poll found 61 percent of voters felt he had done a good job of dealing with the coronavirus, while only 28 percent said he’d done a bad job. Additionally, 46 percent of voters said they trusted Murphy more than Ciattarelli to handle the pandemic, compared with just 21 percent who preferred Ciattarelli on the issue (17 percent said they’d handle it equally well). Ciattarelli, for his part, has tried to dampen Murphy’s edge on handling COVID-19 by <a href="https://hudsoncountyview.com/in-bayonne-ciattarelli-hits-murphy-over-covid-19-decisions-says-he-supports-vaccine-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacking the governor</a> over nursing home deaths due to the disease.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But for Ciattarelli to have a real chance, he will have to win over a large chunk of the 37 percent of New Jerseyans <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/assets/pdf/svrs-reports/2021/2021-0518-voter-registration-by-county.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who are independent voters</a>, compared with the 39 percent who are Democrats and the 22 percent who are Republicans. And at this point, Murphy leads with independents, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nj_081821.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per Monmouth</a>. Whether Ciattarelli will be able to make inroads with this group is unclear, too. The plurality of independent voters (37 percent) named COVID-19 as a top issue, which Murphy polls well on, and Ciattarelli, who <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2021/06/01/nj-republican-gubernatorial-primary-ciatterelli-singh-murphy-trump/7471971002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once had a reputation as an old-school Republican</a> in the state legislature, may alienate independent voters by <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/charles-stile/2021/08/10/nj-republicans-jack-ciattarelli-diane-allen-embrace-trump/5538347001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubling down on his party’s Trumpist base</a>. For instance, Ciattarelli opposes Murphy’s mask mandate for children in schools and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/new-jersey-governor-race-20210906.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has falsely stated</a> that masks hinder <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/benefits-of-kids-wearing-masks-in-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">children’s development</a>, although Monmouth’s poll found 67 percent of New Jersey voters support their state’s mask mandate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the two gubernatorial elections this fall, New Jersey is definitely the undercard event. Yet, while New Jersey is a bluer state than Virginia, Murphy would be the first Democratic governor to win reelection <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/06/no-surprise-here-murphy-officially-wins-democratic-nomination-as-he-runs-for-re-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since Brendan Byrne in 1977</a>. To stop Murphy from pulling this off, Ciattarelli likely needs Biden’s standing to worsen and some of his attacks against Murphy to stick.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The U.S. Census Bureau released a surprising finding in their August announcement of 2020 census results: The number of Americans who identify as multiracial <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped 276 percent over the last decade</a>. Then again, depending on how you count, the share of Americans that identify as white <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/22/1029609786/2020-census-data-results-white-population-shrinking-decline-non-hispanic-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">either rose 2 percent — or dropped 9 percent</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Racial identity is not always easily captured by checkboxes. That’s why we’re hoping to talk with Americans who either feel like the census doesn’t wholly capture their racial identity or identify as a member of one or more racial and ethnic groups. To be sure, <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2021/08/measuring-racial-ethnic-diversity-2020-census.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that can mean a lot of different things</a>, as each person has a unique background and culture that makes his or her story special, but we are particularly interested in talking to people who feel their racial identity is disconnected from what they must put on the census, people who have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/05/millions-of-americans-changed-their-racial-or-ethnic-identity-from-one-census-to-the-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed their racial or ethnic identity</a> over the last decade, and multiracial people with some white ancestry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here are some examples of experiences we’re interested in learning about: Are you Arab American or Iranian American, but <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-census-middle-east-north-africa-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compelled to check “white”</a> on the census? Or were you born to parents who identify with different racial groups? Have you <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/05/millions-of-americans-changed-their-racial-or-ethnic-identity-from-one-census-to-the-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed your racial or ethnic identity</a> over the last decade? And finally, how does the census still fall short of accurately categorizing how you identify? We’re interested in unpacking this and how America’s racial categories have changed over time — especially as to what that means for our growing population. So we want to hear from you. Fill out the survey below, and tell us a bit about yourself, your family and how you would categorize and describe your racial identity. Sharing your thoughts with us will help guide our reporting on changing racial demographics in America. We may also reach out with follow up questions to learn more about how you think about racial identity. We look forward to hearing from you</p>

In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew checks in on the recall and other upcoming races and discusses how former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of one particular candidate is shaping the Wyoming primary. They also talk about surveys on Democrats’ $3.5 trillion social policy and climate change bill and whether they are a good or bad use of polling. Later in the show, FiveThirtyEight senior writers Maggie Koerth and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux come on to talk about President Biden’s sweeping vaccine mandate, how Americans <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccines-mandates-work-but-theyre-messy-business/">feel about vaccine mandates in general</a>, how effective they are and whether Biden’s is legal.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s future will be decided by California voters in only <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/governor-recall-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fourth recall election of a governor</a> in U.S. history. The vote comes after a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/californias-gavin-newsom-will-likely-face-a-recall-election-but-hell-probably-survive-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wave of criticism</a> over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/california-voters-should-start-preparing-for-a-recall-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">months of signature gathering</a> by Newsom’s opponents, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gavin-newsom-has-reason-to-worry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July’s official pronunciation of a recall election</a> and then a two-and-a-half-month campaign sprint to determine whether Newsom should be recalled and, if so, who should replace him as California’s next governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The polls suggest the recall vote is more likely to fail than succeed, but it’s still possible Newsom won’t survive. Whether he continues to hold the state’s top job in Sacramento will affect the state’s governance, its response to COVID-19 and perhaps even the Democrats’ razor-thin majority in the U.S. Senate. Here, then, is a look at the state of the recall polls, who could replace Newsom as governor if he’s recalled and what the fallout might be.</p>


<div>
<p></p><h2>The recall election</h2>
</div>


<p data-paragraph="main">According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/california-recall-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight polling average</a> of the first question on the recall ballot — whether to remove Newsom from office — 41.6 percent of Californians want to recall Newsom, while 56.2 percent want to keep him in office. </p>


<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/california-recall-polls/" target="_blank">
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2014" height="928" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-recall-avg-0912.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-recall-avg-0912.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-recall-avg-0912.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-recall-avg-0912.jpg?w=1400 2x"></figure></a>


<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s important to note that this is <em>not</em> a forecast of what will happen (like those we issue for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">midterm elections</a>); it’s just a description of what the polls have said. Usually, a 14.7-percentage-point polling lead is pretty safe, but this election isn’t usual, so some caution is warranted. This is a particularly challenging race to poll accurately because it’s hard to estimate who’s likely to vote. That’s due to two things in particular: the odd timing of the election (September of an odd-numbered year) and the fact that it is being conducted primarily by mail. In other words, don’t be surprised if there’s a larger-than-usual polling error. Indeed, as CNN’s Harry Enten has observed, the polling average of the previous gubernatorial recall election in California (in 2003) missed the final result <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/03/politics/newsom-rising-polls-recall/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 9 points</a>, and the “true” margin of error of polls of recent U.S. House special elections (which, like this recall, have been oddly timed) is around <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/01/politics/five-reasons-conor-lamb-could-win/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 points</a>. At the same time, as Enten <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/recall-election-california-newsom-final-polls/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote over the weekend</a>, there have been only four gubernatorial races since 1998 (out of 243) where the polling average missed by 15 points or more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, our assessment is that Newsom is a clear favorite to prevail. While an upset wouldn’t be unprecedented, it would qualify as a historically large polling miss.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/catching-california-recall-election-start-fivethirtyeight-79943773</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">For much of August, the recall looked like a legitimate toss-up,<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was partly due to &lt;a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=36cdcb0b-7cfa-4b55-8704-d1f02a9fe6e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one outlier poll&lt;/a&gt; from SurveyUSA that showed Californians in favor of recalling Newsom, 51 percent to 40 percent. SurveyUSA has &lt;a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=f054d152-ceac-48dc-a422-2f22c7a00521" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;since acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that the wording of their likely-voter question “may have led some respondents opposed to the recall to misidentify themselves as being unlikely to vote.” However, even without that SurveyUSA poll, our polling average would have still shown the recall failing by fewer than 4 points as late as Aug. 21, due to &lt;a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/newsom-clings-to-lead-in-recall-while-crime-becomes-a-top-issue-for-ca-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other polls&lt;/a&gt; around that time that &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-vaccinated-say-unvaccinated-add-risk-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;showed a close race&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> but polls have since found Newsom’s lead expanding in the final few weeks. This could be thanks to the stunning amount of money that Newsom and his allies have poured into the campaign during this time: In August alone, they spent <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-09-04/recall-newsom-spending-elder-cox-faulconer-kiley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $36 million</a> on TV ads, digital ads, canvassing, phone banking and text banking. More broadly, it could just be that California voters are finally starting to tune into the election. Ballots were mailed to every registered voter on Aug. 16, which may have activated more voters and made the electorate <a href="https://twitter.com/williamjordann/status/1435642708417208321?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more representative</a> of California’s overall (Democratic-leaning) population. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, many summer polls that showed a close race did so because Republicans were <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6rz4s037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much likelier than Democrats</a> to say they were certain to vote in the election. How does a Republican win in a solid-blue state like California? In a very low-turnout scenario where most Democrats abstain from voting. But that seems increasingly less likely, based on data on who has voted so far. According to the California firm <a href="https://www.politicaldata.com/2021-special-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political Data, Inc.</a>, 7,799,192 mail ballots have already been returned, 52 percent of which were cast by registered Democrats, 25 percent of which were cast by registered Republicans and 23 percent of which were cast by unaffiliated voters. Please, please <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-read-too-much-into-early-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t read too much</a> into these numbers — there’s no guarantee that registered Democrats are voting against the recall (or registered Republicans for it), and in-person voters will likely be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-absentee-voting-looked-like-in-all-50-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately Republican</a>. Still, it sure doesn’t look like Democrats have an enthusiasm problem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">California’s base partisanship is one reason why this recall looks unlikely to follow the pattern of the one in 2003, when Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was recalled by <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2003&amp;fips=6&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0&amp;minper=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 points</a>. The Golden State is simply much bluer than it was 18 years ago. John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, won California by just <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2004&amp;fips=6&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0Fewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 points</a>, but President Biden carried it by <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=6&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 points</a> last year. And, crucially, while there has been some grumbling over Newsom’s governorship (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-31/newsom-covid-19-criticism-democrats-allies-possible-recall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even from Democrats</a>), he’s nowhere near as unpopular as Davis was in 2003. As the chart below shows, Newsom’s approval rating has hovered around 50 percent among likely voters in surveys conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California in the leadup to the recall, whereas the same pollster found Davis below 30 percent approval among the likely electorate before the 2003 recall contest.</p>

</div></figure><div>
<p></p><h2>The replacement election</h2>
</div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Should a majority of voters choose to recall Newsom, the ballot’s second question would then come into play: Who should replace Newsom? Out of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-04/california-governor-recall-election-candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 candidates on the ballot</a>, the winner would simply be the one with the most votes, no matter how small a percentage of the vote they have. And the way things are shaping up, the winner of the replacement vote will fall <em>well</em> short of a majority — and likely get far fewer votes than Newsom does on the first question, even if the recall succeeds. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican Larry Elder, a <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/2021/08/newsom-recall-candidates-larry-elder-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative radio talk-show host</a>, has a clear lead (despite <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/kfile-larry-elder-sexual-harassment-allegations/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegations of sexual harassment</a> and his ex-fiancée’s claims that he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/19/elders-ex-fiancee-said-he-brandished-a-gun-at-her-506286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brandished a gun at her</a> during an argument), but he is polling at just shy of 28 percent in FiveThirtyEight’s tracker, well ahead of Democrat and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-03/kevin-paffrath-youtube-star-democrat-recall-candidate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube celebrity</a> Kevin Paffrath, who is at 7 percent, and two other Republicans, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and 2018 GOP gubernatorial nominee John Cox, who are both right around 5 percent.</p>



<figure><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/california-recall-polls/"><img loading="lazy" width="2058" height="984" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-2-recall-0912.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-2-recall-0912.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-2-recall-0912.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca-2-recall-0912.jpg?w=1400 2x"></a></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Now, when push comes to shove, Elder might win more than 28 percent because the pool of voters who cast a replacement vote (the second question) could be notably smaller than the recall electorate (the first question), so Elder’s vote total might represent a bigger slice of that smaller pie. That’s because many Democratic-leaning voters may skip the second question in response to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-09/newsom-wants-voters-to-skip-the-recall-ballots-second-part-they-dont-have-to" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicit encouragement from Newsom’s campaign</a> to vote “no” on recall and not to cast <em>any </em>vote for a replacement candidate. Additionally, there aren’t any high-profile Democrats running to attract Democratic-leaning voters, because <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/california-s-recall-democrats-would-rather-not-have-backup-plan-n1268182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state party discouraged</a> big names from running so that Newsom’s recall would be less palatable. In a <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2021/9_8_2021_ca_statewide_marginals_a_pdftxt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University poll</a> released last week, 44 percent of likely voters said they would leave the second question blank, including 61 percent of Democrats compared with only 14 percent of Republicans. As a result, Elder attracted 39 percent of the likely voters who said they would cast a replacement vote, but that worked out to only 18 percent of all likely recall voters. In 2003, there were about 4 percent fewer votes cast for the replacement candidates than on the recall question, but it seems likely the undervote will be much larger this time around.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even if Elder’s vote share does end up being higher than 28 percent, it’s clear there is no 2021 replacement candidate with the kind of broad support Arnold Schwarzenegger attracted in 2003, <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2003&amp;fips=6&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0&amp;minper=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when he won the vote</a> to replace Davis with about 49 percent in a <em>135-candidate</em> field. In fact, because of the unusual recall-replacement format, Elder could win with the lowest vote share of any elected governor in modern times. As the chart below shows, over the past half century or so under any electoral format, no governor has won with less than 30 percent of the vote -- a feat Elder could conceivably accomplish if Newsom is recalled.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="No one has won a U.S. governorship with under 30%" aria-label="chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DyHRO/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="477" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The lowest vote share for an elected governor dating back to 1968 was 33 percent, which then-Democrat Buddy Roemer garnered to win Louisiana’s all-party primary for governor in 1987, as fellow Democrat Edwin Edwards <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1987/10/26/edwards-cuts-his-losses/58bba235-c2d5-40e1-8bc2-fbdec9612688/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined to contest a runoff against Roemer</a> after no candidate won a majority.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roemer switched parties to become a Republican during his subsequent term in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> In a regular general election, the lowest win percentage was 35 percent, which Angus King won in <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1994&amp;fips=23&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maine’s 1994 gubernatorial race</a> as an independent. And if Elder were to win with 30 percent or less, he’d actually have the lowest winner’s vote share in any gubernatorial race since 1900, surpassing Democrat Ernest Lister’s 31 percent in <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/results_report.aspx?e=125&amp;c=&amp;c2=&amp;t=&amp;t2=&amp;p=&amp;p2=&amp;y=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington’s 1912 election</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve spent so much time looking ahead to the recall election itself that not a lot of ink has been spilled about what the result could mean for the future of California — and national — politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Newsom is recalled (or even if the recall does better than expected), Republicans will undoubtedly claim they have the momentum going into the 2022 midterms. It’s unclear, though, how predictive a gubernatorial recall election is of future elections. True, if one party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently overperforms</a> in special elections for Congress, it usually means that party will do well in the next November election. But the result of a <em>single</em> special election should <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-special-election-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never be overinterpreted</a>; there might have been local issues at play or extenuating circumstances that made that one race a poor bellwether for the nation as a whole. And recall elections are especially prone to extenuating circumstances since something seismic and unusual must have happened to get them on the ballot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plus, special elections for Congress are federal elections, meaning partisanship plays a bigger role in how people vote; by contrast, it’s not unheard of for a state to elect a governor from the party opposite to how it usually votes in presidential races. And there is such a small sample of gubernatorial recall elections in U.S. history that it’s impossible to know whether they have any predictive power, anyway. The 2003 recall of Davis possibly foreshadowed a good 2004 election for Republicans — the 51 percent of the national popular vote that then-President George W. Bush received is still the highest for a Republican in over 30 years — but former Gov. Scott Walker’s victory in the June 2012 recall election in Wisconsin didn’t presage then-President Barack Obama’s reelection victory later that year, in which he carried Wisconsin by <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2012&amp;fips=55&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 points</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Electoral impacts aside, the recall result could really matter in terms of policy. If Elder were to become governor, that would surely have ramifications for the state’s response to COVID-19 and its politics more broadly. Most immediately, directives from the governor’s office on battling the coronavirus could shift sharply away from the status quo. Elder <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-recall-larry-elder-repeal-mask-vaccine-mandates-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has promised</a> to repeal Newsom’s mask and vaccine mandates if he wins, and he’s also <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/larry-elder-dismisses-covid-19-175827910.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed opposition</a> to having young people get vaccinated or wear masks in school. This comes despite a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I50LLKPg-nOZdhn8Qa7zziU3i1MZl3SD/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov survey last month</a> that found around two-thirds of Californians backed vaccine mandates for health workers and even employees of private businesses.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, <a href="https://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/c.php?g=275786&amp;p=6904274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California governors can</a> fill vacancies in state courts and in various executive departments. As such, Elder could try to appoint conservative justices to California’s courts and place conservative officials in state government. He would also have line-item veto power on appropriations bills, which could enable Elder to seek funding cuts for programs he doesn’t support. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, a Gov. Elder <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-09-03/california-recall-larry-elder-governor-powerless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have limitless power</a> to reshape California in his image. Most importantly, Democrats still have supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature, meaning they would be able to override his vetoes of any bills they want to pass. And any judges Elder appoints would have to be confirmed by the state’s Commission on Judicial Appointments. Finally, an Elder governorship might not last long because the office will be on the ballot again in November 2022. Given California’s blue hue, it’s very possible that, even if Newsom is recalled, the state will have a Democratic governor again in just 16 months.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s one lurking and potentially momentous appointment that Elder could make without being overruled: <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate637302453.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filling a vacancy in the U.S. Senate</a>. It’s not hard to construct a scenario in which an Elder victory could lead to a power shift in Washington, either, since Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/F000062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is 88 years old</a> and the chamber is currently divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote giving Democrats a narrow hold on power. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-elder-dianne-feinstein-replace-republican-california-recall-election-senate-2021-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elder pledged to appoint a Republican</a> in Feinstein’s place (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/upshot/democrats-agenda-hinges-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should her seat become vacant</a>), which would give Republicans a 51-49 edge in the Senate. How long Elder would even have this power is hard to say, though, as Democrats could use their supermajorities in the state legislature to change the state’s Senate vacancy rules to prevent this scenario from happening.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, one consequence of the recall election — regardless of the result — could be alterations to the recall process itself. It’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-california-became-the-recall-capital-of-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easier for recalls to succeed</a> in California than in any other state, and it wouldn’t be surprising if the Democratic legislature tries to amend state law to discourage this from happening again. (It <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/15/california-democrats-use-budget-bill-to-change-recall-election-rules-help-colleague/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn’t be the first time</a> that Democrats <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Demcocratic-lawmakers-vote-to-speed-up-Newsom-16280554.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manipulated California’s recall process</a> for their own attempted political benefit.) There is public support for this, too: According to a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/b1h1g2vgfh/recall_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Hoover Institute/Bill Lane Center for the American West poll</a> of the recall from a couple weeks ago, a plurality of Californians favor several reforms to the recall process, including raising the number of signatures required to trigger an election, increasing the filing requirements for replacement candidates and requiring a specific reason to recall a governor.</p>

Just don’t expect to learn the result on Tuesday night: Since the election is being conducted predominantly by mail, it’s going to take several days to count all the votes, just like it did in the 2020 presidential election. Last year, California counted only about two-thirds of its votes on election night, with the rest trickling in over the next several days. The state didn’t even hit 95 percent reporting until 11 days after Election Day.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It likely won’t take as long this time, since the deadline for ballots to be received is <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/statewide-elections/2021-recall/key-dates-deadlines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one week</a> after the election (in 2020, it was <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/#CA-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 days</a> after), but you should still be prepared to wait multiple days for a winner to be declared if the election is at all close.

			<title>Why It Was So Easy To Get Gavin Newsom’s Recall On The Ballot In California</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">California leads the nation in efforts to recall members of its government, but there’s no single reason for this — in fact, there are four. First, practically every public official in the state is eligible for recall. In addition, a recall petition can be triggered for any reason. California doesn’t require as many signatures as other states either, and it allows petitions to circulate longer. All these factors combine to make California’s recall process one of the most lenient in the country.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1416" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Gavin Newsom is the latest governor to face a recall attempt in the state, but he’s hardly the first. Everyone who has served as governor of California in the past 60 years has faced at least one attempted recall. But Newsom is part of a much more exclusive club with next Tuesday’s election: Qualifying a recall for the ballot is still rare, but California has seen more recalls of state legislators and governors qualify than any other state. Of the 29 recall elections for state legislators that have taken place in the U.S., nine have been in California, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials.aspx#Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>. And after Sept. 14, two of the nation’s four gubernatorial recall elections will have taken place in California.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The state’s recall procedure was enacted as a constitutional amendment over a century ago. As a Progressive Era reform, the recall — along with the initiative and the referendum, two hallmarks of California’s legislate-by-ballot system — was intended to strengthen the electorate’s power over its government. A California state senator was recalled in 1913, and with that, the recall was off to the races: There have been 178 subsequent attempts to recall elected state officials. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s been some futzing around the margins,<a data-footnote-id="41" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-41" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, for example, Californians voted to increase the amount of time between the certification of signatures and the recall election itself from 60-80 days to up to 180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>41</sup></a> but the basic mechanism for the recall of a statewide officer hasn’t changed much over the years. (Though state legislators <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SCA3https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SCA3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tried</a>, and are <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB660" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certainly</a> <a href="http://california%20leads%20the%20nation%20in%20efforts%20to%20recall%20members%20of%20its%20government,%20but%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20single%20reason%20for%20this%20--%20in%20fact,%20there%20are%20four.%20first,%20practically%20every%20public%20official%20in%20the%20state%20is%20eligible%20for%20recall.%20in%20addition,%20a%20recall%20petition%20can%20be%20triggered%20for%20any%20reason.%20california%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20require%20as%20many%20signatures%20as%20other%20states%20either,%20and%20it%20allows%20petitions%20to%20circulate%20longer.%20all%20these%20factors%20combine%20to%20make%20california%E2%80%99s%20recall%20process%20one%20of%20the%20most%20lenient%20in%20the%20country.%20insert%20chart%201%20gavin%20newsom%20is%20the%20latest%20governor%20to%20face%20a%20recall%20attempt%20in%20the%20state,%20but%20he%E2%80%99s%20hardly%20the%20first.%20everyone%20who%20has%20served%20as%20governor%20of%20california%20in%20the%20past%2060%20years%20has%20faced%20at%20least%20one%20attempted%20recall.%20though%20he%E2%80%99s%20part%20of%20a%20much%20more%20exclusive%20club%20with%20next%20tuesday%E2%80%99s%20election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still trying</a>.) Citizens bring a petition for recall to the secretary of state; they collect signatures; and if the number of certified signatures exceeds a minimum threshold, a recall election is triggered.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What makes California rife with recalls? First, all <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 states</a><a data-footnote-id="42" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-42" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, D.C. Recalling a mayor doesn’t count for the purposes of our story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>42</sup></a> with official recall processes allow the recall of a governor, but only four — including California — hold nearly all public offices eligible for recall. Many states restrict recalls to include only elected positions or specific offices, or exclude certain judges from recall attempts. No public official serving the state of California is immune, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/us/politics/judge-persky-brock-turner-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful recall of Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky</a> in 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Secondly, California does not limit the grounds for recall. If, say, someone isn’t a fan of the state Supreme Court, that empowered resident could file 18 petitions to recall nine different justices in two years.<a data-footnote-id="43" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-43" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This actually happened between 1986 and 1988. No petition successfully qualified for the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>43</sup></a> With no required burden of proof, the first step to getting a recall on the ballot is as easy as filing some paperwork — unlike in some other states, which require an indictment or criminal conviction before a recall can even be considered.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="942" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Third, the state has a fairly low signature threshold. A petitioner seeking to recall a statewide official needs to collect signatures equal to 12 percent of the last vote for office (it’s a little higher for state legislators and judges), plus signatures equal to 1 percent of the last vote from at least five of California’s 58 counties. Compared with the other two states that require a geographic distribution of signatures, California’s threshold is relatively low. Georgia requires the recall position to have a minimum number of signatures from each of its 14 congressional districts, and Illinois requires signatures from at least 25 of its 102 counties.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">To trigger a recall election for Newsom, petitioners had to collect fewer than 1.5 million signatures, a drop in a state where more than 12.7 million people voted in the last gubernatorial election. Compare that with a state like Michigan, which would require signatures equivalent to 25 percent of the 4.3 million votes cast in 2018 to put a gubernatorial recall on its ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which brings us to the fourth reason it is comparatively easier for Californians to get a recall on the ballot. Out of the 19 states with recall processes, only four prescribe a circulation period longer than five months.<a data-footnote-id="44" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-44" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Alaska nor North Dakota has a mandatory circulation period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>45</sup></a> the majority of states limit that period to three months or less.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">I was in my eighth grade classroom in a small town in Ontario, Canada, when suddenly there was a flurry of activity in the hallway. An instructor popped her head in the door, her face drained of color, and beckoned our teacher out of the room. Soon after, all of the seventh and eighth graders — deemed old enough to understand the gravity of the situation —  were ushered into a classroom where we watched a grainy broadcast of the news. The first plane had flown into the World Trade Center in New York City. We were sent home early. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are so few moments in history that call for the question “Where were you when you heard the news?” But the Sept. 11 attacks are undoubtedly one, and most Americans can answer that question without missing a beat. Earlier this month, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/hlzpfslijb/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov asked Americans if they could remember where they were,</a> and 81 percent said they could. In a separate poll, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/02/two-decades-later-the-enduring-legacy-of-9-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center found</a> that 93 percent of adults age 30 and over could remember. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past two decades, as pollsters have surveyed Americans on issues around terrorism and the 9/11 attacks in particular, much of the sentiment has remained consistent, a pattern identified in <a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2021-08/mueller-public-opinion-on-war-and-terror-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a white paper published in August</a> by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. In a review of public opinion polling since the 9/11 attacks, John Mueller, a senior fellow at Cato and a political scientist at Ohio State University, found that much of the public’s opinions about terrorism and safety have remained steady for two decades. In some cases, concerns spiked immediately following the attacks, then declined slightly before staying static for years. In other cases, the rates of concern never declined. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“These findings are rather surprising because there is reason to have expected that concerns and anxieties about terrorism would erode over time,” Mueller wrote. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/911-era-political-consensus-impossible-days-79884213</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">For example, Americans have remained convinced that a terrorist attack is likely. A series of polls from The Economist/YouGov conducted from 2013 to 2021<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouGov also posed this question in 2009. Also, four of the polls we analyzed were conducted by YouGov alone, without sponsorship of The Economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> asked what Americans think are the chances of a terrorist attack in the U.S. in the next 12 months. Those who thought an attack was “very” or “somewhat” likely rarely dipped below 50 percent and often spiked following major terrorist attacks in the U.S. or Europe. (Any time the responses rose about 70 percent, it was following a major attack.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, Pew’s annual survey of policy priorities has found <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/02/two-decades-later-the-enduring-legacy-of-9-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans rank terrorism</a> at or near the top of the list year over year. As recently as 2020, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/02/13/as-economic-concerns-recede-environmental-protection-rises-on-the-publics-policy-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74 percent of Americans</a> said defending against terrorism should be a top priority for the president and Congress, making it the number-one policy issue. Even in 2021, as the pandemic altered priorities, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/01/28/economy-and-covid-19-top-the-publics-policy-agenda-for-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63 percent of Americans</a> still rated terrorism as their top issue, making it fourth overall, behind the pandemic, the economy and jobs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans also consistently say that 9/11 has had a lasting impact on this country. In <a href="https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/f1bf1e6c-a24d-4d52-a616-e05e09e6ce62/note/4f0fba7c-bb95-420e-b30e-9ddfd9f526fd.#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post/ABC News polls</a> from 2001, 2002, 2011 and 2021, the proportion of Americans who said the attacks “changed this country in a lasting way” has never fallen below 83 percent,  with 86 percent saying so in a survey conducted within the past month. Notably, though, the feelings on whether this is a change for the better or worse has shifted: In 2002, 67 percent of Americans said that the 9/11 attacks changed America for the better. That number has declined since, with only 33 percent saying so in 2021. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That 9/11 still rests so heavily on our collective consciousness is no surprise. For those of us who lived through it, we just have to cast our minds back to that day. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Abortion rights remain top of mind for many Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/">in the wake of the Supreme Court</a> allowing a Texas law that effectively bans abortions in the state to go into effect.

Overall, 6 percent of voters said this was their top issue after the decision, compared with 4 percent before, while support among Democrats doubled, fueled by a 6-percentage-point jump among Democratic women.</li><li>Canada and Germany are heading to the polls to vote for new leaders and parliaments this month. In Germany, the center-left Social Democratic Party is leading the polls, sitting at an average of 25 percent, ahead of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party), at 21 percent, according to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/">Politico’s poll tracker</a>. And in Canada, the center-right Conservative Party has edged ahead of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party, with their respective polling averages at 33.5 percent and 31.6 percent, according to <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/">CBC’s poll tracker</a>. However, the Liberals are still favored to win the most seats — though another minority government is likely, regardless of who wins. </li><li>Though <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-end-of-the-afghanistan-war-and-bidens-handling-of-it-so-far/">Americans overall have somewhat mixed feelings</a> about the decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, when you ask Americans who were deployed in that war, there’s a higher level of consensus. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/09/afghanistan-war-veterans-polling/">An Aug. 17-Sept. 2 Morning Consult poll of veterans</a> of the war in Afghanistan found 58 percent supported President Biden’s decision to withdraw troops, with 53 percent still supporting the decision even if the Taliban is in control of Afghanistan, and 53 percent supporting even if it creates an opportunity for terrorists in Afghanistan. </li><li>The decision to get vaccinated against COVID-19 has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-arent-new-to-the-anti-vaxx-movement/">become an increasingly partisan</a> issue in the U.S., and it can sometimes make for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/03/08/vaccine-anti-vax-anti-vaxxer-what-change-their-mind-vaccine-hesitancy/3100216002/">some cognitive dissonance</a> between a person’s political identity and their personal health choices: <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/secret-vaxxers-these-americans-are-getting-covid-vaccinations-but-not-telling-anyone/">A Harris/USA Today</a> poll conducted between Aug. 27-29 found that 11 percent of vaccinated Americans said they would keep their vaccination a secret from some people, and 6 percent said they didn’t plan to tell anyone.

Personally, I think that’s fine, but if you steal hotel towels, I’m judging you. Not because it’s morally wrong, but because why would you want a towel used by 5,000 other people?</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">At first glance, Melissa<a data-footnote-id="46" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-46" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa is not her real name. She requested a pseudonym because she is concerned her beliefs will create backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>46</sup></a> seems to meet all the criteria of the “crunchy granola” type. She tracks ingredients on all the products she buys and uses apps to identify anything that isn’t “clean.” She says she considers herself vaccine-hesitant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m not against vaccines for everyone,” she wrote to me in a Facebook Messenger chat. “[But] I’m very distrustful of pharmaceutical companies and that is the main reason I am hesitant about vaccines for myself and my family.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But she’s not exactly left-wing. A nurse-midwife student in Nebraska, Melissa said she’s libertarian, and while there are ideas on the left and right she agrees with, her main political position is that “the government shouldn’t be regulating things that don’t hurt others.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The modern anti-vaccination movement in America has <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/06/the-anti-vax-movements-radical-shift-from-crunchy-granola-purists-to-far-right-crusaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often been associated</a> with a stereotype of left-wing, coastal, white, wealthy moms — those “crunchy granola” types. In recent years, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, spurred by low vaccination rates in children, emerged in wealthy, liberal places like <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/20/whooping-cough-cases-spike-again-in-marin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marin County, California</a>, and <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/some-families-make-controversial-decision-not-to-vaccinate-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boulder, Colorado</a>. But while the public narrative focused on these left-wing enclaves, they were far from the only regions affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease: <a href="https://khn.org/news/why-measles-hits-so-hard-within-n-y-orthodox-jewish-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conservative communities of Orthodox Jews</a>, some of whom also reject vaccines, have also seen spikes in cases, for example. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/Health/video/covid-19-vaccines-work-74654465</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And polls over the past two decades have consistently found Republicans are just as likely as Democrats to hold vaccine-hesitant views. So while the right-wing resistance to the COVID-19 vaccines may feel like an about-face for who is anti-vax in America, both sides of the political divide were always there — but now one side’s fringe views have slipped into its mainstream. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Vaccine refusal has always been a place where left meets right,” said Jennifer Reich, a sociology professor at the University of Colorado and the author of “Calling the Shots: Why Parents Reject Vaccines.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though anti-vaxxers have been around as long as vaccines, the modern anti-vaccination movement really emerged after the 1998 publication of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/lancet-retracts-mmr-paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an infamous and since-retracted study</a> in The Lancet that falsely claimed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine caused autism. In the years that followed — spurred partly by support from <a href="https://www.insider.com/jenny-mccarthy-became-the-face-of-the-anti-vaxx-movement-2019-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy</a> — a new era of vaccine fears began, with small but fierce <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/01/30/84-of-kindergartners-not-up-to-date-on-vaccines-at-a-marin-school-majority-of-students-unprotected-at-some-private-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cohorts of parents refusing to vaccinate</a> their children. And polling has consistently shown those small cohorts included Americans on the left and the right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take a series of polls from Gallup, conducted in 2001, 2015 and 2019. Each time, Gallup asked respondents the same questions about vaccines, and while there was always anti-vaccine representation across the political spectrum, the most recent poll showed a spike in the adoption of anti-vaccine views among Republicans and independents. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Republicans and independents are increasingly anti-vaxx" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/C63Yn/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="233" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">When asked how important it is that parents vaccinate their children, very few or no respondents said it was “not very” or “not at all” important in earlier surveys. But in 2019, 8 percent of Republicans, 8 percent of independents and 2 percent of Democrats said it was “not very” or “not at all” important that parents vaccinate their kids. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which side of the political aisle was <em>more</em> anti-vaccine really depends on the question and the poll. In <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/63g3p232e0/tabs_Vaccines_0716172013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2013 YouGov poll</a>, 11 percent of Democrats, 14 percent of independents and 9 percent of Republicans said they believe vaccines cause autism. But in <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/rat7jsde5z/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2017 YouGov poll</a>, 19 percent of Democrats, 31 percent of independents and 39 percent of Republicans said it was “definitely” or “probably” true that vaccines cause autism. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/02/09/83-percent-say-measles-vaccine-is-safe-for-healthy-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 Pew Research Center poll</a> found 9 percent of Democrats, 10 percent of independents and 5 percent of Republicans thought the MMR vaccine was unsafe. And in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-on-vaccines-and-the-measles-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2015 CBS poll</a>, when asked whether parents should be required to vaccinate their kids or should be able to decide for themselves, 38 percent of Republicans, 34 percent of independents and 23 percent of Democrats said parents should be able to make their own choice. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked about vaccine safety, Republicans and Democrats express vaccine-hesitant beliefs at roughly the same rate. But when asked about government mandates, Republicans are much more likely to take the vaccine-hesitant stance, according to Allan McCoy, a sociology professor at State University of New York. In a 2018 study published in Critical Public Health<em>, </em>McCoy compared two Pew Center surveys on vaccine beliefs. He found that the more ideologically extreme a respondent was — regardless of whether they’re on the left or right —  the more likely they were to think that vaccines are unsafe. But when asked if vaccines should be compulsory or left up to parents, respondents who identified as “very conservative” were 136 percent more likely than “moderates” to think it should be a parent’s choice, while those who were “liberal” and “very liberal”  were 44 percent and 13 percent <em>less</em> likely to think so, respectively. Democrats and Republicans are almost equally likely to hold anti-vaccine beliefs, but Republicans in particular <em>also</em> tend to be against vaccine mandates.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But if vaccine hesitancy before the pandemic was relatively bipartisan, vaccine hesitancy around the COVID-19 vaccine has been anything but. Polls and vaccination rates <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-is-growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have shown Republicans are less likely to be vaccinated</a>, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/03/05/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-plan-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-or-already-have/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to say they don’t plan to get the shot</a> than Democrats. Shana Kushner Gadarian, a political science professor at Syracuse University, and her colleagues have been conducting a panel survey of 3,000 Americans for the past 18 months. Gadarian told me there has been a partisan split on all health behaviors (not only the vaccine but also mask wearing, hand washing, visiting one’s doctor) throughout the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Partisanship is not the sole determinant, but it is the strongest, most consistent determinant, even controlling for age, education, where people are living, how many COVID-19 cases are in the area,” Gadarian said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This split over the COVID-19 vaccine reflects <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/17/politics-is-wrecking-americas-pandemic-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the politicization of the entire pandemic</a>, but what does it mean for the demographics of the anti-vaxx movement beyond COVID-19? Experts I spoke to said it’s too early to tell, and so far there hasn’t been enough recent polling on non-COVID-19 vaccine beliefs to be definitive. In <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/xj7rpmvws8/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July 2019 YouGov poll</a>, for instance, 14 percent of Democrats, 21 percent of independents and 28 percent of Republicans said it’s “definitely” or “probably” true that vaccines have been shown to cause autism. When YouGov <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/w2zmwpzsq0/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posed the same question this past July</a>, 11 percent of Democrats, 18 percent of independents and 27 percent of Republicans said so. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a chance some left-wing anti-vaxxers will second-guess their stance given the sudden embrace of anti-vaccine positions on the right. But Reich, who studied vaccine-hesitant parents for years, said they typically don’t identify as “anti-vaccine,” per se, and feel more strongly about their ideals — like that a parent is the best person to make decisions about their child’s health — than their identity. So having Republicans espousing similar beliefs won’t feel like a challenge for left-wing parents, necessarily. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, it’s possible that Republican resistance to the COVID-19 vaccine could mutate into vaccine hesitancy more generally, if one’s political identity demands resistance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m worried that the politicization could threaten the social consensus [currently] in favor of vaccination,” said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. “If we start to see attitudes towards vaccines become closely linked to partisanship and ideology, we could see a polarization over vaccination that would threaten herd immunity on a whole series of diseases over time.”  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From her point of view, Melissa said the idea that Republicans may become more broadly vaccine hesitant isn’t just a hypothesis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I know for a fact, based on a group chat I am in, that some Republicans are reevaluating their stance on all vaccines,” she wrote.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It didn’t take long for prominent voices on the political right to begin stoking fears about Afghan citizens fleeing the Taliban’s takeover of the country and coming to the United States.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/aug/25/how-are-afghan-refugees-being-vetted-heres-what-we/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaccurately</a> <a href="https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that there’s “NO VETTING” of these evacuees, <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-zuqbqd4mun579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking</a>, “How many terrorists will Joe Biden bring to America?” “Hillbilly Elegy” author and 2022 Ohio senatorial candidate J.D. Vance <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1429835612341874691" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similarly suggested</a> that the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/amid-afghanistan-chaos-refugee-vetting-process-sound-opinion/story?id=79689151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ostensibly insufficient</a> screening of Afghans would result in the U.S. harboring “a bunch of people who believe they should blow themselves up in a mall because someone looked at their wife the wrong way.” Afghan refugees have been frequently depicted as <a href="https://www.vox.com/22634047/afghanistan-refugees-tucker-carlson-housing-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic</a>, <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/stephen-miller-suggests-afghan-refugees-dont-deserve-to-come-to-us-may-not-be-pro-american-or-embrace-our-way-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ted-cruz-poor-vetting-afghanistan-refugees-invitation-terror-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national security</a> threats on Fox News too, with Tucker Carlson even branding efforts to relocate Afghan evacuees in the U.S. as “<a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/tucker-carlson-calls-effort-to-evacuate-afghan-refugees-to-u-s-operation-change-america-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Change America Forever</a>.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This fear-mongering is neither surprising nor new. There’s a <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/America_for_Americans/rI2LDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=refugee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long history</a> of politicians <a href="https://www.oecd.org/migration/refugees-are-not-a-burden-but-an-opportunity.htm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">erroneously representing</a> refugees as <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaq0883" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic burdens</a> who pose cultural and/or national security threats to the U.S. In fact, the same arguments against Afghan asylum seekers were also <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/06/15/482184991/fact-check-donald-trump-and-syrian-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed</a> in 2015 and 2016 against resettling Syrian refugees displaced by their country’s civil war. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump regularly railed against the refugee policies of then-President Barack Obama’s administration, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/21/full-text-donald-trumps-prepared-remarks-accepting-the-republican-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proclaiming</a> at the Republican National Convention, “We don’t want them in our country.” Trump’s administration made this point even clearer, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/38781496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning Syrian refugees</a> and cutting the total number of refugees allowed in the U.S. by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-politics-virus-outbreak-immigration-immigration-policy-1f8c91e31fba158126f8e91c1453b13f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 80 percent</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those policies reflect the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/u-s-public-seldom-has-welcomed-refugees-into-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically strong strain of anti-asylum sentiment</a> in American public opinion. Searching through the Roper Center’s database of <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/search?collection=LSM&amp;q=refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling questions on “refugees”</a> since the 1930s reveals that Americans have rarely supported asylum for forcibly displaced migrants seeking safe-haven in the U.S.<a data-footnote-id="45" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-45" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one exception is when &lt;a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/study/31088773/questions#07cd6c18-15ce-4737-9f06-73f4127c39d9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;66 percent supported&lt;/a&gt; the Clinton administration’s decision to bring a relatively small number of ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo to the U.S. in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>45</sup></a> Nearly two-thirds <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/17/what-americans-thought-of-jewish-refugees-on-the-eve-of-world-war-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposed admitting 10,000 Jewish children</a> into the U.S., who were fleeing Nazism in 1939. Even after the horrors of the Holocaust were further exposed in the post-war period, only 27 percent of respondents in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wvckuwfe4w4b48x/gallup1946.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1946 Gallup poll</a> supported a proposed “plan to require each nation to take in a given number of Jewish and other European refugees,” compared with 59 percent who disapproved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The public’s opposition to resettling refugees in the U.S. persisted throughout the 20th century. Polling from the late 1970s, for example, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qyx0470zx9k3wu1/Gallup1979.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently</a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c99u50uf7p41kt3/NYT1979.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> that most Americans <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5tsb28nu2l49p9s/harris1977.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposed admitting thousands of refugees from Southeast Asia</a> in the Vietnam War’s aftermath. While support can vary by question-wording, majorities also opposed <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/llxyhtu7mv1m0bs/gallup1958.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepting Hungarian refugees in the 1950s</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cci2npz8wcybg79/nyt1980.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuban refugees in the 1980s</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hji7ymuomm2dqrl/nyt1994.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haitian refugees in the 1990s</a>. The same pattern once again emerged in 2015, when <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2015/11/bloomberg-poll-majority-of-americans-would-reject-syrian-refugees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/09/15/poll-results-syrian-refugee-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> that <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/09/14/few-americans-want-take-more-syrian-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few Americans wanted</a> to take in refugees escaping the civil war in Syria. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But public opinion on immigration issues has changed a lot since then. Americans generally became more supportive of immigration in <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/5/17527734/trump-immigration-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">response to the Trump administration’s restrictive policies</a> — a well-documented dynamic in U.S. politics where <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public opinion tends to move against the president’s positions</a>. As part of that overall shift, Americans’ views of refugees shifted in the same direction. Support for accepting Muslim refugees from Syria increased in The Economist/YouGovsurveys from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/o77ie8jgv3/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 percent in November 2015</a> to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/qs45iqlax3/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent in April 2017</a>. Quinnipiac University Poll showed a similar 12-point increase in support for admitting Syrian refugees over the same 16-month time period (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/20/poll-syrian-refugees-united-states-237406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43 percent to 55 percent respectively</a>); and the share of Americans saying the “U.S. has a responsibility to accept Syrian refugees” in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/02-16-17-Political-release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center polling</a> rose from 40 percent in October 2016 to 47 in February 2017. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/11/24/u-s-public-opinion-on-refugee-admission-is-more-favorable-than-current-immigration-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing public support for refugees in the Trump era</a> extended beyond the Syrian civil war. Indeed, the percentage of Americans who said that taking in civilian refugees who are trying to escape violence should be a very or somewhat important goal of U.S. immigration policy increased by double digits in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FT_19.11.12_immigration_topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew polls</a> fielded in December 2016 and September 2019 (61 percent to 72 percent, respectively). Meanwhile, the share of HuffPost/YouGov respondents who said “the U.S. does not have a responsibility to take in refugees fleeing from other countries” decreased from <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/syrian-refugee-poll_n_55f83d62e4b0c2077efc16c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent in 2015</a> to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vkgjbt5pv0/tabs_HP_Refugees_20190709.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42 percent in 2019</a>. And 2019 polls conducted by <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/264785/support-allowing-border-refugees-edges.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dnmp4n4fl2rc4wf/cnn2019.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-july-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> all showed majority support for accepting Central American refugees into the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The more welcoming context is one important reason why we’re now seeing stronger support for Afghan refugees than previous asylum seekers. Despite that high-profile fear-mongering, early polling on the issue shows relatively weak opposition to resettling Afghans in the U.S. The majority of voters in an August<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/25/afghanistan-withdrawal-relocation-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> supported relocating Afghan refugees in the U.S., while just one-third were opposed. Support was even stronger in the latest <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/aug-29-sept-1-2021-washington-post-abc-news-poll/899d77db-ef60-46c9-b028-8f3298df8659/?itid=lk_inline_manual_45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post/ABC News poll</a>, where 68 percent strongly or somewhat favored the U.S. taking in Afghan refugees after security screenings. And Americans are especially supportive of Afghans who helped U.S. forces during the 20-year war, with a whopping 81-percent of those surveyed by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJKdBglH8nPNslg4duYhtV1fuTcoWF4w/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/CBS News</a> saying we should help Afghans who worked with American troops come to the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That strong sense of obligation toward Afghans who’ve helped us has also sharply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/us/politics/republicans-afghan-refugees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divided Republican politicians</a>. While some of the loudest conservative voices in the country are now stoking fears of Afghan refugees, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/afghan-refugees-republicans/2021/08/18/3592aaa0-005e-11ec-825d-01701f9ded64_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republican politicians</a> have argued that we have a moral obligation to accept them into the U.S. — especially Afghans who directly helped American efforts over the past two decades. This includes <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-afghan-refugees_n_612d2b6ee4b0f562f3e128ef?l6q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several Republican governors</a> who’ve already agreed to accept Afghan refugees into their states.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The schism within the GOP makes it all the more difficult to mobilize public opinion against Afghan refugees. When party leaders are unified on an issue, their supporters <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo11644533.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to adopt those same positions</a>. But the mixed messages on this issue make it difficult to galvanize the same unified opposition that rank-and-file Republicans have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly shown toward President Biden’s other immigration policies</a>. This could change, of course, as moderate voices in the GOP have often been drowned out by the Trumpian wing of the party, and, as mentioned, public opinion tends to move against the president’s positions — it’s Biden, not Trump, in the White House now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But so long as several prominent Republicans feel obliged to accept Afghan evacuees, it will be harder for right-wing fear-mongering to change the country’s consistently strong support for Afghan refugees seeking asylum in the U.S.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It took <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/texas-gop-voting-cusp-governor-79749334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several months</a>, but Texas Republicans have finally enacted their much-debated bill rolling back voting access in the Lone Star State. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back in the spring, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/29/texas-voting-restrictions-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disagreements</a> between Senate and House Republicans delayed the final vote on the proposal until the last day of Texas’s regular legislative session, making it easy for Democrats to kill that bill by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/30/texas-voting-restrictions-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the capitol early that day</a>, since the Texas Legislature requires a two-thirds quorum in order to hold a vote. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott then <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/22/texas-greg-abbott-special-session/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called a special session</a> for July, in part specifically to pass the voting restrictions, but state House Democrats paralyzed it by fleeing the state in order to prevent the bill’s passage. However, Abbott simply <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/02/greg-abbott-texas-special-legislative-session/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called yet another special session</a> to start immediately after the first ended, and after nearly six weeks away, enough Democrats <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/18/texas-house-democrats-quorum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to the state</a> to allow legislative business to continue. The controversial elections bill <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/31/texas-republicans-dem-delays-election-508063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally passed</a> the legislature late last month — though not before a 15-hour talking filibuster in the Senate and an impassioned 12-hour debate in the House — and Abbott <a href="https://abc13.com/texas-politics-senate-bill-1-signed-into-law-when-does-sb1-start/11005841/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed it into law</a> on Tuesday. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Texas law is likely the culmination of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-states-where-efforts-to-restrict-voting-are-escalating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large-scale Republican push</a> to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-have-made-it-harder-to-vote-in-11-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrict voting access</a> this spring and summer — the policy byproduct of former President Donald Trump’s unfounded claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent. At this point in the year, most state legislatures are now <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/2021-state-legislative-session-calendar.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of session</a>, so we are close to being able to close the book on our tracking of these restrictions for 2021. Based on data from the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-voting-bills-tracker-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brennan Center for Justice</a> and the <a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voting Rights Lab</a> as well as our own research, we now count 52 new voting restrictions that have been enacted this year in 21 different states. And 41 of the 52 were sponsored primarily or entirely by Republicans.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1250" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-mejia.VOTING-RESTRICTIONS-2.0809.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-mejia.VOTING-RESTRICTIONS-2.0809.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-mejia.VOTING-RESTRICTIONS-2.0809.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-mejia.VOTING-RESTRICTIONS-2.0809.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In total, state legislators proposed a whopping 581 voting-restriction bills this year — 89 percent of them sponsored by Republicans. Most (402) were rejected or failed to pass before a key deadline, but 42 of those passed at least one state-legislative chamber before dying, and another eight would have become law had they not been vetoed by their state’s (usually Democratic) governor.<a data-footnote-id="46" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-46" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One was vetoed by a Republican governor, Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, as &lt;a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/ducey-goes-on-veto-spree-demands-budget-passage/article_a92275d6-bfe5-11eb-9ca2-833e7aad09b7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;retribution&lt;/a&gt; for the legislature not sending him a budget on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>46</sup></a> And technically, 127 voting-restriction bills are still alive, including 20 that have passed at least one chamber. However, these bills are mostly either <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/23/michigan-house-republicans-pass-bills-enact-strict-voter-id-laws/5328162001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked by Democratic governors</a> or <a href="https://legiscan.com/OH/bill/HB294/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">languishing in committee</a> (putting them still quite far away from passage). So the number of voting restrictions enacted here in 2021 likely won’t rise very far, if at all, beyond 52.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even if nothing else passes, though, that is still a staggering number by historical standards. The Brennan Center for Justice has tracked the number of new voting restrictions enacted every year since 2011, and no year has even come close to 2021: The previous high was the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-law-changes-2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 voting restrictions</a> enacted in 2011,<a data-footnote-id="47" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-47" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of October of that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>47</sup></a> the year after Republicans took full control of several state governments in the 2010 election. In <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2012-voting-laws-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years</a>, the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number</a> of <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new</a> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictions</a> has <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically</a> been in the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single</a> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digits</a>. (For example, 2020 saw only <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2020-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven new voting restrictions</a> become law.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The sheer number of bills — both enacted and proposed — really emphasizes what a big priority tightening election laws has become for the GOP since the 2020 election. But it’s also important to remember that a single law can contain numerous far-reaching voting restrictions. And as such, <strong>Texas</strong>’s <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB1/2021/X2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Bill 1</a> is probably the most comprehensive voting-restriction law passed since <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/05/06/gov-ron-desantis-signs-florida-voting-bill-in-front-of-trump-fan-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida’s SB 90</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/30/texas-voting-restrictions-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SB 1 requires</a> absentee voters to provide their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number on both their absentee-ballot application and absentee-ballot envelope; gives partisan poll watchers “free movement” around polling places; requires the secretary of state to check the voting rolls for noncitizens; and creates more paperwork for people who help other people fill out their ballots. It also bans specific ways of encouraging voting that were used by heavily Democratic counties, such as Harris, in last year’s election — including automatically mailing absentee-ballot applications to voters, drive-through voting and 24-hour early voting. The law does, however, include some provisions supported by Democrats, such as allowing voters to fix, or “cure,” mistakes on their absentee ballots and requiring training for poll watchers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here’s a summary of the other 27 voting restrictions that have become law since <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-have-made-it-harder-to-vote-in-11-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our last update</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Arizona</strong> enacted no fewer than five voting restrictions this year. The biggest outrage has centered on <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1485/2021">SB 1485</a>, which effectively ends the permanence of the state’s permanent absentee voting list by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/arizona-legislature-passes-law-purge-infrequent-mail-voters-n1267025">removing voters</a> who don’t cast an absentee ballot in two straight election cycles and don’t respond to a mailed notice. In addition, though, the state now <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1003/2021">requires</a> absentee ballots with missing signatures to be <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/gov-doug-ducey-signs-mail-in-ballot-signature-bill-amid-protest-over-voting-rights">cured by Election Day</a> (instead of giving voters a five-day grace period) and makes it a <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/HB2905/2021">felony</a> for election officials to <a href="https://grandcanyontimes.com/stories/605396122-arizona-passes-hb-2905-to-crack-down-on-voter-fraud-by-placing-restrictions-on-mail-in-ballots">mail an absentee ballot</a> to someone who hasn’t requested it. The state also has two new laws that appear to target Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs: <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/HB2794/2021">one</a> that prohibits election officials from <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/06/01/ducey-signs-bill-to-prohibit-changes-to-election-deadlines/">unilaterally changing election deadlines</a>, and <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/SB1819/2021">another</a> that gives the state attorney general (who is a Republican) <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/30/1011154122/arizona-republicans-strip-some-election-power-from-democratic-secretary-of-state">sole authority over election litigation</a> — but only until January 2023 (when Hobbs’s term ends).</li><li><strong>Iowa</strong> had already passed <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/08/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-shortening-early-voting-closing-polls-earlier-election-day/6869317002/">one major package</a> of voting restrictions this year, but it enacted a second one in June. <a href="https://legiscan.com/IA/bill/SF568/2021">This law</a> requires voters who cast provisional ballots because they lack ID to return with their ID by the end of the day in order for their ballot to count. The law also makes it more difficult to set up an early-voting site and imposes several restrictions on “delivery agents,” or people who help voters with disabilities: They must fill out a special form, they cannot deliver more than two ballots and they must drop off the ballots in person at election offices, showing ID to do so.</li><li>A <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/HB285/2021">new law</a> in <strong>Alabama</strong> <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/05/curbside-voting-ban-becomes-alabama-law-with-gov-kay-iveys-signature.html">bans curbside voting</a>, whereby disabled voters and those at heightened risk from COVID-19 can vote from their car outside a polling place. Two less controversial measures have also been added to the books: <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/HB314/2021">one</a> that purges voters from the rolls if the U.S. Postal Service indicates that they have changed addresses and if the voter does not return a pre-addressed card updating or confirming their address, and <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/HB538/2021">another</a> that moves up the deadline to request an absentee ballot by mail by two days (the deadline to request one in person remains the same).</li><li><strong>Montana</strong> now <a href="https://legiscan.com/MT/bill/HB530/2021">bans</a> people from being paid to deliver other people’s absentee ballots, a practice sometimes derided as “ballot harvesting.” Native American groups and the American Civil Liberties Union are now <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2021/05/18/montana-election-laws-challenged-in-court/">suing to overturn the law</a>, as well as a previous law eliminating same-day voter registration.</li><li><strong>Texas</strong> also passed four lower-profile voting restrictions: <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB1113/2021">one</a> that allows the secretary of state to withhold funding from local election offices that don’t purge voters from the rolls as required by state law; <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/HB3920/2021">one</a> that spells out certain excuses that are <em>not</em> valid reasons for requesting an absentee ballot; <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/HB574/2021">one</a> that makes it a felony for election officials to knowingly count “invalid” votes; and <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB1111/2021">one</a> that bans registering to vote at a P.O. box.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>On Thursday, President Biden announced a new Labor Department rule <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/us/politics/biden-vaccine-plan-highlights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that would require</a> all employers with more than 100 employees to make sure workers get fully vaccinated or test negative for COVID-19 once a week. It’s the federal government’s most aggressive step yet toward a vaccine mandate, and it’s one that comes fraught with legal and political pushback. It’s not the first time the country has dabbled with stringent vaccine mandates, though. For decades, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states have required kids to get vaccinated</a> to go to school. That has its own complicated history, however, as Maggie Koerth wrote about before Biden made his announcement.</em></p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fall 2019, before anyone had ever heard of COVID-19, California legislators were trying to pass a bill aimed at increasing childhood vaccination. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-me-ln-essential-california-20190507-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five years previously</a>, someone at Disneyland had set off a measles outbreak that infected more than 100 people, mostly unvaccinated, in the state — as well as in six other states, Canada and Mexico. The incident galvanized legislators and led to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-measles-us-california-outbreak-vaccine-new-york-disneyland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of laws</a> aimed at curtailing the religious and philosophical exemptions that allowed parents to avoid getting their kids vaccinated before sending them to school. Take the exemptions away, the thinking went, and vaccine rates would rise. But the level of vitriol that enters politics when you try to mandate vaccines can be … intense.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The California Senate had to be evacuated because someone took — and this is more detail than you want — <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-02/vaccine-law-protester-blood-california-state-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a cup full of menstrual blood</a> and hurled it onto the Senate floor,” Alison Buttenheim, a professor of nursing and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, things are similarly tense. COVID-19 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/23/world/covid-delta-variant-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination requirements</a> are taking effect across the country. Universities are <a href="https://universitybusiness.com/state-by-state-look-at-colleges-requiring-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring students</a> to get vaccinated. Businesses are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/business/companies-vaccine-mandate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mandating vaccines</a> for employees and customers. <a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/covid-19-vaccine-mandate-for-virginia-state-employees-goes-into-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">States</a>, <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/honolulu-covid-19-vaccination-proof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cities</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-us-military-requirement-pentagon-3975940c732352f72e41f6e34a3a2669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the U.S. military</a> have made COVID-19 vaccination a must for <a href="https://katu.com/news/local/covid-19-vaccine-required-for-city-of-portland-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public employees</a>. But, as in California, the pushback has been fierce, with <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/570120-vaccine-mandate-opponents-protest-at-la-council-members-homes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-oak-lawn-woman-fake-vaccination-card-hawaii-20210901-ci3ndzqemzaajosv5v7nhfc5tu-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake vaccine cards</a> and <a href="https://www.nashp.org/state-lawmakers-submit-bills-to-ban-employer-vaccine-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outright bans on the mandates</a> in some states. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Simply enacting a law or regulation mandating vaccines isn’t enough. California ended up spending years cleaning up loopholes that parents used to get out of vaccinating their kids. The fact that the California legislature was still tinkering with the state’s vaccination laws in 2019 says a lot. To this day, the state medical board is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-24/vaccine-exemptions-medical-discipline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dealing with physicians</a> who were willing to write <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/2020/09/california-doctor-school-vaccination-exemptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thousands of bogus medical exemptions</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/Health/video/covid-19-vaccines-work-74654465</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Mandates work. As the laws changed, <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/07/california-laws-tied-higher-kindergarten-vaccine-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination rates among California kindergarteners did go up</a>. But ideological values, deeply personal fears and (increasingly) political polarization all mean that a vaccine mandate isn’t just a switch you flip on and walk away from. Instead, a mandate is a finicky machine that has to be maintained, lest it fall apart. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">School entrance mandates are probably the single most effective thing we’ve done to achieve high vaccination rates in the United States, said <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/jc988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Colgrove</a>, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University. “Can you achieve it through voluntary means? No. Not really,” he told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mandates have focused on kids both because they are particularly at risk of severe illness and because schools are such a perfect incubator for transmission. Pack a bunch of people with no naturally acquired immunity into one building five days a week, add a child’s complete lack of boundaries and you’ve got disease soup.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But the country has long waxed and waned on whether to require kids to get vaccinated. School vaccine requirements have <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been with us a long time</a> — nearly as long as public schooling itself. Smallpox vaccination — the only vaccine that existed early in the history of public education — was required for entry into Boston public schools in 1827. But for much of American history, mandates were inconsistently applied across geography and tended to come and go over time. For example, Washington and Wisconsin ended school vaccination requirements in 1919 and 1920, respectively, and during the 1920s, the Utah and North Dakota legislatures passed laws forbidding compulsory vaccination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But mandates became more of a mainstay in the late 20th century, when a series of school-based measles outbreaks swept the nation in the 1970s — and it quickly became clear that vaccines could help. In Texarkana, a city split by the Texas-Arkansas border, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Walter-Orenstein/publication/6665779_The_Role_of_Measles_Elimination_in_Development_of_a_National_Immunization_Program/links/59da4b1faca272e6096be6a5/The-Role-of-Measles-Elimination-in-Development-of-a-National-Immunization-Program.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Arkansas side had a vaccine mandate and fared far better than the Texas side</a>, which had no mandate. By 1980, every state had some kind of compulsory vaccination for school-age children. Annual cases of measles dropped from tens of thousands in the 1970s to fewer than 2,000 by 1983. During the 20th century, measles infected an average of more than 500,000 Americans each year. In 2005, after decades of school vaccine mandates and vaccination rates higher than 90 percent, it infected 66 people. Vaccines reduced the spread of disease, and making the vaccines mandatory all but eliminated it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5007135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence like this</a> that gives public health experts solid reason to think requiring a COVID-19 vaccine — whether in workplaces, for school attendance or to go to places like restaurants — would boost vaccination rates and reduce illness in a way that purely voluntary vaccination campaigns just can’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not as easy as snapping your fingers and having everything work out. To get them right, vaccine mandates require compromise, tinkering and a lot of legal and political follow-up. COVID-19 mandates will almost certainly demand the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hanging over everything is the tradeoff between getting more people vaccinated and shutting out those who aren’t vaccinated. Douglas Diekema, the director of education for the Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics at Seattle Children’s Hospital, noted that anytime a government institutes a school-based mandate, they’re balancing two public goods: preventing disease and getting kids educated. “I think you need a good reason … to take that benefit away from people who won’t get vaccinated,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">COVID-19 vaccination requirements are bound to run into similar priority struggles. We, as a society, want more people vaccinated — we also want people to be employed and be able to go to college. And unlike the diseases that childhood vaccines have strongly curtailed, COVID-19 is an active pandemic. The choice isn’t just about “prevention” versus “access to societal services.” You have to factor in the health and lives of other people too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not everyone will make the same choices about how to balance access with safety. States have <a href="https://www.immunize.org/laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly different requirements</a> about how many vaccinations are required to go to school, and whether they’re <em>really</em> required. Some vaccines are required for school entry in every state — measles, polio, diphtheria — because they have extremely high efficacy rates and are related to diseases that spread through normal daily contact with other kids in schools. But only six states — plus New York City — require flu vaccines, which have lower efficacy. Only three states require vaccination for human papilloma virus — a disease that’s spread by sexual contact, and which has been heavily politicized by groups that framed it as giving preteens and teenagers adult approval to go have sex.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s likely COVID-19 vaccine requirements will remain a patchwork as well, said several experts I spoke with. Politicization and breakthrough cases are likely to mean the COVID-19 vaccine has more in common with the ones for HPV and flu than it does with the one for measles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even once you decide on rules, you have to decide on how staunchly to enforce them. In schools, all states allow medical exemptions because some children have immune disorders or specific allergies to vaccine ingredients. Forty-four states allow parents to exempt their children from vaccines because of religious beliefs, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/28/nearly-all-states-allow-religious-exemptions-for-vaccinations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a product of heavy lobbying</a> efforts by Christian Scientists during the 1970s. Other exemptions for vaguer “philosophical beliefs” — which 18 states now offer — evolved over time as a response to legal concerns about states favoring religion. Colgrove referred to all these exemptions as a “safety valve” — a way of accommodating the very small percentage of people who will never accept vaccination, without creating political standoffs or forcing children out of school.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The challenge for COVID-19 vaccines, as for childhood vaccines, will be in how to offer exemptions without making exemptions too easy to get. Several of the five researchers I spoke to told me that over the past decade a few states have dealt with the problem of childhood vaccination by tightening restrictions and providing better access to vaccines — making it logistically easier to get immunized than to get out of it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, there’s the question of what to do when some flout the rules. “This is not stuff that’s fun for anybody to enforce,” said Buttenheim. “In California, with public schools at least, the schools have a huge disincentive to exclude kids, because they don’t get paid. So excluding a kid for vaccination status loses you money as a school.” Nationwide, it’s not uncommon for schools to give parents time to catch up on mandated vaccines without kicking kids out — and sometimes once parents are granted extra time, schools don’t have the staffing resources to follow up, said Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at the Baylor College of Medicine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Creating a vaccine mandate — and enforcing it — is almost certainly going to require governments and institutions to come up with ways of dealing with loopholes and fraud. After the Disneyland outbreak in California, the state eliminated all nonmedical exemptions, becoming <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-04-28/connecticut-is-6th-state-to-end-religious-vaccine-exemption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of six states in total</a>. But the change didn’t mean a straight line to higher vaccination rates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There were suddenly a whole lot more medical exemptions,” Buttenheim told me. Medical exemptions <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/5/e20181051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased by 250 percent</a> over the next two years — with many of the exemptions being signed by a handful of doctors. Between 2016 and 2018, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-22/california-homeschool-strict-vaccination-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of unvaccinated kindergarteners being homeschooled quadrupled</a>. Making the mandate actually work has turned out to be a game of whack-a-mole, with legislators passing laws that specify which medical issues count as vaccine exemptions and establishing a surveillance system that approves exemptions and flags doctors for investigation if they’re handing out a lot of get-out-of-vaccine-free cards. While Buttenheim’s research suggests this has reduced and will continue to reduce the overall share of unvaccinated children in California, it takes a lot of work and resources to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7446529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase vaccination rates by 1 percent, or even less</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The push for COVID-19 mandates could also have repercussions for other childhood vaccinations. Already, the Tennessee legislature has responded to COVID-19 vaccination by pressuring the state department of health to <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/07/13/tennessee-halts-all-vaccine-outreach-minors-not-just-covid-19/7928701002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop promoting <em>any </em>vaccine</a> to minors — including school-based vaccine clinics, something that research has shown is crucial for getting vaccines to kids whose parents might be comfortable with vaccines but who have budgets and work schedules or a lack of medical access that pushes vaccination down the family priority list. That’s on top of social disruption due to the pandemic itself, which has already <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7023a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced childhood vaccine uptake nationwide</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bottom line, according to the researchers I spoke with, is that vaccine mandates are a really powerful public health tool. They’re effective, the childhood vaccine mandates have been widely supported, and they’ve been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court. But that doesn’t mean they’re easy to implement.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When she was hired as a professor by Harvard University in 2013, Lorgia García Peña was the only Black Latina on a tenure track in the university’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. But in 2019, she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/why-lorgia-garcia-pena-was-denied-tenure-at-harvard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was denied tenure</a> even though her department chair and two deans had told her that she should apply for early tenure. Her tenure committee also unanimously recommended she be promoted, and another committee above that endorsed its recommendation. About two years later, famed professor and public intellectual Cornel West announced that he, too, was leaving Harvard after the university <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/us/cornel-west-leaving-harvard-union.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to grant him tenure</a>. And of course, this spring we learned that Pulitzer Prize-winning, MacArthur Fellowship recipient Nikole Hannah-Jones <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/business/media/nikole-hannah-jones-unc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was denied tenure</a> by the board of trustees at the University of North Carolina — after the university’s journalism school had recruited her to become its Knight Chair in Race and Investigative Journalism. That decision was later reversed, but by that point, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/13/1015260330/nikole-hannah-jones-chose-howard-over-unc-hbcus-hope-its-the-start-of-a-new-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was too late</a> to convince her to stay.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These stories made headlines and sparked outrage, <a href="https://hussmanfaculty.medium.com/stunned-unc-hussman-schfaculty-statement-on-nikole-hannah-jones-6333c5f5d072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially among academics</a>, in part because they were some of the biggest “no-brainer” tenure cases — those three scholars are among the most famous and well-regarded in their respective fields. Denying them tenure is functionally equivalent to having MVP-caliber athletes on your roster but sending them to play for another team.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the other reason these cases sparked outrage is that they shined a light on a larger problem that lurks beneath the surface of academia. It’s a problem that academia — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-many-americans-dont-see-the-racial-wealth-gap/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the rest of American society</a> — doesn’t like to acknowledge: <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-13977-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academia has a problem with race</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is one of higher education’s most insidious secrets. Academia is a place where, to use the language of sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, there is <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442276239/Racism-without-Racists-Color-Blind-Racism-and-the-Persistence-of-Racial-Inequality-in-America-Fifth-Edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racism without racists</a>. By that, we mean that although most people prefer to think that they or their colleagues are <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/blindspot-mahzarin-r-banaji/1102334630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good people who would not intentionally discriminate</a>, there is plenty of evidence suggesting that racism plays an important role in the structure and function of academic institutions. It affects <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090952403000044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what gets researched and taught in courses</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/White-Logic-Methods-Racism-Methodology/dp/0742542815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">methods that are used</a> to conduct that research and the topic we will primarily focus on today: The people who are included — or excluded — from academic institutions <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-13977-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the first place</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/descendants-historic-black-leaders-share-legacies-78361733</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start by first looking at the demographics of academic institutions. The National Center for Education Statistics keeps detailed records of this in the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System</a> (IPEDS). That database provides demographic breakdowns of students and faculty who work at colleges and universities in the U.S., which can be compared to the demographic makeup of the overall U.S. population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the things you can see when looking at that database is that Black, Hispanic, American Indian and mutiracial faculty members are underrepresented in the faculty ranks, compared to not only their share of the U.S. population but also to the student bodies of colleges and universities. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="3640" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matias-lewis-hope-FACULTY-DIVERSITY-0907-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matias-lewis-hope-FACULTY-DIVERSITY-0907-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matias-lewis-hope-FACULTY-DIVERSITY-0907-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matias-lewis-hope-FACULTY-DIVERSITY-0907-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But those statistics, though troubling in their own right, actually mask a bigger issue, given how the American academic system is set up. The word “faculty” is an umbrella term that obscures some important hierarchical divisions, including the difference between tenure-track and tenured professors versus untenured professors. It’s a pretty important distinction, too. According to the <a href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Association of University Professors</a>, only 21 percent of faculty are tenured. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tenure is, admittedly, an unusual concept in most professions, but is an important feature of academia: Tenured positions are indefinite appointments that are designed to safeguard academic freedom. To use the language of the AAUP:</p>



<blockquote><p>“When faculty members can lose their positions because of their speech, publications or research findings, they cannot properly fulfill their core responsibilities to advance and transmit knowledge. Tenure provides the conditions for faculty to pursue research and innovation and draw evidence-based conclusions free from corporate or political pressure.”</p></blockquote>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, it protects faculty, like Hannah-Jones, when they pursue questions and projects (like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1619 project</a>) that political actors might find objectionable. The ability to pursue knowledge freely has been one of the hallmarks of our higher education system. It’s worth asking, then, who does — and does not — get the opportunity to hold those coveted tenure-track and tenured positions at America’s universities. The answer to that question is even more sobering than the statistics we just shared. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.provost.umich.edu/reports/Diversity%20Equity%20Inclusion%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over the past decade</a>, colleges and universities have been discussing the need to diversify their faculty: In particular, they’ve tried to increase the share of Black, Hispanic and Indigenous faculty members, all of whom have <a href="https://crge.umd.edu/underrepresented-minority-faculty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically been underrepresented</a> in the faculty ranks. Faculty diversity initiatives can be seen at universities around the country, including <a href="https://source.wustl.edu/2020/09/call-for-proposals-opens-for-race-and-ethnicity-cluster-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington University in St. Louis</a>, the <a href="https://www.as.virginia.edu/next-steps-arts-sciences-race-justice-equity-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Virginia</a> and the <a href="https://provostpostdoc.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Chicago</a>. But despite all of the talk about increasing diversity, it does not seem like universities have made much progress — at least when it comes to the diversity of the tenure-track and tenured faculty. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to the IPEDS database, underrepresented minority faculty (URM) comprised roughly 11 percent of tenure-track or tenured faculty in 2013 and increased to just 12 percent of tenure-track or tenured faculty in 2019. The numbers weren’t much better for universities looking to increase the gender diversity of their tenure-track or tenured faculty either. Over that same period of time, the share of tenure-track or tenured faculty who were women increased from roughly 41 percent to 43 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Why have colleges and universities struggled to diversify the upper ranks of their faculty even though they’ve publicly talked about increasing faculty diversity and in some cases even <a href="https://provost.wustl.edu/programs-initiatives/faculty-diversity/race-and-ethnicity-cluster-hire-initiative/#:~:text=Through%20the%20Race%20and%20Ethnicity,University%27s%20distinction%20in%20this%20area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed funding</a> toward faculty diversity initiatives? One of the biggest reasons is that many universities still struggle to <em>retain</em> the women and people of color they hire as part of those initiatives.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, at Cornell University, where two of us work, a recent <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/07/task-force-looks-move-needle-faculty-diversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">task-force report</a> on the university’s faculty diversity efforts noted that the university had hired 37 professors from URM backgrounds and 97 female professors from 2011 to 2018. But despite those hiring gains, the university also failed to retain 19 URM and 64 female professors during that same time period. These retention struggles help explain why Cornell, despite being the “<a href="https://brand.cornell.edu/messaging/founding-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any person, any study</a>” university, still has so few <a href="https://cornellsun.com/2021/07/02/i-dont-want-to-be-the-only-one-cornells-8-black-women-full-professors-face-disproportionate-burdens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black women who are tenured faculty</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are, of course, many reasons that faculty leave institutions. Sometimes they get better offers at other institutions. Other times they move for family or other personal reasons. But there is a third set of reasons that tie back to the examples we opened with: While many academic institutions <em>claim</em> to want to have a diverse faculty, many of them engage in practices that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221546.2021.1914494?forwardService=showFullText&amp;tokenAccess=EISWNKJAFQXJ6CZAZIH4&amp;tokenDomain=eprints&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;target=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;journalCode=uhej20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately push those faculty out</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, consider who gets to make the rules. Tenured scholars who, as we’ve noted, are mostly white and male, largely make the rules that determine who else can join the tenured ranks. This involves what sociologists call “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095325?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boundary work</a>,” or the practice of a group setting rules to determine who is good enough to join. And as such, many of the rules established around tenure over the years work really well for white scholars, but <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691617709590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t adequately capture</a> the contributions of scholars of color. For instance, getting tenure often requires some combination of demonstrating excellence in research (measured by publication metrics and funding) and teaching (measured by teaching evaluations). It turns out though, that the topics that scholars of color often research are <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw7238" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to receive research funding</a> and, at least in some fields, are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691620927709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to be included</a> in the very journals that are valued for promotion. Scholars of color are also <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/68/2/254/4958972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely than white scholars to be cited when their work is published</a>. And on the teaching front, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/exploring-bias-in-student-evaluations-gender-race-and-ethnicity/91670F6003965C5646680D314CF02FA4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women and people of color are often evaluated more poorly</a> than white men, even when they are teaching identical content.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What this all adds up to is that when colleges and universities invite scholars of color to join their ranks and increase the diversity of their faculty, they are inviting them to play a game that’s <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469627717/writtenunwritten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up for them to lose</a>. Faculty of color come to an institution looking to teach bright students and conduct innovative research. Instead, they often face hostile work environments where their intellectual contributions are undervalued. Even among the faculty of color who do earn tenure, negative experiences repeatedly <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221546.2021.1914494?forwardService=showFullText&amp;tokenAccess=EISWNKJAFQXJ6CZAZIH4&amp;tokenDomain=eprints&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;target=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;journalCode=uhej20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt them to search for jobs</a> at different institutions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This leads to an academic shuffle where universities convince the few tenured professors of color to change institutions instead of supporting more professors of color so that they get tenure. And some professors of color — both tenured and untenured — are leaving academia altogether. Inside Higher Ed reported earlier this year that <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/05/03/multiple-black-professors-have-resigned-recent-years-over-racism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of professors of color</a>, especially women of color, have left their universities, citing racism as a primary motivator. We saw this play out at UNC with Hannah-Jones’s tenure case, too, where at least five women of color who were full professors or administrators <a href="https://www.wunc.org/education/2021-06-21/time-faculty-color-explain-made-ready-leave-unc-chapel-hill-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left the university</a>.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, where do we go from here? Universities say they want to increase diversity among their faculty ranks, but as we’ve outlined in this article, they have very little to show for those intentions. Fortunately, many scholars of color have written extensively about <a href="https://www.diverseeducation.com/opinion/article/15091919/ten-ways-to-retain-faculty-of-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways to recruit and retain people of color</a> in academia. For instance, we know that higher education must be clear and transparent about the qualifications for tenure and apply the rules fairly. We also know that it’s not enough for universities to hire just a handful of faculty of color: They must hire enough professors to create a welcoming environment for scholars of color, especially in geographic regions that may not provide social support outside of university life. And perhaps most importantly, colleges and universities must value faculty of color beyond their contributions to achieving the diversity goals of the university. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Higher education cannot look to faculty of color to do the heavy lifting of racial equity work <em>and </em>do their jobs. Otherwise, as we see in the trends above, nothing will change.</p>
