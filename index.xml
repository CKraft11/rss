<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Jerrold Nadler won his Manhattan primary against fellow Rep. Carolyn Maloney in a walk on Tuesday. And in downtown Manhattan, the former federal prosecutor and lead counsel in Trump’s first impeachment inquiry, Dan Goldman, pulled out a victory in a crowded field. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Elsewhere in the state, Democrats overperformed in two special elections, including a win in New York’s 19th District, which is 4 percentage points more Republican than the nation, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew discusses what these results mean for the midterms this fall and where other indicators of the political environment are pointing.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In your <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typical midterm election</a> with an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular Democratic president</a>, you’d expect Republicans to be flying high. But the evidence is mounting that the national political environment right now actually leans toward <em>Democrats</em>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, Democrat Pat Ryan defeated Republican Marc Molinaro in a special election for New York’s swingy 19th Congressional District by 2 percentage points, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=88696554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51 percent to 49 percent</a>.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> At the same time, Republican Joe Sempolinski defeated Democrat Max Della Pia by a closer-than-expected margin of 7 points in the special election for New York’s solid-red 23rd District. On their own, these elections could be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-special-election-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismissed as flukes</a>, chalked up to local factors or particularly strong or weak candidates. But given how these two elections are part of a larger pattern of good results for Democrats over the last two months, they suddenly look a lot more like signal than noise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We at FiveThirtyEight often track the results of special elections (i.e., elections that occur at unusual times because an office unexpectedly becomes vacant) because of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints they provide to the national mood</a>. When a party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently does well in special elections</a> — defined not by winning or losing, but by outperforming a state or district’s baseline partisanship — it’s often a sign that the national political environment favors that party, and is therefore a <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/1/9/1698453/-Special-elections-are-correlated-with-House-election-results-and-that-s-good-news-for-Democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good omen for that party</a> in the upcoming regular general election.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/key-issues-abortion-rights-affect-primaries-ahead-midterms-88747544</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Up until mid-June, special elections for the U.S. House during the Biden presidency were pointing to a national political environment that was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-can-special-elections-so-far-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neutral or a little bit Republican-leaning</a>. On average, Republicans did 2 points better in those elections than you’d expect based on the districts’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan leans</a>.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> That all changed, though, starting in late June — immediately after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-overturns-roe-wade-landmark-case-abortion/story?id=85160781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturning the constitutional right to abortion</a>. There have been four first-past-the-post special House elections since that decision, and Democrats have outperformed their expected margins in those elections by an average of 9 points.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">(There is one data point missing from this analysis, however: the <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2022/02/08/alaska-ranked-choice-voting-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice</a> special election in Alaska’s at-large district. Currently, Republicans have <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22SSPG/ElectionSummaryReportRPTS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 percentage points</a> more first-place votes than Democrats in that race, despite Alaska’s R+15 partisan lean. But it’s not clear how meaningful that is, given the <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/08/11/why-republicans-in-alaskas-first-ranked-choice-election-reserve-their-venom-for-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unusual dynamics</a> at play in a ranked-choice election. In fact, when the ranked-choice votes are tabulated on Aug. 31, it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1562305696200380418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite possible</a> that the Democratic candidate will receive more votes than the last Republican standing — which would be an even <em>bigger</em> upset than Ryan’s win. We’ll just have to wait and see.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The pattern of Democratic overperformance started with the June 28 special election in Nebraska’s 1st District. No one expected this district with an R+17 partisan lean to be competitive, but it was a nailbiter: Republicans won by <a href="https://electionresults.nebraska.gov/resultsSW.aspx?text=Race&amp;type=CG&amp;map=DIST" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 5 points</a>. Then, on Aug. 9, Democrats came even closer (<a href="https://electionresults.sos.state.mn.us/20220809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within 4 points</a>) in a similarly red district, Minnesota’s 1st (partisan lean R+15). This was still just two data points, though. But then, of course, came Tuesday’s special elections in New York. In the 19th District, Democrats’ winning margin was 6 points better than the district’s R+4 partisan lean, and in the 23rd District, it was 9 points better. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bottom line is these two data points put to rest any notion that the Nebraska and Minnesota results were a fluke; special-election results are clearly indicating that the political winds are now at Democrats’ backs. And it’s not just special-election results. Democrats and their allies have also done well in other, non-special elections since Dobbs. The results of Washington’s top-two primaries (which, unusually, pit Democrats and Republicans against each other and have historically done a good job predicting the November elections) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/16/democrats-midterms-hopes-washington-00052049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were not consistent with past “red wave” midterm elections</a>. And a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-abortion-vote-in-kansas-looks-like-its-going-to-be-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas ballot measure</a> that would have clarified that the state constitution does <em>not</em> protect abortion rights <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article264681054.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed by a large, 18-point margin</a> despite the state’s conservative leanings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, one of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best indicators</a> we have of the national environment in a midterm year has also gotten better for Democrats since Dobbs — although it is currently showing more of a neutral political environment than a Democratic-leaning one. On the day of the Dobbs decision, Republicans led polls of the generic congressional ballot, or polls that ask Americans which party they plan to support for Congress, by 2.3 points, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s average</a>. But since then, Democrats have gained 2.7 points, and on Wednesday,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 11:45 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> they hold a small lead in these polls.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="920" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/generic-ballot-2-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/generic-ballot-2-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/generic-ballot-2-3.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/generic-ballot-2-3.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This is unusual, given that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-midterm-chances-dont-hinge-on-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls usually get <em>worse</em></a>, not better, for the president’s party as a midterm election draws closer. That could be a sign that 2022 could be the rare midterm that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bucks the usual trend</a> of the president’s party getting a “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/11/03/131046118/obama-humbled-by-election-shellacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shellacking</a>.” And if so, Democrats may have the Supreme Court to thank. Correlation isn’t causation, but given the precise timing (Republicans overperformed in special elections on June 7 and June 14, then Democrats started their hot streak on June 28), it seems quite likely that the Dobbs decision is responsible for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shift in the political environment</a>. In other words, it could be akin to other major news events that turned midterm elections on their heads: former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998, and the Sept. 11 attacks and subsequent war on terror in 2002. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also worth noting there has been other good news for Democrats in recent weeks: They <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/16/biden-inflation-reduction-act-signing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, a major climate, health-care and tax bill. Gas prices have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/energy/gas-prices-inflation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly declined</a>, potentially weakening the potency of Republican attacks on inflation. And President Biden’s approval rating has slowly been <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticking back up</a>. All these things could have contributed to Democrats’ special-election success too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But none of this is a guarantee of Democratic success in the midterms. As quickly as those developments broke, others — perhaps better for Republicans — can replace them. The polls could still move away from Democrats, in keeping with historical precedent. Of course, events thus far have suggested we aren’t in a typical midterm situation; for instance, maybe the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch from registered-voter polls to likely-voter polls</a> won’t benefit Republicans as much as expected because <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/nbc-news-poll-57-voters-say-investigations-trump-continue-rcna43989" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are so fired up</a>. But there are still two and a half months until Election Day. And while it’s hard to deny that Democrats have the momentum right now, it’s an open question of whether they can sustain it.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What happens when redistricting produces big changes in the third- and fourth-most populous states in the country? You get a bunch of fascinating primaries. Florida and New York have a huge number on tap today, along with a couple primary runoffs of interest in Oklahoma. My colleague Nathaniel Rakich covered <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-is-holding-another-primary-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Empire State’s multitude of high-profile races yesterday</a>, so now we’ll run through the 11 primaries to watch in Florida and two runoffs in Oklahoma.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<h2><strong>Florida</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 20th, 23rd and 27th congressional districts; governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>7 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the top of the ballot, Florida Democrats must pick their nominee in the race for <strong>governor</strong> against Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, and there are two key contenders in that race: Rep. Charlie Crist, a <a href="https://www.nga.org/governor/charlie-crist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former <em>Republican </em>governor</a> and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2014&amp;fips=12&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee</a>, and Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried, whose <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/11/18/this-is-how-nikki-fried-won-the-only-statewide-office-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow 2018 win</a> marks the only statewide victory by a Florida Democrat since 2012.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most polls since June have put Crist ahead, including a poll released Monday from <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/549748-final-poll-charlie-crist-headed-to-victory-in-florida-democratic-primary-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Pete Polls/FloridaPolitics.com</a> that found him leading 59 percent to 30 percent, which echoed findings <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/544017-poll-charlie-crist-maintains-dominating-lead-in-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from earlier this month</a>. And <a href="https://charliecrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/August-2022-Florida-Primary-Change-Research.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent polls</a> conducted <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/548125-charlie-crist-releases-another-internal-showing-dominating-primary-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on behalf</a> of Crist’s campaign have shown him ahead as well, as did Fried’s latest poll, a <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinCate/status/1557353944153833473?s=20&amp;t=DBJ-ay5-9XKEdENFpJc6Ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Polling survey</a> conducted two weeks ago that found Crist ahead 42 percent to 35 percent. In something of an outlier, however, another recent poll from the University of North Florida <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/587232872/UNF-PORL-August-Survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found Fried narrowly ahead</a>, 47 percent to 43 percent, so she can’t be written off.</p>

Fried has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/charlie-crist-nikki-fried-blast-airwaves-rcna42904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also attacked Crist</a> for <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article2290614.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his work as a state legislator</a> in the 1990s to pass mandatory minimums for prison time, an issue that has <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/141027_iachr_racial_disparities_aclu_submission_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately affected communities of color</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Crist has shot back, however, <a href="https://youtu.be/E6gpRuYA5vo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with ads highlighting</a> his 2010 veto of Republican-backed legislation to restrict abortion rights and his high ratings from pro-abortion rights organizations. He’s also <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/99fe0fce-3c92-460c-be55-efa9080c1031/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit Fried for her past support</a> of some GOP politicians and <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/547942-nikki-fried-again-answers-for-matt-gaetz-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for her association</a> with Republican Rep.

<p data-paragraph="main">As for Florida’s high-profile congressional primaries, most are taking place in seats that are relatively safe for one party, as 25 of the state’s 28 districts are rated “solid Democratic” or “solid Republican,” according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our election forecast</a>. In fact, there’s only one must-watch House primary that involves the underdog party, and that’s in the <strong>27th District</strong>, which on paper <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is the most competitive seat in Florida</a> with a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+1.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;

Moskowitz has the edge in the money race, having raised $1.3 million to Sorensen’s $606,000 while also attracting $642,000 in outside spending support, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=FL23&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to OpenSecrets</a>, with about two-thirds coming from <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/06/21/crypto-linked-super-pacs-boost-spending-on-primary-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency-funded groups</a> Protect Our Future and Web3 Forward.

<p data-paragraph="main">The other notable South Florida primary is in the deep blue <strong>20th District</strong>, a plurality-Black seat represented by Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick. She won the seat in a January special election, but the real race was in the November Democratic primary, where <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-chefilus-mccormick-holness-primary-rematch-20220815-jn4mivcxojfghj2xpp3dvxf734-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she defeated</a> former Broward County Commissioner Dale Holness by just five votes in a crowded race. Now Holness is back for a rematch, and <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-chefilus-mccormick-holness-primary-rematch-20220815-jn4mivcxojfghj2xpp3dvxf734-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s cast Cherfilus-McCormick as corrupt</a> because of the timing of contracts awarded to her company and the sizable self-funding of her own campaign. But Holness <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20159/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only had $79,000</a> in his account for the final stretch. By contrast, Cherfilus-McCormick <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8FL20032/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had $1.4 million</a>, and she has the backing of the other leading opponents in last year’s special election primary. A <a href="https://www.termlimits.com/library/USTL%20FL20%20Toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June poll</a> from RMG Research/U.S. Term Limits found her leading Holness 45 percent to 21 percent in the primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Shifting our sights to central Florida, the GOP primary will probably pick the next representative from the Tampa Bay-area <strong>13th District</strong>, a seat that Crist left behind to run for governor and that shifted from R+1 to R+12 in redistricting. For much of the campaign, Air Force veteran Anna Paulina Luna <a href="https://sunshinesummit.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Florida-Battleground-CD-Brushfires_7-13-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked like the front-runner</a>, as she’d given Crist <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/elections/2020/11/03/florida-13th-district-crist-takes-early-lead-over-luna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a close race in 2020</a> and <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/09/14/trump-endorses-anna-paulina-luna-in-gop-primary-for-pinellas-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has former President Donald Trump’s endorsement</a>.

Hayslett <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL13287/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $1.6 million, which he’s <a href="https://youtu.be/5sMdmGi1OUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used on ads</a> aligning himself with Trump and DeSantis on immigration, claiming he’ll “seal the border” while arguing Luna supports former President Barack Obama’s pathway to citizenship approach for undocumented immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/fhoDJHVOJI0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hayslett has also highlighted his background</a> as a prosecutor, especially his work against drug cartels, and a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/indexpend.php?cmte=C00804617&amp;cycle=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super PAC backing his candidacy</a> has spent $2.4 million hitting on <a href="https://youtu.be/3jxiaqZ_O7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same messages</a>.

The winner will face former Defense Department official Eric Lynn, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nearby, the newly-drawn <strong>15th District</strong> east of Tampa is an R+7 seat that could be competitive in November, but its crowded GOP primary will probably pick the district’s next representative. It’s not clear whom Republicans will back, but former Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, state Sen. Kelli Stargel and state Rep. Jackie Toledo have emerged as the front-runners. We have a handful of independent polls of this primary, but they differ quite a bit. An early July poll <a href="https://sunshinesummit.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Florida-Battleground-CD-Brushfires_7-13-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by the Tyson Group</a> found Stargel at 13 percent, followed by Lee and Toledo at 10 percent, and was used to <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2022/07/14/new-gop-poll-shows-whos-ahead-in-crowded-primaries-00045758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set a qualification threshold</a> for debates. But more recent surveys <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/543393-poll-laurel-lee-opens-up-massive-lead-in-cd-15-gop-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early August</a> and <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/549339-poll-majority-of-gop-voters-who-already-cast-cd-15-ballots-support-laurel-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just before the primary</a> by St. Pete Polls/FloridaPolitics.com found Lee in the mid-to-high 40s, well ahead of Stargel at around 20 percent and Toledo, who dropped into the single-digits in the later poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lee’s lead could be down to her financial edge, especially her aid from outside groups. She <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL15241/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has brought in</a> $663,000 on her own, but the Conservative Action Fund and Americans for Prosperity <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=FL15&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have spent</a> $1.4 million on her behalf. Stargel <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL15233/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t raised as much</a> — $348,000 ($100,000 from her own pocket) — but Conservative Warriors PAC has spent $946,000 supporting her or opposing Lee or Toledo. This has <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2022/08/11/floridas-smooth-2020-election-gets-bashed-in-gop-primary-00051038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included ads</a> portraying Lee <a href="https://youtu.be/Eujxft-_AMc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as weak on election security</a> because she didn’t support an audit of Florida’s 2020 results (note that Trump <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=12&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won Florida by 3 points</a>). But Lee and her allies <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2022/08/01/how-republican-candidates-are-using-desantis-00048860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tried to portray her as close to DeSantis</a>, who is popular with Republicans, by <a href="https://vimeo.com/735265695" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running ads</a> arguing that she was DeSantis’s pick “to safeguard our elections,” a clear play to GOP primary voters’ Trump-inspired concerns about election security. Toledo is also in the mix, having raised $559,000, but she hasn’t gotten much outside backing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another former swing seat that redistricting shifted heavily to the right is the <strong>7th District</strong> north of Orlando, which went from D+5 to R+14.

<p data-paragraph="main">West of Orlando, the GOP primary for the R+19 <strong>11th District</strong> features a contest between Rep. Daniel Webster and far-right activist Laura Loomer, who has called herself a “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/19/21375159/laura-loomer-congress-republican-florida-trump-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proud Islamophobe</a>” and has been banned by multiple social-media platforms. As an incumbent, Webster is favored, but we can’t rule out Loomer surprising him. After all, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/11/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she’s outraised</a> Webster $763,000 to $595,000, and voters aren’t necessarily that familiar with him as Webster currently represents only about one-third of this district following redistricting. Still, Webster did enter the home stretch of the campaign with more than three times as much money as Loomer, $378,000 to $112,000. Loomer has tried to portray Webster, who is 73, as too old to be in Congress, but that’s a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/laura-loomer-attacks-opponent-for-his-age-in-famously-elderly-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questionable line of attack</a> in a district that includes <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/opinions/mark-meadows-the-villages-florida-nostalgia-trump-hemmer/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Villages</a>, a huge and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very Republican-leaning</a> retirement community.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s also a crowded Democratic primary in the Orlando-based <strong>10th District</strong>, which is open following Rep.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> With the seat’s D+29 partisan lean, the primary will decide the seat’s next occupant, and 10 Democrats have piled into the contest. The leading candidates appear to be gun safety activist Maxwell Alejandro Frost and state Sen. Randolph Bracy, but the field also includes pastor Terence Gray and two controversial blasts from the past in former Reps. Alan Grayson and Corrine Brown. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In Florida’s panhandle, Gaetz faces meaningful opposition in the deep-red <strong>1st District</strong>’s GOP primary in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/27/sex-trafficking-allegations-matt-gaetz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the wake of an ongoing federal investigation</a> into whether he engaged in sexual activities with a 17-year old girl and paid for women to cross state lines to have sex. Former FedEx executive Mark Lombardo has tried to use the scandal against Gaetz, running ads tying Gaetz’s investigation <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/31/facebook-posts/yes-matt-gaetz-was-lone-no-vote-human-trafficking-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to his lone dissenting vote</a> on a 2017 human trafficking bill signed into law by Trump. Lombardo has also <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matt-gaetz-fbi-informant-campaign-ad_n_62fdad64e4b0a85a819884df" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made unsubstantiated claims</a> that <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matt-gaetz-fbi-informant-campaign-ad_n_62fdad64e4b0a85a819884df" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaetz was an informant against Trump</a> who tipped off the FBI to classified documents that it recently seized at Mar-a-Lago.

Moreover, Gaetz <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintains a huge financial edge</a> over Lombardo: The incumbent had spent $6.5 million as of Aug. 3 to Lombardo’s $515,000, and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL01282/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of Lombardo’s money is self-funded</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, redistricting in northern Florida did away with the plurality-Black district running from Tallahassee to Jacksonville, and the new R+15 <strong>4th</strong> <strong>District</strong> will almost certainly elect a Republican in the fall. The GOP primary has developed into a two-man race between state Senate President Pro Tempore Aaron Bean and Navy veteran Erick Aguilar. Bean looks favored, though, based on the little polling we’ve seen. An early August survey from <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/544424-poll-aaron-bean-in-dominating-position-ahead-of-cd-4-gop-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Pete Polls/FloridaPolitics.com</a> found Bean well ahead with 59 percent to Aguilar’s 16 percent. Bean also enjoys endorsements from heavy hitters such as Rubio. And while DeSantis has not endorsed here, <a href="https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2022/07/14/florida-republican-aguilar-trump-00045643" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s been an ally of Bean</a>, too. Still, Aguilar <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has outraised</a> Bean, $1.3 million to $511,000, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0FL04140/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks in part to</a> $450,000 in self-funding, so he can’t be written off. However, Bean <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=FL04" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has received</a> $1.3 million in outside support to offset Aguilar’s edge while Aguilar has earned no outside backing.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 2nd Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the aftermath of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/21-republican-primaries-and-a-special-election-to-watch-on-june-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its June 28 primary</a>, the Sooner State has two notable GOP runoffs. Republican Rep. Markwayne Mullin and former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon will meet in a runoff in the special election for <strong>Senate</strong> to succeed Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe, <a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/oklahoma-sen-jim-inhofe-to-announce-resignation-report-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who announced</a> earlier this year that he would resign at the end of the current Congress. Mullin looks like the favorite. He handily led in the <a href="https://results.okelections.us/OKER/?elecDate=20220628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first round of voting</a> with about 44 percent of the vote, while Shannon had around 18 percent in the 13-candidate primary field. Moreover, Trump <a href="https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-donald-trump-endorses-markwayne-mullin/40573070" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has since endorsed Mullin</a>, and polls and money give Mullin an edge, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most polls have Mullin sitting right near the 50 percent mark, but the extent of Mullin’s lead has varied. A <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/630018f943e12207204b0ef4/poll:-race-for-gop-senate-nomination-tightens-in-oklahoma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll released on</a> Friday by SoonerPoll/News 9/News On 6 gave Mullin a 10-point edge, 49 percent to 39 percent, which was closer than Mullin’s 49 percent to 31 percent advantage in a poll conducted a couple of days earlier by <a href="https://www.amberintegrated.com/news/amber-integrated-releases-survey-of-likely-gop-run-off-election-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amber Integrated</a>. But <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00498345/1623196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mullin has</a> also <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00808360/1623359/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily outspent Shannon</a> since the primary, $634,000 to $92,000 as of Aug. 3. Shannon has struggled to outflank Mullin on the right, as their lone debate showed they <a href="https://www.newson6.com/story/62e9ac551e8392072d656c4d/mullin-shannon-talk-issues-in-prerunoff-senatorial-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely agree on most issues</a>, including support for abortion bans and Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was rigged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, a huge list of candidates jumped into the GOP primary to succeed Mullin in the dark-red <strong>2nd District</strong> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/oklahoma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in eastern Oklahoma</a>, and the outcome was much closer as state Rep. Avery Frix and former state Sen. Josh Brecheen <a href="https://results.okelections.us/OKER/?elecDate=20220628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advanced to a runoff with only</a> 15 and 14 percent of the vote, respectively. It looks like the runoff is going to be extremely competitive, too, as two surveys, one released in <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/62e9a49d4213e7071f5d09bf/poll:-oklahomas-cd2-gop-race-still-neckandneck-between-brecheen-frix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early August</a> and one <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/63001d8a963ad107263bc2c9/congressional-race-between-frix-brecheen-a-nailbiter-poll-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just before the primary</a> by SoonerPoll/News 9/News On 6, found the two running close together. Frix led by 6 points in the most recent poll, but 42 percent of primary voters were still undecided, which could make for an unpredictable outcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both candidates <a href="https://www.newson6.com/story/62f193ca856a4607267a8a61/district-2-race-heats-up-over-dark-money-funded-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have played up</a> their pro-Trump positions, yet <a href="https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/super-pacs-are-spending-big-on-gop-candidates-in-oklahomas-open-u-s-house-and-senate-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending by outside groups</a> questioning those conservative bona fides has turned this into an expensive contest. The pro-Brecheen School Freedom Fund (<a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/about/schoolfreedomfund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed by the Club for Growth</a>) has spent $1.8 million <a href="https://twitter.com/reesejgorman/status/1552745059312979969" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on mail pieces</a> and TV ads that have claimed Frix supported tax hikes as a state legislator. But the pro-Frix Fund for a Working Congress has countered with $1.3 million in ads, which have claimed that Brecheen wants to do away with the Electoral College or that if Brecheen “had his way Hillary Clinton would be President.” This outside influx in spending has <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/OK/02/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far outpaced candidate spending</a> in what looks to be anyone’s race.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What happens when a former president who is facing all kinds of legal problems is still the de facto party leader and considering another run for the White House? In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew dives into four major investigations into former President Donald Trump’s actions, the legal consequences he could be facing and how Americans are reacting to these evolving cases.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The team also analyzes <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/16/how-often-and-why-do-americans-change-their-minds?utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SM-2022-08-US-B2C-Politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new poll from YouGov</a> that breaks down how 78 percent of Americans say they have changed their mind on at least one political issue over their lifetimes. Finally, senior elections analyst Nathaniel Rakich gives a quick overview of the New York congressional and Florida primaries we’re tracking this Tuesday.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In late April, New York was all set to hold its primary election as scheduled on June 28 when word came down from the New York Court of Appeals: The state’s Democratic-drawn congressional map was an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unconstitutional partisan gerrymander</a> and would have to be redrawn. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The move threw both the calendar and campaigns into chaos. The need for more time to draw a new map led to the <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/news/2022/04/29/ny-s-congressional--state-primaries-to-be-held-aug--23--judge-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postponement of New York’s primaries</a> for Congress<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for the state Senate, whose map was also thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> to Aug. 23 — this Tuesday. And the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/court_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new map</a> has radically changed the configuration of several districts, separating many incumbents from their geographic base and setting off a game of electoral musical chairs. As a result, at least one incumbent, and possibly as many as five, will lose their primaries.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, there’s the usual menagerie of competitive primaries for rare open seats, plus two special elections that will continue to shed light on whether the national political environment has shifted toward Democrats in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson. So without further ado, here are all the races you should be watching in New York this week.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242584954-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242584954-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242584954-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242584954-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Redistricting may have united the Upper West Side and Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York’s 12th District, but it has also pitted two longtime Democratic representatives, Jerrold Nadler and Carolyn Maloney, against each other. <p>Jeenah Moon / The Washington Post / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 22nd and 23rd congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reason we know at least one incumbent will lose their primary? Two of them are running against each other in the Democratic primary for New York’s <strong>12th District</strong>. Rep. Jerrold Nadler has represented the Upper West Side of Manhattan for 30 years, while Rep. Carolyn Maloney has represented the Upper East Side for virtually the same amount of time.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were first elected in 1992, but because Nadler’s district was vacant at the time, he was sworn in two months before Maloney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> But this year, the two neighborhoods were (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/21/only-new-york-upper-west-sides-nadler-taking-upper-east-sides-maloney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite controversially</a>) drawn into the same seat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On paper, Maloney should be the favorite: She has outraised Nadler <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY14037/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.0 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY17071/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.9 million</a>, and 61 percent of the new district’s residents were also in her old district (the remaining 39 percent were in Nadler’s). However, not everyone in Maloney’s old district loves her; in 2020, she barely survived a primary challenge from attorney Suraj Patel. Though redistricting removed the most pro-Patel parts of Maloney’s old district (Queens and Brooklyn), Maloney defeated Patel only 50 percent to 37 percent in the Manhattan portion of the district in 2020. And much to Maloney’s chagrin, Patel is running here again in 2022, and he’s raised a serious amount of money too (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NY12129/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ideology hasn’t been a major dividing line in the race, though. All three candidates support liberal policies, and both Nadler and Maloney have snagged major progressive endorsements: <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1536695096632037376?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Elizabeth Warren</a> and the <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/01/jerry-nadler-gets-working-families-party-endorsement-over-carolyn-maloney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Families Party</a> for Nadler, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-election-2022-rep-carolyn-maloney-gloria-steinem-endorsement-20220126-xvffiqpepfaafigofd6sy2zltm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gloria Steinem</a> for Maloney. Instead, they’ve been campaigning more on identity. In a district with a significant Jewish population, Nadler has emphasized that he is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/nyregion/jewish-congress-nadler-nyc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last Jewish person representing New York City in the House</a>. Maloney, who shattered multiple glass ceilings early in her career, has argued that the Dobbs decision has made it especially important to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/nyregion/carolyn-maloney-women-nadler.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">send a woman to Congress</a>. And the 38-year-old Patel is running against the two septuagenarians on an implicit message of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/nyregion/suraj-patel-nadler-maloney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generational change</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the campaign’s closing days, Nadler has started to break out of the pack. In early August, Maloney had to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/carolyn-maloney-apologizes-to-joe-biden-for-saying-he-won-t-run-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apologize</a> after her opponents <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/08/03/maloney-attempts-to-clean-up-comments-about-biden-s-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pounced on her</a> for a debate answer in which she said she didn’t think President Biden would run for reelection. Nadler also picked up two potentially meaningful endorsements: one from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/opinion/new-york-congress-jerrold-nadler.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, the other from <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/08/15/schumer-endorses-nadler-over-maloney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer</a>. The <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/new-york-district-12-poll-nadler-extends-lead-over-maloney-and-patel-in-ny-12-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent polling</a> (fielded Aug. 12-17 by Emerson College) now gives Nadler 43 percent support, Maloney 24 percent and Patel 14 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting could also cost Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones his seat — but, in a twist, because he tried to <em>avoid</em> a member-versus-member primary. When New York’s new congressional map was finalized, Jones’s neighbor, Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (no relation to Carolyn), got drawn out of his 18th District into Jones’s 17th District. Despite the fact that 74 percent of Maloney’s constituents remained in the 18th, Maloney quickly announced he would run for reelection in the (bluer) 17th — <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/us-elections-government/ny-mondaire-jones-sean-patrick-maloney-democratic-redistricting-20220517-rzoghopsmrbclglt2tkdaybeju-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without, Jones said, giving him a heads-up</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That left Jones, a progressive rising star and one of the two <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/03/mondaire-jones-congress-house-of-representatives/4112104001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first openly gay Black members of Congress</a>, with only bad choices about where to run for reelection. Ultimately, he made the surprising decision to move <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1527872550696628224?s=20&amp;t=TCZRffNPPuWFa1GakKLanw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an hour’s drive south</a> and run in the deep-blue <strong>10th District</strong> in the heart of New York City — a seat with zero overlap with his political base.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22227694218105-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22227694218105-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22227694218105-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22227694218105-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>State Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou and Rep. Mondaire Jones are two of the 13 names that will appear on the ballot for New York’s 10th District, making it one of the most hotly contested primaries of the night. <p>Mary Altaffer / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Problem is, lots of ambitious local politicians have also had their eye on this (previously) open seat. For instance, state Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou has eaten into Jones’s progressive support, sporting <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/08/endorsements-new-yorks-10th-congressional-district/374474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a> from the Working Families Party and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. New York City Council member Carlina Rivera is also running with the support of <a href="https://www.amny.com/politics/speaker-adrienne-adams-endorses-carlina-rivera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influential local leaders</a>, one of the state’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/07/05/seiu-1199-backs-carlina-rivera-in-crowded-dem-primary-ny-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most powerful unions</a> and several Hispanic groups, one of which is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/18/latino-pac-drops-500-000-in-last-minute-ad-buy-for-new-york-congressional-candidate-00052438" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending $500,000</a> on her behalf. Meanwhile, former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, who at the time of her election in 1972 was the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Oral-History/Women/Representative-Holtzman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youngest woman</a> ever elected to Congress,<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That distinction is &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/2018/11/07/pardee-school-alumna-youngest-woman-ever-elected-to-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;now held&lt;/a&gt; by fellow New Yorker Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>8</sup></a> is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/23/nyregion/liz-holtzman-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking a comeback</a> after 42 years away from Washington. State Assembly member Jo Anne Simon could also be boosted by the fact that she’s the only candidate who currently holds office on the Brooklyn side of the district. And even former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio briefly ran for the seat, although he <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/de-blasio-drops-out-of-crowded-congressional-race-citing-low-poll-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> in July due to lack of support.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the home stretch of the campaign has been defined by yet another candidate: former federal prosecutor Daniel Goldman, who served as the lead Democratic counsel for then-President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial. Goldman has already used his personal wealth (he is an heir to the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/21/denim-dynasty-cash-among-ny-10-contributions-flowing-from-outside-the-district-00046920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Levi Strauss jeans fortune</a>) to raise <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY10308/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.4 million</a> for his campaign in the span of just two months (Jones, at <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY17174/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.6 million</a>, was the only other candidate to raise more than $640,000). And after spending at least <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/11/goldman-fcc-ny-10-00050938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.8 million</a> on TV ads, Goldman appears to have jumped out to a small lead: An <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/new-york-district-10-primary-poll-goldman-leads-pack-while-niou-rivera-and-jones-remain-top-tier-contenders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College poll</a> conducted Aug. 10-13 put Goldman at 22 percent support, Niou at 17 percent, Jones at 13 percent, Rivera at 13 percent, Simon at 6 percent and Holtzman at 4 percent. On Aug. 13, Goldman also snagged the coveted endorsement of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/opinion/new-york-congress-dan-goldman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, likely tipping even more voters in his direction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back in the <strong>17th District</strong>, though, Sean Patrick Maloney may not get off scot-free. Many progressives resented Maloney’s strong-arming of Jones, and one of them, state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/nyregion/biaggi-sean-patrick-maloney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to run against him</a>. Biaggi has experience unseating powerful incumbents — in 2018, she defeated a former leader of the Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway group of Democratic state senators who formed a governing coalition with Republicans — and progressives like the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/13/wfp-to-drop-maloney-endorsement-and-back-biaggi-00039040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Families Party</a> and <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/inside-city-hall/2022/06/07/aoc-endorses-biaggi-in-primary-against-dccc-chair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> are solidly in her corner.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1415436381-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1415436381-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1415436381-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1415436381-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney’s decision to run in New York’s 17th District, currently represented by Rep. Mondaire Jones, has earned him the ire of progressives, one of whom, state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, is challenging him for the seat. <p>Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Maloney <a href="https://hvmag.com/archive/congressman-sean-patrick-maloney-mr-pragmatic-goes-back-to-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started his House career</a> as a moderate, but he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/us/politics/ocasio-cortez-maloney-new-york-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sounded more liberal lately</a>. He is, however, an establishment Democrat through and through: He chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and former President Bill Clinton (who lives in the newly drawn district) has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/nyregion/maloney-clinton-endorsement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a>. Those connections have helped Maloney handily outraise Biaggi, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY22139/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.0 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY03196/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$807,000</a>. Additionally, any disadvantage Maloney has from representing only 25 percent of the new district’s residents is nullified by the fact that Biaggi’s Senate district does not overlap at all with the new 17th. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unsurprisingly, then, both campaigns released <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-369c-d60a-a1fe-76bcde140000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-369e-d7d7-a3c2-f69e2c270000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> in July giving Maloney the lead — though of course, they disagreed on its size. Averaging the two gives Maloney 43 percent and Biaggi 20 percent; however, 38 percent of voters were still undecided. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given his access to money and his more moderate reputation, Maloney would likely be Democrats’ stronger candidate here in the fall. And with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> of D+7, this district <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be vulnerable</a> in a pro-Republican midterm environment. For their part, the GOP has a five-way primary for the seat, with state Assembly member Michael Lawler the apparent front-runner. He has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY17162/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$519,000</a>, more than twice the (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY16099/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly self-funded</a>) total of his closest opponent, Somers Council member William Faulkner.</p>

Jamaal Bowman is the latest member of the progressive “Squad” to face a nontrivial primary challenge from their right. <p>Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The final incumbent in potential danger on Tuesday is Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman in New York’s <strong>16th District</strong>. A member of “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Squad</a>,” a group of progressive lawmakers of color, Bowman successfully primaried then-Rep. Eliot Engel from the left two years ago. But as such, Bowman still has enemies within the party, and he faces two nontrivial challengers: Westchester County legislators Vedat Gashi and Catherine Parker. Gashi boasts <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/08/vedat-gashi-eliot-engel-jamaal-bowman-congress-primary-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engel’s endorsement</a> and has outraised Parker <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY16081/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$838,000</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY17281/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$374,000</a>, so he looks like the more serious threat to Bowman. However, the split in the anti-progressive vote will likely redound to the incumbent’s already-considerable advantage. His <a href="https://bowmanforcongress.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a> run the gamut from Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Sen. Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, and he has raised more money (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY16143/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.6 million</a>) than Gashi and Parker combined.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next up are the several districts whose incumbents simply aren’t running for reelection, opening the door to primary scrums. Take the <strong>1st District</strong>, a Long Island seat from which Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin is retiring to run for governor. The Suffolk County Republican Party’s executive committee <a href="https://riverheadlocal.com/2022/02/22/in-race-to-succeed-zeldin-in-ny-01-as-democrats-gear-up-for-primary-county-republican-leadership-unites-behind-one-candidate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously endorsed</a> Nick LaLota, the chief of staff of the county legislature, in the Republican primary back in February, but then cryptocurrency trader Michelle Bond jumped into the race in May. Since then, Bond has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY01257/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.1 million</a> (including more than $800,000 of her own money), more than twice LaLota’s total (almost <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY01190/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$485,000</a>). Super PACs — including a pro-cryptocurrency group <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/160714/crypto-booster-michelle-bond-is-running-for-congress-with-help-from-her-ftx-exec-boyfriend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded by Bond’s boyfriend</a>! — have also spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NY01&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> to help Bond win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The campaign has <a href="https://www.newsday.com/opinion/the-point/the-point-newsday-nick-lalota-michelle-bond-1st-congressional-district-o7kc32fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devolved into a series of attacks</a> over both candidates’ past work for Democrats and weak ties to the district (LaLota lives outside its boundaries; Bond just moved there this year). But while both candidates have tied themselves to Trump, the extreme pro-Trump group <a href="https://www.newsday.com/opinion/the-point/the-point-newsday-long-island-loud-majority-kevin-smith-shawn-farash-cait-corrigan-o7kc32fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long Island Loud Majority</a> is in Bond’s corner. That may prove damaging, however, if she advances to the general election against presumptive Democratic nominee Bridget Fleming, given that this R+5 seat is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to be competitive this year</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A similar battle between Trumpy and Trumpier is unfolding in another open Republican primary on the opposite end of the state: in the <strong>23rd District</strong>, outside Buffalo. New York GOP Chair Nick Langworthy and real-estate developer Carl Paladino <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/nyregion/carl-paladino-langworthy-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used to be political allies</a>, but now they are competing against each other for the right to succeed Rep. Chris Jacobs in this safe-red (R+23) seat. And the primary has gotten <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/12/paladino-langworthy-trade-blows-as-bitter-upstate-ny-gop-house-race-gets-nastier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nasty</a>, with the candidates throwing around epithets like “Cowardly Carl” and “Lying Langworthy.”</p>

(The former president has not weighed in.) But in many ways, Paladino is the OG Trump: He ran a grievance-fueled campaign for governor in 2010 in which he made <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/the-highlights-and-lowlights-of-carl-paladinos-political-career/article_2fccf2e4-6eb4-5840-8b87-90d2a3088a2b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexist and homophobic comments</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SisVSg9jov8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened reporters</a>; in 2017, he was <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/7day-state/article/Report-Carl-Paladino-removed-from-Buffalo-school-11859264.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed from the Buffalo school board</a> after making <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/outrage-and-calls-for-paladino-to-resign-grow-over-obama-comments/article_35135d61-0032-59c4-b759-7e6276836750.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist comments about Michelle Obama</a>. And in this campaign, he has the support of pro-Trump House members like <a href="https://twitter.com/jessemckinley/status/1549052639337336833?s=20&amp;t=PhrrflHYzKj6HSd5-3AdlQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reps. Elise Stefanik and Matt Gaetz</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Paladino has also outraised Langworthy <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY23202/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY23228/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$370,000</a>, but almost all of Paladino’s haul came from his own bank account, while almost all of Langworthy’s is from individual donors, generally a better sign of public support. A pro-Langworthy super PAC has also helped close the spending gap with <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NY23&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> in spending. As a result, a <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/paladino-langworthy-spar-over-campaigns-status-as-primary-day-draws-nearer/article_07003c14-1342-11ed-ba23-9fcf66167600.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from early August</a> put Langworthy at 39 percent and Paladino at 37 percent. A note of caution, though: While the poll itself was not sponsored by any interest group, the person who spearheaded the poll, Barry Zeplowitz, has given money to Langworthy’s campaign and worked for Langworthy previously.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, the seat that Republican Rep. John Katko is retiring from — the new <strong>22nd District</strong> — leans Democratic by 2 percentage points, so the GOP primary to replace him has seen a lot less red meat. Former New York GOP Treasurer Steve Wells is the front-runner there, and he has <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2022/07/cny-race-for-congress-steve-wells-ducks-trump-talk-while-opponent-embraces-ex-prez.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoided talking about Trump</a> on the stump — sometimes to the frustration of voters. That may leave an opening for Navy veteran Brandon Williams, who has embraced the former president (but not his lies that the 2020 election was stolen). Wells has outraised Williams <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY22238/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$691,000</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY22212/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$214,000</a>, but the race appears close enough that the cavalry has intervened: The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House GOP leadership, swooped in last week with an almost <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2022/08/national-gop-group-boosts-steve-wells-with-300k-ad-blitz-as-his-campaign-donations-drop-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300,000 TV-ad buy</a> to help Wells lock down the nomination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Either Wells or Williams will be in for a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tough race this fall</a> against whoever emerges from the Democratic primary here. Four Democrats are in the running, but the clear front-runner is Navy reservist Francis Conole, who has outraised his nearest opponent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY24063/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.1 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY24150/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$133,000</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have a couple open seats of their own. Rep. Tom Suozzi left the <strong>3rd District</strong> behind to run (unsuccessfully) for governor, and the Democratic primary to replace him sports four serious candidates. The <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-election-2022-tom-suozzi-new-york-governor-campaign-20220613-chn534pnyrgcbc5y2hmcowv2nq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centrist Suozzi</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/JCColtin/status/1546483878117900294?s=20&amp;t=i_AZ9Y-uC7nQPw3LKTANbA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> Nassau County Legislator Josh Lafazan, who is also Democrats’ top fundraiser in this race, with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY03162/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.6 million</a>. Lafazan has said he, like Suozzi, would join the bipartisan <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshLafazan/status/1557071069223305224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Problem Solvers Caucus</a> in Congress, but his opponents have <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/3rd-congressional-district-democratic-primary-kaiman-zimmerman-lafazan-darrigo-rasool-p3tp6wgu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked him for being <em>too</em> bipartisan</a>, having once accepted the endorsement of the Conservative Party of New York and supported making police officers a protected class.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hoping to capitalize is Democratic National Committee member Robert Zimmerman, who is close behind with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY03188/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.4 million raised</a>. Zimmerman, with <a href="https://zimmermanforcongress.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a> from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several current and past members of the New York congressional delegation, is the clear establishment pick and has <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/07/one-most-competitive-long-island-primaries-recent-memory-five-candidates-vie-replace-tom-suozzi/375103/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal views</a>. However, the race’s true progressive is community organizer Melanie D’Arrigo, who attempted to primary Suozzi in 2020 and, this time, boasts endorsements from <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a> and <a href="https://indivisible.org/candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indivisible</a>. However, she has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY03075/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than $392,000</a>. Former Town of North Hempstead Supervisor Jon Kaiman, <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/07/one-most-competitive-long-island-primaries-recent-memory-five-candidates-vie-replace-tom-suozzi/375103/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another centrist</a>, is the last serious contender: He’s raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY03170/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $644,000</a> and has the support of the well-organized Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s no independent polling of the primary, but a <a href="https://www.newsday.com/opinion/the-point/the-point-newsday-cd3-primary-robert-zimmerman-lirr-electric-women-candidates-o7kc32fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July internal poll</a> from Zimmerman’s campaign gave him 17 percent, Kaiman 13 percent, D’Arrigo 12 percent and Lafazan 10 percent. Once you factor in the fact that internal polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to overstate their sponsors</a>, that’s consistent with a four-way toss-up. But the candidates should get used to that: Whoever wins the Democratic nod will be thrown into a highly competitive general election. While the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a> currently says Lafazan would be ever-so-slightly favored to beat presumptive GOP nominee George Santos, a more liberal candidate may be an underdog.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door in the <strong>4th District</strong>, Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice is also retiring, and the <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/08/long-island-supposedly-safe-democratic-district-still-reeling-2021-red-wave/375736/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic primary</a> will probably decide who succeeds her in the House (though, with a D+10 partisan lean, the seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t <em>totally</em> safe</a>). On paper, the front-runner is former Town of Hempstead Supervisor Laura Gillen, a self-described “<a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/03/laura-gillen-hopes-to-follow-in-kathleen-rices-footsteps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate to conservative Democrat</a>” who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY04244/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$630,500</a>. However, some observers think New York Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs is <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/jay-jacobs-rice-corbett-congress-nassau-ioas4adg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">putting a thumb on the scale</a> for Malverne Village Mayor Keith Corbett, who has raised a respectable <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY04269/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$414,000</a>. Despite Gillen’s moderation, Jacobs <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/corbett-congress-4th-district-rice-malverne-t37045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has claimed</a> that Corbett is more electable than she is. (After Gillen allegedly told him serving in Congress has been a dream of hers since she was a little girl, Jacobs replied, “I’m not here to help people with their dreams. I’m here to elect Democrats.”) Gillen’s <a href="https://www.newsday.com/opinion/the-point/the-point-newsday-nassau-redistricting-ny-primary-turnout-laura-gillen-o7kc32fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls</a> say she has nothing to worry about, but we’ll be keeping an eye on this race just the same.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242580180-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242580180-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242580180-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242580180-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Democrat Pat Ryan is facing off against Republican Marc Molinaro in a heated special election for New York’s 19th District, which was vacated by Antonio Delgado once he was appointed as lieutenant governor. <p>Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call, Inc / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Finally, New York will hold special general elections to fill two vacant seats in the House. By far the one that has gotten the most attention is in the <strong>19th District</strong>, which became vacant after Democratic Rep. Antonio Delgado <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-antonio-delgado-lieutenant-governor-hochul-albany-20220525-cj45ukhvonh3nfdaelyq6epyku-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned to become lieutenant governor</a>. Now, Republicans believe they have an excellent chance to flip this R+4 seat. The National Republican Campaign Committee has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cmte=NRCC&amp;cycle=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> attacking the Democratic candidate, Ulster County Executive Pat Ryan, with ads like <a href="https://nrcc.org/2022/08/03/new-ny-19-tv-ad-criminals-and-coddlers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> focused on public safety. Meanwhile, Republican Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro is a GOP rising star who still garners name recognition for his unsuccessful 2018 gubernatorial campaign, when he carried this district by <a href="https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2018/general/2018GovByCD.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 percentage points</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All we have to go off here are internal polls, but we can triangulate that Molinaro is probably a slight favorite. In late July, a <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/02/marc-molinaro-leads-pat-ryan-in-ny-congressional-race-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll commissioned by a pro-Molinaro group</a> found the Republican ahead 50 percent to 40 percent. But then, in early August, a <a href="https://twitter.com/mahoneyw/status/1559233246721974277?s=20&amp;t=q_RPwV3F_nJuRJwQVDijfA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCCC poll</a> put Molinaro at 46 percent and Ryan at 43 percent. Since each of those polls is probably a bit biased toward their side, we can guesstimate that Molinaro’s real lead is in the mid-single digits. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is actually a chance that both Molinaro and Ryan are in Congress next year. That’s because this special election is for the old, pre-redistricting 19th District — but the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new congressional map</a> that takes effect for November’s election carves that district up. Ryan is seeking a full term in the new <strong>18th District</strong>, the district Sean Patrick Maloney left behind. (That means Ryan is running in a Democratic primary in a different district at the same time he is competing in this special election. However, he shouldn’t have much trouble defeating his two underfunded opponents, CNN contributor Aisha Mills and financial adviser Moses Mugulusi.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Molinaro is seeking a full term in the <strong>new 19th District</strong>, where he is unopposed in the Republican primary, but in this district, there <em>is</em> a primary to watch on the Democratic side. Attorney Josh Riley has raised the most cash overall (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NY22177/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.4 million</a>), but business owner Jamie Cheney has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY19135/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $631,000</a> in just three months of campaigning — a faster <em>rate</em> of fundraising.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday’s other special election is in the <strong>old 23rd District</strong>, from which Republican Rep. Tom Reed <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/05/10/ny-rep-tom-reed-resigns-cites-extremism-in-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned in May</a> in order to take a job at a lobbying firm. (That said, Reed was already <a href="https://www.localsyr.com/news/local-news/rep-tom-reed-apologizes-after-sexual-harassment-allegations-wont-run-for-governor-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not running for reelection</a> in light of allegations that he had made unwanted sexual advances toward a lobbyist.) Given the seat’s R+15 partisan lean, Steuben County Republican Party Chair Joe Sempolinski is the odds-on favorite to defeat Tioga County Democratic Committee Chair Max Della Pia (however, because Sempolinski is not running in the regularly scheduled primary, he would serve in Congress for only a few months). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’re still watching the margin, though, because of what it could say about the national political environment. When one party consistently does better in special elections than the partisan lean of districts would suggest, it has historically been a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good sign for that party</a> in the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming midterms</a>. And while special elections overall since Biden’s inauguration <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-can-special-elections-so-far-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t advantaged one party over the other</a>, things may have shifted since the Dobbs decision in late June. Democrats outperformed their partisan baseline in the two special elections following the decision. The margin in Nebraska’s 1st District was 12 points better for Democrats than partisan lean would have predicted, and the margin in Minnesota’s 1st was 11 points better.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That said, last Tuesday, Alaska held a special House election where <em>Republicans</em> are currently doing 8 points better than partisan lean would suggest — but it’s hard to know how much stock to put in that. That election used ranked-choice voting, and the ranked-choice tabulations haven’t taken place yet (that 8-point overperformance is based solely on voters’ first-place votes). In addition, many absentee ballots still haven’t been counted yet, so the margin of first-place votes will probably change as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is where the special elections in New York will come in handy. They’ll give us two more data points, allowing us to say with more certainty whether the political winds have shifted. If Democrats win in the 19th District and come within, say, single digits in the 23rd, it will be a strong sign that the Dobbs decision really has given Democrats a shot in the arm. If not, though, we may not be in a Democratic-leaning political environment after all.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Ohio is the type of Senate race that Democrats shouldn’t have much business competing in. The state is increasingly red, having voted for former President Donald Trump by 8 percentage points in 2020. True, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown was reelected in Ohio in 2018 — but that was in a strongly Democratic environment that is unlikely to be replicated this November, in what’s expected to be a Republican-leaning year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan had led in five consecutive polls since late July until an <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/ohio-2022-jd-vance-leads-tim-ryan-in-competitive-bid-for-us-senate-gov-dewine-holds-16-point-lead-over-democratic-challenger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College poll this week</a> put J.D. Vance — the Trump-endorsed venture capitalist and author of “Hillbilly Elegy” — ahead. Ryan still holds a narrow 1-point lead in our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-19-at-7.43.46-AM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-19-at-7.43.46-AM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-19-at-7.43.46-AM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-19-at-7.43.46-AM.png?w=1424 2x"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our election forecast is … confused</a>. The Lite version of our forecast, which just uses the polls, sticks to our polling average and has Ryan as a slight 56 percent favorite.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All odds as of 9 a.m. on Aug. 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> The Classic version, which incorporates “fundamentals” such as Ohio’s Republican lean and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/06/tim-ryan-turned-his-race-surprise-senate-battleground-00050187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan’s fundraising advantage so far</a>, puts Ryan’s chances at 39 percent and Vance as a slight favorite. And the Deluxe forecast, which also accounts for <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expert race ratings</a> — in essence, the conventional wisdom that the race is an uphill climb for Democrats — has Ryan’s chances at 21 percent, making Vance a clear favorite.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ll save the value of expert ratings and the differences between the Classic and Deluxe versions of the forecast for another time. But suffice it to say that they do add to our forecast’s accuracy — or at least they’re supposed to. So there’s no need to, say, blend the Classic and Deluxe forecasts together; the Deluxe forecast should be the one you’d bet on. It already puts the “right” amount of weight on the expert ratings, based on what would have produced the best forecasts empirically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even a 21 percent chance isn’t nothing. So let’s step back and ask a more basic question: Is it <em>plausible</em> that Ryan could win in a state like Ohio in a political environment like the one we’re likely to see in November?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ohio is 12.4 points more Republican than the country as a whole, based on FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric, which is derived from the past two presidential elections and recent state legislative elections.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> And it’s not as though Ohio just had a special thing for Trump, either; lately, it’s been GOP across the board, except for Brown. All of its statewide elected officeholders are Republicans, and both the state House and Senate are strongly Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To better understand the odds Ryan faces, we can create what I call a “simple fundamentals” forecast by adding a state’s partisan lean to the generic congressional ballot’s margin, or the margin by which one of the two parties is winning the race for Congress. (This differs from the more complicated fundamentals formula that our forecast uses, but it still serves as a good sanity check.) And if we add Ohio’s 12.4-point Republican lean to Democrats’ 0.5-point <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead on the generic ballot</a>, the simple fundamentals forecast predicts that Vance will win by 11.9 points.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the generic ballot margin favors Democrats, we actually subtract D+0.5 from R+12.4 for R+11.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But of course, the political climate may not look like this by November. Our forecast, for instance, still thinks it’s more likely than not that the political environment ends up being somewhat Republican leaning. And if, say, the environment winds up favoring the GOP by 3 points, the simple fundamentals forecast would predict Vance wins by around 15 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This raises the question of whether there are recent examples of a Senate candidate outperforming the simple fundamentals forecast by 15 points? Or for that matter — let’s say the political climate remains pretty decent for Democrats — even 10 or 12 points?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The short answer is: Yes. But 10 points versus 15 points makes a pretty big difference.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s go back to the last midterm in 2018. Here’s what a simple fundamentals forecast would have shown in each Senate race (excluding a handful of unconventional races)<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Vermont and Maine, the winning candidate was technically an independent, although both Sens. Bernie Sanders and Angus King caucus with the Democrats. There was no Republican candidate in California. In the Mississippi special election, a nonpartisan election was held on Nov. 6 with a runoff later. And in New Mexico, Libertarian Gary Johnson was a significant factor, receiving 15 percent of the vote. We’ve excluded these Senate races from our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> based on FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean as we calculated it at the time, and the generic ballot, which favored Democrats by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.6 points</a> that year. (Conveniently, the generic ballot was very accurate that year: Democrats also won the House popular vote by 8.6 points.)</p>

 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Out of 30 conventional Senate races, the simple fundamentals prediction was off by 10 points or more in eight races. Democratic incumbents outperformed the fundamentals by double digits in Minnesota (Sen. Amy Klobuchar), Montana (Sen. Jon Tester), North Dakota (Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, although she lost anyway) and West Virginia — with Sen. Joe Manchin beating the simple fundamentals projection by an astounding 25 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democratic incumbents underperformed the simple fundamentals by at least 10 points in Massachusetts (Sen. Elizabeth Warren), New Jersey (Sen. Bob Menendez) and Rhode Island (Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse), while Republican incumbent Sen. Roger Wicker outperformed them by 12 points in Mississippi.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, what we can learn from the 2018 midterms is that even in this era of high partisanship, meaningful divergences from the simple fundamentals aren’t <em>that</em> uncommon in midterm years. With that said, they aren’t routine either, and they usually require something a little bit different to be going on.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Being an extremely popular incumbent is one way a candidate can overperform the fundamentals, but that doesn’t apply to Ryan. And for what it’s worth, while his margin of victory in his House district was quite spectacular in 2016 — 36 points, in a district that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won by just under 7 points that year — it was less spectacular in 2020, when he drew a more competitive challenger and won by about 8 in a district that President Biden won by 3 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moderate candidates also sometimes outperform the fundamentals, as Manchin and Heitkamp did in 2018, whereas right- or left-wing candidates can underperform them, as in the case of Warren. Does that apply in Ohio? Maybe, but it’s a little bit of a stretch. Ryan’s website <a href="https://timforoh.com/a-post-partisan-populist-tim-ryans-momentim-cuts-through-the-noise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brands him</a> as a “post-partisan populist,” but he’s no Manchin. Instead, he has a fairly typical Democratic voting record — he’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/tim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted with Biden 100 percent of the time in this current Congress, for instance</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, Ryan’s current advantage in Ohio may have less to do with him and more to do with Vance. Inexperienced candidates tend <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-hard-to-win-a-senate-race-when-youve-never-won-an-election-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to underperform in Senate races</a>, and Vance has never run for office before.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/democrats-chance-winning-senate-races-ohio-north-carolina-88658882</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Ryan might also have some success in portraying Vance as being too far to the right — Vance previously <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/j-d-vance-ditches-past-161011851.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported cutting Social Security and Medicare</a> — and Ohio has a history of preferring relatively moderate Republicans, such as outgoing Sen. Rob Portman and former Gov. John Kasich. However, in Vance’s case, perhaps it’s safer to say that his views have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/01/04/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-radicalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all over the place</a> as he was willing to change course to win Trump’s endorsement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, another way to underperform the fundamentals is to be tinged by scandal, as Menendez was in 2018 (although the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/nyregion/senator-robert-menendez-corruption.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corruption case against him ended in a mistrial</a>). But there’s nothing comparable in Vance’s case.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that said, there’s nothing that says you need “one neat trick” to win a Senate race. You can grab a little bit from different buckets. Maybe Ryan isn’t Manchin, but maybe he succeeds in presenting himself as a populist moderate, outperforming a generic Democrat by a few percentage points. Maybe Vance’s inexperience makes him easier to define, and Ryan can characterize him as the <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1522349065736015872?s=20&amp;t=QE6wu5-4btZ6gf42Tl6B8g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worst of both worlds</a>: too much of a sell-out to Trump for Kasich-voting moderates in the suburbs and too much of a sell-out to Wall Street for blue-collar voters in the exurbs. Ohio is red, but it isn’t Mississippi or Wyoming. It isn’t <em>that</em> high a hurdle to overcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So there are two things I think we can be certain about. First, this will be <em>much</em> easier for Ryan to pull off if the political climate in November winds up favoring Democrats by a couple of points rather than favoring Republicans instead. Yes, it’s a small sample size, but there were plenty of candidates in 2018 who beat the “simple fundamentals” by 10 points; only Manchin did so by more than 15 points, however. Second, Ryan would be much better off if the election was held today instead of in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not that I don’t necessarily believe the polls now, although it’s certainly worth mentioning that Ohio is in a part of the country where the polls have done quite poorly in recent elections. Biden trailed Trump by only 1 point in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Ohio polling average</a>, for instance, but lost the state by 8 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if I were convinced that pollsters have fixed their problems in the Midwest, there are a couple of things that would make me nervous as a Democrat. One is the relatively high number of undecided voters in the race. In our polling average, Ryan has 43.9 percent and Vance has 42.7 percent, meaning that 13.4 percent of voters are not committed to either candidate. That’s on the high side at this stage for a Senate race. It may reflect the fact that Vance is not a terribly familiar name, but Republican voters in Ohio may not care once they see the “R” beside it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This relatively narrow polling advantage for Ryan is also coming at a time when Ryan is <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/columbus/2022/07/20/tim-ryans-ad-strategy-right-leaning-ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using his fundraising advantage to dominate the airwaves</a>. Reinforcements are <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/08/national-republican-group-plans-massive-ad-buy-boosting-jd-vance-signaling-deepening-gop-focus-on-ohios-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming for Vance</a>, though, so Ryan might lose that advantage by November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So does Ryan have a chance? Yes, absolutely. But I think the Deluxe version of the forecast probably does a pretty good job of pegging Ryan’s chances to roughly 1 in 5.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In most parts of the country, the truth has been inescapable this summer. As the U.S. suffers through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/heat-wave-northeast-records.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heat waves</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/31/us/california-mckinney-fire.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildfires</a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/us-drought-august-2022-1849377876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">droughts</a>, climate change feels right at our doorstep (and for those of us without air conditioning, doubly so). While climate change is not solely responsible for these harsh weather conditions, it has made <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/climate-change/how-to-live-with-it/weather.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">them more frequent and more severe</a>. And Americans say they are feeling it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A majority of Americans — 71 percent — said their local community has endured at least one of five forms of extreme weather over the last year: heat, flooding, drought, wildfires or rising sea levels, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/08/12/most-americans-who-have-faced-extreme-weather-see-a-link-to-climate-change-republicans-included/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a survey from the Pew Research Center</a> conducted in May. And regardless of the type experienced, a majority of those who had faced such weather said climate change played a role. This is true even among Republicans, who are generally <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/more-americans-are-pessimistic-about-the-impact-they-can-have-on-climate-change-compared-to-three-years-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to believe</a> climate change is happening. For Republicans who said their local community had experienced extreme heat, for example, 79 percent said climate change contributed a lot or a little, while 21 percent said climate change did not contribute at all. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether or not they’ve experienced it firsthand, most Americans are worried about climate change. In <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/08/11140636/2207099_crosstabs_MC_ENERGY_SINGLE_USE_PLASTIC_Adults_v1_CC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Morning Consult poll</a> from July, 73 percent of Americans said they were at least somewhat concerned about climate change, including 39 percent who said they were very concerned. However, in this case, public opinion is split along partisan lines. While 91 percent of Democrats said they were very or somewhat concerned about climate change, fewer than half — 47 percent — of Republicans said the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, many Americans are feeling the heat and understand its causes. But what are they willing to do about it? Well, many are taking matters into their own hands and trying to make more climate-friendly choices in their personal lives. In that Morning Consult poll, 61 percent of Americans said they had changed their behavior “some” or “a lot” because of concerns about the environment. Democrats and younger Americans were more likely to say they’d changed their behavior. Sixty-six percent of Gen Z respondents said they’d changed behavior, compared with 60 percent of baby boomers and 59 percent of Gen Xers. Fewer than half of all respondents said that they stay away from single-use packaging or that they buy items with limited to no packaging. But most Americans said they recycle, use refillable water bottles, restrict their use of plastics and buy items made of recyclable materials because of concerns over the environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, while they’re willing to make these small changes, many Americans are pessimistic about how much impact individual climate-conscious decisions actually have. Just 52 percent of Americans said their actions have an effect on climate change, according to <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/more-americans-are-pessimistic-about-the-impact-they-can-have-on-climate-change-compared-to-three-years-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll</a> conducted in June. That’s down from 66 percent in 2019. And when asked who has “a great deal” or “a lot” of responsibility for addressing climate change, 45 percent of Americans said individual people did. In comparison, 63 percent said the federal government did. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And there’s substantial agreement among Americans over what the federal government can and should do to address climate change, according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/americans-support-inflation-reduction-act-measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> from earlier this month. A majority of Americans supported measures such as incentives to lower the cost of renewable energy and using government funds to promote oil and gas companies to reduce emissions. These policies are popular even among Republicans: 53 percent of Republicans supported the cost-lowering incentives and 50 percent supported funding to lower emissions from oil and gas companies. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Funnily enough, the federal government has already done both of those things — they were provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-sign-major-health-climate-tax-bill-tuesday/story?id=88412221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed into law</a> on Tuesday. It’s the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/business/biden-climate-tax-inflation-reduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most aggressive</a> climate-change law the country has ever enacted, yet many Americans appear unfamiliar with it. In that same Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted a few days before the bill passed the Senate, just 41 percent of Americans said they were familiar with the legislation. So while the effects of climate change have been hard for Americans to ignore this summer, efforts to fight it have been easier to miss.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites </strong></h2>



<ul><li>Given a list of 11 political topics, Americans were most likely to have shifted their stance on foreign policy, according to an <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/16/how-often-and-why-do-americans-change-their-minds">Aug. 3-5 YouGov survey</a>. Forty-two percent named foreign policy, with drug policy (40 percent) and health care (35 percent) not far behind. The least-chosen issue was free speech, at 17 percent. Most Americans (78 percent) reported changing opinions on one or more of the issues, but that figure varied widely by ideology: Very liberal (90 percent), liberal (86 percent) and moderate (83 percent) Americans reported a shift at higher rates than their conservative (76 percent) and very conservative (63 percent) counterparts. </li><li>An Aug. 10-16 <a href="https://civicscience.com/tiktok-rising-as-a-go-to-search-engine-among-young-shoppers/">CivicScience survey</a> revealed that almost 1 in 5 adults under age 25 (18 percent) turned to TikTok first when online shopping. That’s a much larger share than Americans overall (9 percent) or even Americans ages 25 to 34 (9 percent), according to a concurrent CivicScience survey conducted Aug. 10-15. That second survey counted Amazon as the preferred starting point for Americans researching a new purchase, at 46 percent, and Google was a clear No. 2 at 35 percent. </li><li>Texas smoked the competition in a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2022/08/15/texas-dominates-us-good-bbq">YouGov survey</a> asking Americans which states they associate with having good barbecue — 73 percent chose the Lone Star State, compared with its closest competitor, Tennessee, at 37 percent. The poll, conducted July 28-31, posed the same question for a list of 19 cities, and three of the top four were in Texas: Dallas (41 percent), Austin (38 percent) and Houston (37 percent) were highest alongside Memphis, Tennessee (38 percent). This matches <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/consumer/articles-reports/2020/07/21/americas-favorite-bbq-style">YouGov/Huffington Post polling from July 2020</a> that found Texas-style barbecue as Americans’ favorite regional variation (22 percent) over other types like Carolina- (10 percent) and Alabama-style (10 percent).</li><li><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/396893/americans-not-convinced-marijuana-benefits-society.aspx">Gallup polling conducted</a> July 5-26 found that roughly half of Americans (48 percent) have tried marijuana, a share that’s been mostly on the rise since 2013 (38 percent). While that number didn’t change much across age groups, the research found that adults under age 35 were most likely to currently smoke it (30 percent) or consume edibles (22 percent). While there were no major discrepancies among education levels or gender, political leaning was a different story: Experimenting with weed was most common among Democrats (53 percent) and independents (55 percent). Among Republicans (34 percent), the figure just wasn’t that high. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): We know the 2022 midterm elections haven’t happened yet, but this summer has seen an unusual amount of activity on the 2024 front. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Namely, many Americans, including Democrats, are <em>really</em> down on the idea of President Biden <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-unusually-lukewarm-about-a-second-biden-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking a second term</a>, while former President Donald Trump continues to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/technology/trump-search-misinfo-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominate the news cycle</a>. A sizable portion of Americans say they <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/07/2024-biden-trump-worst-thing-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t want Biden or Trump to have a second term</a>, but is there, uh … a path for anyone who isn’t Trump or Biden in 2024?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s tackle this chat in two parts:</p>



<ol><li>First, what is the case for — or against — any other Democratic presidential candidate breaking through?</li><li>And second, what is the case for — or against — any other Republican presidential candidate breaking through?</li></ol><p data-paragraph="main">OK, first up. Is there a Democrat who can take on Biden?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): I don’t think so, Sarah, <em>especially</em> if Trump is the nominee. If Trump announces that he’s running for a second term, I think: 1) Biden will run again, and 2) there won’t be a damaging primary to take him down. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What Democrat is going to take Biden on against Trump? Democrats will coalesce around the nominee who can beat Trump, and Biden has already proved that he can.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): I’m generally someone who thinks the 2024 nominations are Biden’s and Trump’s if they want them, but I think Biden is particularly safe. There just isn’t an obvious Democratic heir apparent. The closest thing is Vice President Kamala Harris, and she’s not going to run against her own running mate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Right, Nathaniel. I just don’t see notable Democrats wanting to participate in a messy, protracted primary against the sitting president. It would be a terrible look for the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/kaleigh-rogers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleigh Rogers</a>, tech and politics reporter): It’s no secret that the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/biden-2024-democrats-search-for-alternative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic bench isn’t very deep</a>, and I’m not sure a serious candidate would want to challenge the sitting president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In an earlier time, I could maybe see Sen. Bernie Sanders stepping up to the plate and attracting a decent share of the vote, but in 2024, I don’t think he’d bother, or be successful.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Sanders has <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-2024/40285647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already said</a> that he will not run against Biden. (They’re friends!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> More like frenemies. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Ugh, we need <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/24/politics/cory-booker-andrew-yang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more political</a> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/10/29/elizabeth-warren-julian-castro-friendship-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friendship stories</a>. …</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst): That’s a good point, Alex, about Democrats likely not wanting to participate in a messy primary. The order of operations to all this is very important. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Trump looms large, that may encourage greater Democratic unity. Regardless, though, it’s very hard to take on an incumbent president in a primary — no incumbent has ever lost renomination in the modern presidential primary era. There have been some primary polls testing Biden against a multicandidate field that <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/HHP_July2022_KeyResults.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have him leading</a> but <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Midterm2022ToplinesMay2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only in the 30s</a> in terms of support. However, I don’t think a crowded field would develop if Biden were running again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, and the incumbent presidents who have faced serious renomination fights (e.g., former President Jimmy Carter) lost their subsequent general election. No Democrat will want to be blamed for tanking Biden’s chances against Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another complication: I know polls show that Democrats largely don’t want Biden to run again, but party elites aren’t acting that way. Just look at the <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/08/03/maloney-attempts-to-clean-up-comments-about-biden-s-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hubbub that ensued</a> after Rep. Carolyn Maloney said she didn’t think Biden would run again in 2024. Her primary opponents jumped all over her, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/carolyn-maloney-apologizes-to-joe-biden-for-saying-he-won-t-run-in-2024#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she had to apologize</a>! To me, that’s the sign of a party united behind their leader. (It’s almost Trump-like!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Yeah, I don’t see anyone running <em>if</em> Biden makes good on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/22/biden-confirm-2024-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his stated intention to run again</a>. But I like to imagine alternate-universe scenarios since “no one” is not a very thrilling answer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Well, if Trump doesn’t run, then I think Biden <em>maybe </em>doesn’t run. (“Maybe” is doing a lot of work here.) But to your point, Kaleigh, that opens the door for other Democrats to enter the race. It’s just that no obvious candidate comes to mind for me currently.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I’m not fully convinced that Biden saying he will run means he actually will. It would be a really bad look for the sitting president to openly say, “Yeah, no, I’m good with one term,” <em>especially</em> at this point in his presidency. But as Alex points out, if for some reason Trump doesn’t run, that does give Biden a chance to step back at the end of this term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yeah, I was going to say there are a couple of pretty big assumptions baked in here. The first is that Trump will in fact be the nominee — we’ll debate that more in a bit!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the second is that Biden actually runs again, as Kaleigh just said. That calculus could change as we get closer to 2024 and Trump isn’t the nominee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, Sarah, I would be surprised if a prominent Democrat runs against Biden. I wouldn’t be surprised, though, if he declines to run for reelection. He would be 86 years old by the end of his second term; it’s just really hard to imagine him serving at that age.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Because campaign decisions don’t always happen in an orderly fashion, it’ll be interesting to see how long Biden waits before he makes a final determination about his 2024 intentions. If Trump jumps in quickly before this November’s election or just after it, Biden will have plenty of time to decide. But if Trump were to unexpectedly wait to announce — or were even to float the idea he won’t run — that could complicate Biden’s decision-making process if he is considering not running again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I guess I’m just skeptical that Biden would throw in the towel without an obvious heir apparent — despite his age.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> I know it’s incredibly early still, but general-election polls show that one of Biden’s strongest factors as a candidate is his performance against Trump, right?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, Sarah, I think Biden definitely benefits from a perception that he is still one of Democrats’ most electable options. (After all, he beat Trump in 2020.) But I’m not sure how much the data backs that up. According to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/585432015/20220801-yahoo-tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Yahoo News poll</a> from the beginning of the month, registered voters picked Biden over Trump 45 percent to 42 percent. But they also picked Harris over Trump 45 percent to 44 percent. That’s not a significant difference. And that’s before even getting into the fact that 2024 is two years away and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early general-election polls are pretty meaningless</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> It largely depends on the pollster as to whether Biden leads or Trump leads, but on balance, Biden may lead slightly more often than not. I do think, though, some Democrats believe anyone other than Biden might be weaker against Trump. It’s a question of the known vs. the unknown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Maybe part of the calculus against Biden seeking a second term is that Democrats just don’t want him to, as Nathaniel and Sarah hinted at earlier. A July <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-president-joe-biden-approval-rating-july-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll</a> found that Biden is facing his lowest approval rating since taking office — and Democrats are a large part of the reason why. Per the survey, Biden’s overall approval rating sits at 36 percent, a <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-president-joe-biden-approval-rating-july-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4-percentage-point drop from the end of June</a>. Most of the discontent appears to be coming within Biden’s own party, too. There was a 9-point decline among Democrats between the two polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, 75 percent of Democrats said they approve of the job Biden is doing as president. Compare that with the previous month, though, when 84 percent of Democrats felt the same. And surprising no one, his approval rating among Republican voters is much, much lower. In July, only 5 percent of Republicans and 28 percent of independent voters approved of the job Biden is doing (which is on par with how Republicans felt in late June, too).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Is it unusual that Biden is this unpopular, especially among members of his own party?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Well, on the one hand, presidential approval <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/cruel-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often declines</a> in a president’s first term. I’d bet, too, that Democrats were especially optimistic after Biden beat Trump and Democrats won majorities in the House and Senate, but that they were then disappointed after Biden’s administration failed to address a number of key issues he campaigned on, e.g., <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062070001/student-loan-forgiveness-debt-president-biden-campaign-promise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a student loan forgiveness program</a>, an overhaul of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/8-experts-say-biden-administration-is-failing-on-immigration-2022-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. immigration system</a>, etc. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, Biden has had to continue navigating America’s response to the pandemic, which has been messy, along with unexpected events like <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/23/statement-by-president-biden-on-russias-unprovoked-and-unjustified-attack-on-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine</a> and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/14/biden-economy-afl-cio-00039580" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faltering economy</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> The fact, though, that Biden’s approval rating is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at 70 to 75 percent among Democrats</a> is unusual. <a href="https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/trump-job-approval/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=100&amp;mindate=2000-01-01&amp;maxdate=2022-08-17&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=yes&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A,A%20-%20D,A%20-%20i,RV,RV%20-%20D,RV%20-%20i,LV,LV%20-%20D,LV%20-%20i&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=approve,disapprove&amp;fudge=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Both Trump</a> and former President <a href="https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=100&amp;mindate=2008-01-01&amp;maxdate=2022-08-17&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=no&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A,A%20-%20R,A%20-%20i,RV,RV%20-%20R,RV%20-%20i,LV,LV%20-%20R,LV%20-%20i&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=approve,disapprove&amp;fudge=0.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barack Obama</a> usually had approval ratings of at least 80 percent or more among members of their own party, although they did occasionally dip below that mark. Where Biden goes from here — back up or stagnant — could be important to determining whether he runs again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Not to mention that until very recently Biden also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the lowest approval rating</a> of any president since the end of World War II. It’s slowly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inched back up</a>, but he’s still underwater overall.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But OK, a lot of you have said there is “no heir apparent” when it comes to a Democrat who isn’t Biden. This isn’t a 2024 draft — soon, right? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉"> — but what does the Democratic bench look like <em>if</em> Biden doesn’t run?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> If Biden’s not at the table, then Harris is an obvious choice. Not only is she veep, but also she held her own during the 2020 primaries and could follow a similar trajectory as Biden himself did, using his record during the Obama administration to build out the basic platform planks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah, Kaleigh. Any discussion of Democratic candidates beyond Biden has to start with Harris. Sitting vice presidents who run to succeed their presidential ticket-mate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-had-to-fight-for-the-presidential-nomination-but-most-vps-have-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost always win the party’s nomination</a>. You’d have to go back to Democratic Vice President Alben Barkley <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/politicaljunkie/2009/07/on_this_day_in_1952_vp_alben_b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 1952</a> — so prior to the modern primary era — to find one who didn’t. Granted, the last person in this situation was Vice President Al Gore in 2000, and he, of course, didn’t end up winning the general election. So there is that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> But Harris’s 2020 campaign <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happened-to-the-kamala-harris-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t great</a>. That said, I did find this survey interesting: A May <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/key-results-may/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard University/Harris poll</a> shows that 19 percent of Democratic and independent voters would want Harris to run if Biden doesn’t seek a second term. (She was voters’ top choice). After Harris, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton (!!) and Sanders both came in at 10 percent, while U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg netted 7 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The only problem for Harris is that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her approval rating</a> is even lower than Biden’s right now. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png?w=1424 2x"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> True, Sarah. Democrats do have other options, though. Buttigieg clearly wants to be president too, and he doesn’t have an obvious other office to run for. Democrats also have a fairly deep bench of governors and such who could run if they want — Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Jared Polis of Colorado, etc.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK. Is it fair to say that we’re all in agreement that there is not room for anyone else in the Democratic primary aside from Biden — unless, of course, he doesn’t run?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> The fact that no one easily comes to mind tells me … yes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, time to talk about the Republican side of things. Is there room for any one else other than Trump?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-republican-rally-ron-desantis-kari-lake-blake-masters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/29/pence-iowa-2024-campaign-00048716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Vice President Mike Pence</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2021/magazine-nikki-haleys-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley</a>, <a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/political-news/2022-03-12/former-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-makes-another-trip-to-iowa-raising-2024-speculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2022/08/11/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-flips-pork-chops-iowa-state-fair-talks-2024-prospects-gop-donald-trump/10298565002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan</a> all seem to be lining up to run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of those, DeSantis is the only one who (currently) seems capable of defeating Trump should the former president indeed run. In fact, if Pence, Haley, Pompeo and Hogan were all to run, that would arguably be good for Trump. After all, we saw in 2016 that the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/primaries/explaining-the-presidential-primary-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican primaries’ use</a> of winner-take-all or winner-take-most delegate systems helped Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/25/donald-trump-is-now-just-a-handful-of-delegates-from-truly-clinching-the-gop-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty handily win the nomination</a> with only a <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plurality of the primary vote</a>. So if you get a number of candidates splitting up the vote not going for Trump, it’s just going to make it easier for him to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> The Republican ticket is a little more interesting. You’re not challenging a sitting president, and there certainly seems to be at least <em>some</em> hesitancy over Trump and the idea that he has too much baggage and might not be able to win in a general election … again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/us/politics/trump-approval-polling-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> from last month found, for instance, that almost half of Americans who planned to vote in the 2024 Republican primary would choose a candidate other than Trump in a primary race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yesssss, Kaleigh. I’m glad you brought up that poll, because I thought that was an interesting way to frame the results, as one could also argue from that poll that Trump is still the undisputed leader. He was first, with 49 percent support, and DeSantis was in second, at 25 percent. No other candidate broke the double digits.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> There is definitely more room for a challenger to Trump than to Biden, but Trump would still be favored. According to a recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/11/fbi-raid-increases-trumps-2024-primary-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult poll</a>, 56 percent of Republican and independent registered voters said they would support Trump, while 18 percent said they would support DeSantis, 8 percent said they would support Pence and a bunch of other candidates all got 2 percent or less. Even if you look at head-to-head matchups between Trump and DeSantis, Trump wins, albeit by a narrower margin. According to that YouGov/Yahoo News poll I mentioned earlier, Trump beats DeSantis 44 percent to 35 percent among registered voters in a direct matchup.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Absolutely, but this point (from the Times reporting on the poll) was an interesting comparison to me: “His share of the Republican primary electorate is less than Hillary Clinton’s among Democrats was at the outset of the 2016 race.” Of course, Clinton ultimately won that race, but it wasn’t a guarantee — Sanders gave her a real run for her money.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Eh, Kaleigh, you can cherry-pick one historical example to make basically whatever point you want to make. The Times could have also compared Trump to Gore’s position in 1999. He, of course, went on to win the primary without much trouble.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, DeSantis is clearly a legitimate threat to Trump; a 9-point lead in the polls is not secure. That’s especially true since Trump has universal name recognition, while DeSantis doesn’t. That implies he has more room to grow.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I know we had a chat back in the day about whether <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trumps-hold-on-the-gop-still-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s grip on the GOP is still strong</a>. At the time, I said that Trump may be weaker than some would like to admit, but after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuesday night’s results</a> — most notably Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s primary loss coupled with the fates of the nine other Republicans who voted to impeach the former president — I actually think it’ll be really hard for another Republican to cut through his power. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, Trump hasn’t won every race he’s got involved in (think <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/26/donald-trump-georgia-kemp-raffensperger/9922677002/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp</a> or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-cheney-and-murkowski-survive-their-trump-backed-primary-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski</a>, who will each advance to the general election), but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-candidate-lost-in-nebraska-but-trump-is-still-winning-most-of-his-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he still has a pretty good track record overall</a> of endorsing candidates that win. Moreover, I just don’t see an obvious heir apparent to the GOP, either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>What you all are saying is<strong> </strong>fair, but do you all not see any evidence of Republicans getting nervous about Trump as a candidate?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The reality is that it’s just very hard to answer this question definitively. I do think we’ve seen some cracks in Trump’s influence, as we debated earlier this year. Polls like the one from The New York Times you<strong> </strong>cited earlier, Kaleigh, also clearly show that Trump isn’t entirely unopposed. There are more subtle things happening behind the scenes, too, like Fox News and the Murdoch conservative empire <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/07/30/rupert-lachlan-murdoch-donald-trump-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly distancing themselves from Trump</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s still too early to place any stock <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in these general-election polls</a>, but we’re not <em>too</em> far away from the point when early primary polls will be useful, and what we’ve seen in our analysis of 40-plus years of early primary polls is that it’s really hard for people who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t household names to break through</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">We knew early on, for instance, that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-weve-gleaned-about-the-democratic-primary-from-6-months-of-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden was the front-runner</a>. So the question for me now is whether anyone on the Republican side can clear Trump’s name recognition, and I don’t know the answer to that … yet.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I think there’s at least some evidence Republicans are worried about Trump’s candidacy. A <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-losing-gop-support-2024-run-jan-6-hearings-unfold-poll-1727112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos poll from July</a> found that about a third of Republicans said Trump should not run again, and that’s an increase from six weeks earlier, when they asked the same question and just 26 percent of Republicans said Trump shouldn’t run. That said, a majority of Republicans disagreed with the idea that Trump should not run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All I’m saying, though, is there may be a little more room for a challenger on the GOP side than on the Democratic side if the presumptive candidate runs again. I wonder, too, whether <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2022/trump-lawsuits-investigations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s protracted legal troubles</a> will affect the share of Republicans who don’t want him to run. Maybe. Maybe not. At any rate, Republicans will likely still face an uphill battle in overcoming Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> For me, it comes down to whether Trump still has <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a favorability rating north of 80 percent among Republicans</a>. Because polls at this point are still largely telling us that Republicans would vote for Trump if he ran again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Admittedly, Republicans don’t yet know the alternatives that will be available to them. But considering <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jun/14/most-republicans-falsely-believe-trumps-stolen-ele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around two-thirds</a> of Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t believe Trump lost</a> in the first place, it’s not hard to imagine a lot of them still backing him once we get into the presidential primary season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> It’s still <em>very</em> early, though! Someone like DeSantis, for instance, has to win his governor’s race first before he can go all in on 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But say Trump did announce now, though, or in the lead-up to the midterms, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/politics/trump-republicans-campaign-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as has been hinted</a>, that would be kind of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-first-2020-candidate-is-hold-on-i-had-the-name-right-here-john-delaney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a John Delaney move</a>, no? Like a little <em>too</em> thirsty?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I’m not sure his supporters would see it that way, Sarah. To them, it might just be starting the party early.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Fair. OK, where do folks stand on this question of whether there’s room for someone other than Trump in the GOP? I think there might be more disagreement?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> It’s pretty clear that there is some room for a Trump challenger. The question is just whether there’s enough, and if so, whether the opposition will be too divided to take advantage of it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I think there is space for a challenger in the GOP, but that challenger will still have a real hard time overcoming Trump’s popularity, and if there’s more than one challenger splitting the few non-Trump votes, it will be a snowball’s-chance-in-hell scenario.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> I haven’t had a chance to dig into old primary polling data yet regarding this question, but DeSantis’s situation strikes me as interesting. He’s a first-term governor who was only a three-term House member before that, yet he’s already polling pretty well in national polls of GOP presidential primary voters. That’s unusual! And I do think it means that he has a pretty high ceiling of potential support even against Trump, and that he maybe could best Trump in a largely head-to-head matchup. But as we’ve all noted at this point, the more candidates, the better it probably is for Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Hmm, I don’t know. I just don’t think there’s an obvious GOP heir to Trump. I know other names have been mentioned, but they just don’t have the same power over voters that Trump currently has.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday was a test for some big names in the Republican Party in Wyoming and Alaska. Most notably, Rep. Liz Cheney lost her primary to Harriet Hageman in Wyoming by an even wider margin than expected. Of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, only two will advance to the November general election, as the other eight have either retired or lost their midterm primaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses what Cheney might do next with her message and what an independent bid for president might entail. They also look at the early vote tallies in Alaska to get a sense of whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski will win the general election and whether former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin will be headed to Washington too.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s political future <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-liz-cheney-cant-rely-on-democrats-to-save-her-in-wyomings-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had long been in jeopardy</a>. From voting to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to <a href="https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1389225154639695881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly refuting</a> his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, Cheney has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-trump-election-falsehood/2021/05/01/7bd380a0-a921-11eb-8c1a-56f0cb4ff3b5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Trump’s harshest critics</a>. Now that outspokenness has come with a price.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The daughter of one of America’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2009/01/15/99422633/cheney-a-vp-with-unprecedented-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most powerful vice presidents</a> lost to her main primary challenger, attorney Harriet Hageman, by around 20 points, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wyoming-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=88249850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on incomplete returns</a> as of 10:30 p.m. Eastern. Hageman’s path to victory was pretty straightforward. She entered the race against Cheney <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-effort-unseat-rep-liz/story?id=79922266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Trump’s endorsement</a> and consolidated support among most anti-Cheney primary voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while Cheney’s loss is particularly high-profile, it is not surprising. Of the 10 House Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who voted to impeach Trump</a>, only two advanced to the general election, four lost their primaries and four didn’t even try to seek reelection, retiring instead.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A question we had going into this primary cycle was just how many pro-impeachment Republicans would still be in the House in 2023. The answer we now know is two at most. Republicans may say in polls that the GOP <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/03/11/biden-viewed-positively-on-many-issues-but-public-is-less-confident-he-can-unify-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should accept elected Republicans who <em>disagree</em> with the party</a>, but there is clearly little appetite for those who have rebuked Trump in this way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, in analyzing why these representatives lost — or narrowly prevailed, in the case of Reps. David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington — there are few clear patterns. The electoral impact of the impeachment vote ranged across the ideological spectrum, from districts that lean Democratic to those that are solidly Republican. For instance, Valadao hailed from the bluest seat of this group, while Newhouse survived in a considerably red district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it’s probably <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/07/24/top-two-primary-in-washington-dethrones-trump-00047532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a coincidence</a> that both Valadao and Newhouse won in states that use a top-two primary system. In that format, all voters can cast a ballot that includes every candidate, regardless of party, whereas party primaries mostly involve voters who are either registered with that party or generally back it and who are voting only for candidates from one party. Still, Valadao, the only pro-impeachment Republican running who didn’t face a Trump-endorsed challenger, <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2022-primary/sov/86-congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely edged out</a> fellow Republican Chris Mathys, <a href="https://www.ourvalleyvoice.com/2021/04/16/chris-mathys-holds-town-hall-in-campaign-against-valadao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ardent Trump supporter</a>, 26 percent to 23 percent for second place in his top-two primary.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrat in the race took first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> Newhouse didn’t do much better, essentially tying with the lone Democrat in the race with <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20220802/congressional-district-4-us-representative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 percent</a>.<br></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, not a single pro-impeachment Republican captured a majority of the GOP primary vote. This amounts to an especially weak set of performances for incumbents, who in most cases easily win their primaries.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It also suggests that Valadao and Newhouse’s survival involved at least a little luck. The fact that Valadao faced two <a href="https://www.bakersfield.com/news/candidates-color-outside-partisan-lines-in-purple-district/article_349eeb16-d32d-11ec-a962-a306c4d7037e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-Trump opponents</a>, neither of whom landed the former president’s endorsement, likely made it easier for him to squeak out a victory compared with someone like Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan’s 3rd District, who faced one <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-congress-michigan-grand-rapids-impeachments-bfbb4564f73f2afdda6c5dbcb969c4ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-backed challenger and narrowly</a> lost <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michigan-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=87750801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent to 48 percent</a>. Similarly, had Newhouse faced just one pro-Trump challenger instead of several, he may have been doomed, as collectively his Republican opponents won nearly half of the top-two primary vote — about twice what Newhouse garnered. But instead, they split the anti-Newhouse vote, and he survived.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Factors besides Trump, though, played at least some role in these primaries. For instance, in the two bluest seats on this list — those contested by Valadao and Meijer — <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2022-07-13/essential-politics-democrats-buying-ads-gop-far-right-candidates-essential-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary meddling</a> by Democratic-aligned groups may have had an effect on the outcome. Take Mathys. He didn’t have Trump’s endorsement, but <a href="https://sjvsun.com/news/politics/in-battle-against-valadao-chris-mathys-gets-a-big-lift-from-nancy-pelosi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside spending</a> by House Majority PAC, an important campaign arm for House Democrats, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;id=1153696525417340&amp;view_all_page_id=228754857151053&amp;search_type=page&amp;media_type=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran ads touting</a> Mathys’s support for Trump. And in Michigan’s 3rd District, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent nearly $450,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/x5XVRDC50Do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running ads attacking</a> Gibbs as “too conservative for west Michigan” at a time when he <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=MI03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had almost no outside help</a> to combat <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meijer’s huge spending edge</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Outside forces aside from Trump also likely influenced the four Republicans who said they wouldn’t seek reelection. Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-will-survive-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced a serious primary challenge</a> from former Trump aide Max Miller, but he also faced redistricting uncertainty, reflected in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/senate_gop_proposal_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial plan</a> drawn by Ohio Republicans that split Gonzalez’s old seat into four different districts (it was <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/14/redistricting-ohio-supreme-court-decision-congressional-map-gerrymandering/9119566002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later thrown out by the state judiciary</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/revised_republican_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a>). Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger was in a similar boat, as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his district was dismantled</a> by Illinois Democrats. The same <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/john-katko-retiring-new-york-republican/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was true of New York Rep. John Katko</a>: New York Democrats sought to draw him into a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/amended_democratic_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluer district</a>, although the eventual map <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was invalidated</a> and replaced with one drawn by a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/court_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court-appointed expert</a>. And longtime Michigan Rep. Fred Upton <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/22/fred-upton-running-congress-tv-ads/6898798001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered running again</a> for a while, even though redistricting <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2021/12/michigans-longest-serving-congressman-fred-upton-placed-in-same-district-as-fellow-republican-bill-huizenga.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw him together</a> with more conservative Rep. Bill Huizenga, who <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2022/03/11/trump-endorses-huizenga-reelection-4th-district/7009427001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump ultimately backed</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet of the six incumbents who ultimately sought reelection, they didn’t necessarily enter their races as underdogs. All outspent their top primary opponents, and they usually had more outside help, too. It just wasn’t enough to overcome the anger within the GOP base over their impeachment votes. Tellingly, all six had faced some sort of official censure by a local and/or state party committee following their vote against Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to November, it’s possible the rebuke continues as only one House Republican out of the 10 who voted to impeach Trump is currently favored to make it to the next Congress. Given the red hue of Newhouse’s seat and the fact that he faces a Democrat in the general, the FiveThirtyEight 2022 election forecast <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/washington/4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puts him as <em>very likely</em> to win reelection</a>. But Valadao is in a tougher reelection fight, which <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s forecast</a> currently rates as a pure toss-up. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s likely Cheney as well as the nine other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump knew their vote was a potentially risky move for their political careers. But in January 2021, few would have predicted that only two would survive their primaries.</p>]]></description>

Rashida Tlaib <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democratic-congresswoman-apologizes-distraction-caused-calling-trump-motherf-n956231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stirred controversy</a> in 2019 for dropping the F-bomb while calling for then-President Donald Trump’s impeachment; and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley <em>and </em>New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/reps-ayanna-pressley-jamaal-bowman-tweet-delete-defense-will-smiths-os-rcna21787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced blowback</a> in March for posting and then later deleting tweets that seemed to defend actor Will Smith for slapping comedian Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Omar isn’t the only one who’s attracted negative headlines over the years. But it does seem as if Omar routinely receives the most flak from both Republicans and<em> </em>Democrats. It’s a hard thing to quantify, but she may even be the Squad’s <em>most</em> controversial member.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, there is no one explanation for why Omar is seemingly so disliked. Perhaps more than her fellow Squad members, she has repeatedly questioned the U.S. government’s relationship with Israel in ways that have angered members of both parties. There was the time in 2019 when she responded to a tweet and said the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group, was “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/07/700901834/minnesota-congresswoman-ignites-debate-on-israel-and-anti-semitism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all about the Benjamins</a>,” a comment that angered lawmakers from her own party (not to mention the GOP) because it invoked historical anti-Semitic tropes linking Jewish people with money and power. Then there was the time in 2021 when she compared the actions of the U.S. and Israel to those of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57436573" target="_blank" rel="noopener">militant Islamist groups Hamas and the Taliban</a>. But it’s not just her criticism of U.S. policy on Israel; she’s also had problems with politics at home. In fact, her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/us/politics/ilhan-omar-policing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for a 2021 ballot initiative</a> to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety may have turned off moderate Democratic voters in her primary last Tuesday, for example. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many members of the Squad have experienced <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/14/trump-congress-go-back-where-they-came-from-1415692" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist attacks</a>, but as a Muslim woman born in Somalia, Omar may be uniquely vulnerable to a particularly toxic mix of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007372113/trump-biden-ilhan-omar-minnesota.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virulence and xenophobia</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The fact that Omar still wears the hijab is a reminder that she’s maybe ‘not one of us’ or that she’s different,” said <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/mdminta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Minta</a>, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, who specializes in congressional politics as well as race and ethnic politics. In fact, Omar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/ilhan-omar-hijab-congress-headwear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is the first to wear a hijab</a> in Congress, and while Minta did say that fellow Squad member Tlaib, who is also Muslim, sometimes wears <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46751362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional Palestinian clothes</a>, she doesn’t do it often. “Omar, on the other hand, is a visible representation of what Islam is. She’s also Black. And that intersection makes her a lightning rod,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Multiple Squad members have faced primary challengers this year. Omar and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/02/us/elections/results-missouri-us-house-district-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri</a> had four, Tlaib and Bowman had three<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowman had three challengers until one of them &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Jaffe4NY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suspended his campaign&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>17</sup></a> but Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley had <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2022/02/02/massachusetts-congressional-races-draw-few-challenges-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none</a>. Only Omar has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/minnesota-2022-primary-results/story?id=88109247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come close to being defeated</a>. (We don’t yet know how Bowman will fare in his primary on Aug. 23, <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/04/bowman-challenger-vedat-gashi-announces-470k-initial-fundraising-haul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but fundraising suggests</a> he may have a fight on his hands.) Still, Bush <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/missouri-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=87750676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beat her nearest primary opponent</a> by about 43 percentage points; Tlaib won <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michigan-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=87750801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by about 41 points</a>. Omar, however, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/09/us/elections/results-minnesota-us-house-district-5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won by only 2 points</a>. In fact, Omar is the <em>only</em> Squad member to face back-to-back competitive primaries <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/31/18014442/midterms-election-2018-ilhan-omar-minnesota-5th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following her initial 2018 win.</a></p>

</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">Unpacking why Omar’s most recent primary was so close, though, is hard for the reasons I cited earlier. “Anti-Muslim sentiment certainly plays a role,” said <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/shadi-hamid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadi Hamid</a>, a senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution who studies the intersection of religion and politics. “But it’s hard to know <em>how </em>much it plays a role in this specific case because you would have to disentangle that from the fact that [Omar’s] outspoken; she’s controversial; she wears the hijab and talks about Israel more than most members of Congress.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The University of Minnesota’s Minta, however, pointed to a number of missteps Omar had made at home. <a href="https://www.startribune.com/divided-left-field-of-minneapolis-mayoral-hopefuls-have-unified-message-don-t-rank-frey/600107813/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For instance, she didn’t back</a> Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s reelection bid in part because he <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/rep-omar-endorses-2-frey-opponents-for-minneapolis-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t support the amendment change</a> to replace the city’s police department. Frey, in turn, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-mayor-jacob-frey-other-west-metro-mayors-endorse-don-samuels-over-rep-ilhan-omar/600195677/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Omar’s main primary opponent</a>, former Minneapolis City Council and school board member Don Samuels.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No relation to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> There’s not a ton of recent polling on Frey, but a <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/politics/minneapolis-voters-split-on-frey-unfavorable-view-of-city-council/89-9a1c639f-8072-4c4d-a85b-50cee01d8465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September survey suggests</a> that a majority of the city’s Black voters view him in a favorable light. “I think that having the incumbent mayor against you may have divided Omar’s coalition,” Minta said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Samuels also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ilhan-omar-faces-primary-challenger-hopes-find-weakness/story?id=88147930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly criticized</a> Omar for her support of replacing the city’s police department with a Department of Public Safety, a bid <a href="https://vote.minneapolismn.gov/results-data/election-results/2021/ballot-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which ultimately failed</a> by roughly 12 points in November. Minta told me that Omar’s support for this ballot measure could have angered Black and white voters who didn’t want to disband the police department but wanted to reform it instead. On top of that, Omar has continued to call <a href="https://ilhanomar.com/issue/criminal-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for police reform</a>, which puts her at odds with other Democrats in the area who have moved away from calling for sweeping police reform in the years after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-has-and-hasnt-changed-since-george-floyd-was-murdered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Floyd’s murder in police custody</a>. Frey, for example, once promised to reform and rebuild the city’s police department <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-mayor-freys-credibility-on-police-battered-by-false-claims-about-reform/600148638/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but later retreated</a> from this pledge. Samuels, meanwhile, attempted to make the race against Omar a referendum on that November vote <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/15/minnesota-policing-ilhan-omar-reelection-don-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by touting his past support</a> for more resources and better training for police officers versus annihilating the department completely. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Some Black activists in the past have argued that Omar is out of touch with the community, particularly as it relates to ‘defund the police,’” Minta said. “There was also an uptick in crime in some of the urban areas in and around the city around the time when this proposal was going around, and many people still wanted police on the streets to fight crime. As a result, the more progressive messaging on policing was not in sync with some of the city resident’s demands.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It may also be the case, though, that Omar just <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/09/ilhan-omar-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t take her primary challenge too seriously</a>. For instance, Omar and Samuels didn’t debate, and despite amassing a sizable war chest of her own — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/us/politics/ilhan-omar-faces-a-primary-challenge-in-her-minnesota-house-district.html" target="_blank">over $2.3 million</a> — Omar didn’t air any TV campaign ads against him. Samuels was also perhaps a surprisingly strong primary opponent. He had his own name recognition in the community as a longtime resident and activist of north Minneapolis and a former city council and school board member. He also <a href="https://www.startribune.com/samuels-outraises-omar-as-august-dfl-primary-approaches-according-to-new-campaign-finance-reports/600191471/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a lot of money</a> — though <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MN/05/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately less</a> than Omar — which boosted his overall campaign and had the backing of a number of establishment Democrats in the area, plus <a href="https://www.startribune.com/samuels-over-omar-in-dfl-primary/600194820/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the endorsement</a> of Minneapolis’s big newspaper, the Star Tribune, which put Omar in a tough spot even though she was the incumbent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Omar’s struggles at home don’t fully explain what happened last Tuesday or why Omar has faced a primary challenge each time she has sought reelection. Remember, she’s the only member of the Squad to face back-to-back challenges while other outspoken members, like Ocasio-Cortez, have run unopposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That brings us back to Omar’s identity. “She has these various identities that make her really susceptible to being targeted because she’s so visible,” said <a href="https://polisci.msu.edu/people/directory/lajevardi-nazita.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazita Lajevardi</a>, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies political behavior as well as race and ethnic politics. “She’s a woman, first and foremost; she’s Black; she’s veiled, and she’s an immigrant. These four things are in a sense competing for how she can be really attacked, and they make her particularly vulnerable.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Lajevardi told me that Omar’s identity is likely one reason why so many Democrats feel emboldened to challenge her. Omar’s image has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/02/poster-linking-rep-ilhan-omar-sparks-outrage-injuries-wva-state-capitol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used by Republicans</a> as <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/lauren-boebert-calls-rep-ilhan-203009186.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sort of bogey(wo)man</a> since she first won in 2018, and that, Lajevardi said, could buoy Democrats who want to similarly knock her down. It hasn’t helped, Lajevardi added, that establishment Democrats, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/10/ilhan-omar-democrats-harassment-silencing-israel-hamas-taliban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, have also <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/world/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-admonishes-freshman-rep-ilhan-omar-over-israel-tweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly admonished Omar</a>, which could also embolden moderate Democrats with similar views, like Samuels.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While it’s true that Omar’s criticism of Israel may go too far for many Democrats, Lajevardi stressed that as an immigrant woman, Omar’s comments on Israel might be interpreted differently than if they came from someone who was white or born in the United States. “Nativity is super important here because people seem to think that if she questions how the United States might be responsible for any sort of harm or violence abroad, then perhaps that means she’s not loyal to the United States,” Lajevardi said. “When she’s critical of Israel, people aren’t just listening to arguments of somebody being critical of Israel, but the image of her — her body politics and identity — matters, too, in shaping how that message is received.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Omar’s an easy target in a way that other Squad members just aren’t. She is a disruptive representative because of who she is and what ideas she represents. And because she built a coalition with the progressive arm of the Democratic Party, which has an uneasy relationship with the rest of the party, she is an easy scapegoat for both establishment Democrats and Republicans. “So will she get another challenge in 2024? Seems likely,” Minta said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Aug. 16, 1:37 p.m.):</strong> This story has been updated to explain that although no debate took place between Omar and Samuels, Omar’s campaign says she did not decline to debate him.</p>]]></description>

In this installment of “Model Talk” on the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Nate Silver and Galen Druke discuss the news events and polling that have contributed to this change. They also ask whether there is reason to expect the current environment to hold as we get closer to Election Day and whether we should be skeptical of the polls showing Democrats performing well in parts of the Midwest where polls have repeatedly underestimated Republicans.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For months, Aug. 16 was the most anticipated date on the primary calendar. Not one but two of the highest-profile Republican critics of former President Donald Trump are facing the voters this week, and everyone wanted to know if there was any place left for them in the Republican Party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But now, those primaries look kinda … boring. One of those anti-Trump Republicans is almost certain to advance to the general election, while the other is almost certain to lose. Instead, the most interesting races of the week are now those that had been flying under the radar, including a special election in which Alaska could send a Democrat to Congress. So let’s run down the two races everybody’s watching, plus four more that you should know about.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. House, secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, was the embodiment of Republican politics — until Trump came along. In early 2021, she voted to impeach him for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and she has since become the loudest anti-Trump voice within the Republican Party, most notably by serving as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the attack. And she has paid a price for it: In February 2021, the Wyoming Republican Party overwhelmingly voted to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-capitol-siege-censures-rawlins-wyoming-3d2a5ad3377bb748c22f632642ba23f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censure her</a>, and that May, her House colleagues voted to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/12/995072539/gop-poised-to-oust-cheney-from-leadership-over-her-criticism-of-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remove her</a> from party leadership. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And now she looks very likely to lose her primary for reelection to the <strong>House</strong> as well. Initially, <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1420482244334952448?s=20&amp;t=N5ExF8HQFQ6Ria1ckPNoZA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> showed her with a <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1420475475495854081?s=20&amp;t=N5ExF8HQFQ6Ria1ckPNoZA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting chance</a> thanks to a split opposition. However, last September, Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-effort-unseat-rep-liz/story?id=79922266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tapped</a> <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2022/08/10/harriet-hageman-profile-more-to-hageman-than-just-anti-cheney-pro-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney</a> Harriet Hageman as his pick, and three of Cheney’s other challengers <a href="https://sheridanmedia.com/news/58304/three-candidates-drop-out-of-wyoming-u-s-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> shortly thereafter. Though Hageman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/us/politics/harriet-hageman-liz-cheney-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to block</a> the Republican National Convention from nominating Trump in 2016, she has reinvented herself as a hard-core Trump supporter, all the way up to agreeing with his false belief that the 2020 presidential election was <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/hageman-says-2020-election-was-rigged/article_01a1e786-13f1-11ed-b6fc-d32f25c31359.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rigged against him</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">One other notable pro-Trump candidate, state Sen. Anthony Bouchard, remains in the race, but he has received some negative headlines: As an 18-year-old, he <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/us-house-candidate-bouchard-says-he-impregnated-14-year-old-when-he-was-18/article_c3996062-e6ad-5027-96a9-1bcd0f832eda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impregnated a 14-year-old girl</a> who later died by suicide; Bouchard has referred to the relationship “like the Romeo and Juliet story.” His support has dwindled from <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CfG_WYStatewide_PollingMemo_220526.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 percent</a> in May to <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CFG_WY-AL_JulyBrushfire_MQ_20220711.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 percent</a> in July, per WPA Intelligence/Club for Growth polling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now without any serious opposition in the pro-Trump lane, Hageman has zoomed into the lead, according to <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22056168/wyoming-poll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a>. The <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/the-poll-results-are-in-hageman-holds-commanding-lead-over-cheney/article_1f33dfe0-02f1-11ed-8202-7befc0111031.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent independent poll</a>, conducted for the Casper Star-Tribune by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy, put Hageman at 52 percent and Cheney at 30 percent. While polls of House races are subject to a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fair bit of error</a>, and polls of primaries even more so, it would require a monumental polling error for Cheney to pull this one out. Even Cheney herself appears to realize it: She recently released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Nq9SpGzic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defiant TV ad</a> featuring her father excoriating Trump — pretty much the opposite of an effective message in this heavily pro-Trump state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s gotten far less attention, but the Republican primary for <strong>secretary of state</strong> will also represent an important step for Wyoming either toward or away from Trump-style illiberalism. Incumbent Ed Buchanan, who has <a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/laramieboomerang/news/buchanan-my-pillow-ceos-claims-of-wyo-election-fraud-false/article_fb4e5e71-db08-5d6b-b480-62bcfa285e74.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended the integrity</a> of the 2020 election in Wyoming, is retiring, and two of the three candidates to replace him believe, despite the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence</a>, that the <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/dockstader-drops-out-of-secretary-of-state-race-endorses-nethercott/article_dfb939d2-fd87-11ec-ba5e-43337b26b863.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was fraudulent</a>. The stronger of these two candidates appears to be state Rep. Chuck Gray (who was running against Cheney before switching to this race). Gray has <a href="https://www.wyomingnewsnow.tv/2022/08/06/former-president-donald-trump-endorses-chuck-gray-wyoming-secretary-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a> and has also raised the most money (<a href="https://wyofile.com/secretary-of-state-hopefuls-vary-on-compliance-with-desired-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$528,000</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is also one prominent candidate, state Sen. Tara Nethercott, who believes the 2020 election in Wyoming was <a href="https://wyofile.com/election-integrity-front-and-center-in-secretary-of-state-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fair and secure</a>. She has the backing of much of the local GOP establishment, including the president of the state Senate and speaker of the state House. She has also raised a respectable amount: roughly $333,000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No Democrat filed to run, so whoever wins the GOP primary is guaranteed to win in November and oversee the 2024 presidential election in the state. Because Wyoming has no lieutenant governor, the secretary of state is also first in line for the governorship should it become vacant.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, U.S. House (both the regular primary and special general election), governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>Midnight Eastern in most of the state, 1 a.m. Eastern in the Aleutian Islands</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other Trump nemesis on the ballot this week is Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Unlike Cheney, though, the moderate Murkowski has frustrated conservative Republicans for years: She <a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/02/collins-murkowski-introduce-alternative-senate-bill-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports abortion rights</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-skinny-repeal-option-health-care/story?id=48870581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act</a> and has voted with Biden <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/lisa-murkowski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">69 percent of the time</a>, including to <a href="https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-to-support-confirmation-of_judge-ketanji-brown-jackson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm now-Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson</a>. And, of course, she was one of the few Republican senators to vote to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/2021/02/15/967878039/7-gop-senators-voted-to-convict-trump-only-1-faces-voters-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convict Trump</a> for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 riot in early 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In retaliation, Trump has <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/06/18/trump-gives-complete-and-total-endorsement-to-tshibaka-in-alaska-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> former Alaska Department of Administration Commissioner Kelly Tshibaka to replace Murkowski in the <strong>Senate</strong>. But unlike Cheney, there is almost no chance that Murkowski loses on Tuesday. That’s not because Murkowski’s anti-Trumpism is popular in Alaska, though; rather, it’s because of the new primary system that Alaska is adopting this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under the terms of a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_and_Campaign_Finance_Laws_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ballot measure</a> passed in 2020, all candidates for office in Alaska now run on the same primary ballot, regardless of party (similar to the systems used by California, Louisiana and Washington). But unlike those states, which use “top-two” primaries, in Alaska the top <em>four</em> candidates advance to the general election, which will be conducted using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maine-is-trying-out-a-new-way-to-run-elections-but-will-it-survive-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under the old, traditional primary system, it would have been easy to imagine Tshibaka defeating Murkowski for the Republican nomination; just look at what’s probably going to happen to Cheney! But under the new system, Murkowski can finish second (or third, or even fourth) to Tshibaka and still advance to the general election.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1241813087-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1241813087-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1241813087-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1241813087-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Trump-backed Kelly Tshibaka’s primary challenge to Sen. Lisa Murkowski is likely to be one of the biggest tests of the former president’s endorsement power. <p>Patrick T. Fallon / AFP / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">With her <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/stw221frq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal name recognition</a> in the state and massive war chest (she’s raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S4AK00099/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9.5 million</a> for the cycle), Murkowski is virtually guaranteed to clear that low bar. Same with Tshibaka, who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AK00127/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.3 million</a> and, of course, has that Trump endorsement. After that, though, it’s uncertain who will snag the last two spots on the November ballot, as no other active candidate has raised more than $50,000. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, honestly, it probably doesn’t matter. The third- and fourth-place finishers will very likely be the first to be eliminated in the ranked-choice general election; one way or another, this race will come down to Murkowski versus Tshibaka in the end. But among a general-election electorate that includes not just Republicans but also Democrats and independents, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/murkowski-alaska-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that is actually a fair fight</a> — and the exact primary results will be our best measure of its competitiveness to date. (Polling in Alaska is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-polling-in-alaska-is-making-us-sweat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notoriously inaccurate</a>.) Even though there’s not much suspense about <em>whether</em> Murkowski and Tshibaka make the general election, who finishes first (and by how much) could tell us who is favored in the fall.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1407776706-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1407776706-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1407776706-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1407776706-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Sarah Palin may have once won the governorship in Alaska, but the state’s new electoral system — a top-four primary, followed by a ranked-choice general election — could stop her from winning the state’s at-large House seat. <p>Justin Sullivan / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But there’s another unpredictable general election in Alaska this year where we <em>won’t</em> have to wait until the fall to know the winner. After the death of former Rep. Don Young earlier this year, the Last Frontier is holding a special election on Tuesday to fill his seat in the <strong>House</strong> — and the winner could be anyone from a Democrat to a pro-business Republican to the original tea partier, former Gov. Sarah Palin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-special-election-in-alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June primary</a>, Palin finished first with 27 percent of the vote, followed by Republican businessman Nick Begich III with 19 percent, independent Al Gross with 13 percent and Democratic former state Rep. Mary Peltola with 10 percent. However, Gross — who was Democrats’ U.S. Senate nominee in Alaska in 2020 — quickly <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/06/20/al-gross-withdraws-from-alaskas-us-house-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrew from the race</a> and effectively threw his support behind Peltola. Now, a <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833466571448322?s=20&amp;t=Mdl_loHWQsW95XpZR61BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late-July poll</a> from Alaska Survey Research shows Peltola in first place (with 41 percent), with Begich (30 percent) and Palin (29 percent) battling it out for second.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But remember — general elections in Alaska now use ranked-choice voting, so who finishes second matters a great deal. (This is why, in the waning days of the campaign, Begich and Palin have been <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/08/11/why-republicans-in-alaskas-first-ranked-choice-election-reserve-their-venom-for-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacking each other</a> while Peltola has sailed above the fray.) The third-place finisher will be eliminated and their votes redistributed to whomever their voters ranked second. And that could affect who wins. If Palin finishes third, we’d expect virtually all of her votes to go to Begich, her fellow Republican. Indeed, in this scenario, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833483625545728?s=20&amp;t=Mdl_loHWQsW95XpZR61BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a>, Begich would win 55 percent to 45 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if Begich finishes third, a fair number of his voters might flock to Peltola. Despite having <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/04/04/trump-endorses-palin-in-bid-for-alaskas-sole-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>, Palin remains an unpopular figure in Alaska after her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/us/06palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tumultuous governorship</a>, even among Republicans (64 percent of likely voters in the <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833494220304384?s=20&amp;t=Mdl_loHWQsW95XpZR61BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> had a negative opinion of her). That could be enough to do something that hasn’t happened in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1REYGxQTXblXMHmWuyRiYbbaRlhezrFmMfyNJQwGioYU/edit#gid=711118416" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 years</a>: elect a Democrat in Alaska. According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833489212346368?s=20&amp;t=Mdl_loHWQsW95XpZR61BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a>, Peltola would edge out Palin 51 percent to 49 percent in a head-to-head.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If that happens, it would be interpreted as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-republican-primaries-and-a-special-election-to-watch-in-minnesota-and-wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yet another special election</a> showing that the political wind is at Democrats’ backs in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade (even though, in this case, it would probably also have to do with luck and candidate quality). It would also be a <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/08/08/for-two-candidates-alaskas-us-house-race-is-an-opportunity-to-make-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic moment for Alaska</a>, as Peltola would be the first Alaska Native elected to Congress. But alas, we will have to wait a bit longer to find out whether that “if” becomes reality. In the special election, overseas absentee ballots aren’t due until Aug. 31 (as long as they are postmarked by Aug. 16), and the ranked-choice tabulations can take place only once every ballot has been received and processed. Therefore, we won’t know the winner until then. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/mandela-barnes-democrats-best-hope-flipping-senate-seat-88399333</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, Alaskans will vote in the regularly scheduled primary for the House as well (the special election will determine who serves for the rest of 2022, while the regular election will determine who serves in 2023-24). However, this should be pretty uneventful: Given the fact that they already prevailed over a similar-looking field earlier this year, Palin, Begich and Peltola should all easily make the November ballot. And with Gross no longer in the running, the fourth slot in the regular general election will probably fall to former Assistant Secretary of the Interior Tara Sweeney, a <a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/qa-with-2022-alaska-u-s-house-candidate-tara-sweeney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate Republican</a> who finished fifth in the special primary election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the results of the primary for <strong>governor</strong> will give us some clarity about just how competitive this race will be in the fall. No incumbent Alaska governor has won reelection since 1998, and early in his term, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy looked like he might succumb to the same fate: Opponents mounted what looked like a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/governor-recall-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious recall campaign</a> against him after he made <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2019/06/28/heres-a-partial-list-of-the-dunleavy-line-item-vetoes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive cuts to the state budget</a>. However, the pandemic <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-alaska-d60018aa574e2be0048fd5f00eaa238c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-circuited</a> their effort to collect signatures, and as of this spring, Dunleavy’s net approval rating had rebounded to +20 percentage points (<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/07/19/democratic-governors-are-resisting-bidens-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent approval, 32 percent disapproval</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Dunleavy has attracted some noteworthy opponents in his regularly scheduled reelection bid, including independent former Gov. Bill Walker and Democratic former state Rep. Les Gara. Despite having <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/12/31/dunleavy-accepts-conditional-trump-endorsement-tells-former-president-he-will-not-back-murkowski-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>, Dunleavy is also facing challenges on his right from fellow Republicans state Rep. <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2021/11/29/wasilla-rep-christopher-kurka-announces-run-for-alaska-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Kurka</a> and Kenai Peninsula Borough Mayor <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/01/21/reports-kenai-borough-mayor-pierce-to-run-for-governor-posing-new-gop-challenge-to-dunleavy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Pierce</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Dunleavy, Walker and Gara have <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/07/20/dunleavy-leads-early-fundraising-for-alaska-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominated the fundraising circuit</a>, so they seem like they’re in good shape to advance to November. The questions are whether Kurka or Pierce (or one of the race’s five other candidates) will join them and how high Dunleavy’s vote share will be. If he approaches 50 percent in the primary, that’s a good sign that he’ll be able to build the support he needs to win the general election. But if Walker and/or Gara are close behind him, one of them could overtake him in the ranked-choice tabulations.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">We’ll once again be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live-blogging</a> these results, but the schedule will be a little bifurcated. We’ll begin at 9 p.m. Eastern to cover Wyoming and will continue until the House primary is called. Then, because of the time difference, we’ll pick up the live blog early on <em>Wednesday</em> morning to bring you the Alaska results. No rest for the election-obsessed!</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, we took pains to emphasize that, although he was a significant underdog in our forecast, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/im-here-to-remind-you-that-trump-can-still-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then-President Donald Trump could absolutely win reelection</a>. Frankly, I’m not sure we’ve taken the same care this year when it comes to Democrats and the U.S. House. Their chances to hold the House started out in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-in-2020 vicinity</a> when we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched our forecast</a> — 13 percent — and now they’ve <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risen to 20 percent</a> amidst an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improving political environment for Democrats</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-house-change-711-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-house-change-711-2.png"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s still not terribly likely Democrats win control of the House. But it also means that a GOP takeover is far from a foregone conclusion. So, let’s talk about that 20 percent chance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats started out with 222 House seats following the 2020 election, four more than the number required for a majority. According to our model, there’s a 7 percent chance that Democrats wind up with fewer than 222 seats after November but still enough seats to maintain a narrow majority. Meanwhile, there’s a 13 percent chance that they actually gain seats.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or again finish with 222 exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> Those numbers combined give them their 20 percent chances.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Time for a quick historical gut check. In <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/seats-congress-gainedlost-the-presidents-party-mid-term-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 midterm elections since World War II</a>, the president’s party lost fewer than five seats in the House once, in 1962. And they gained seats twice, in 1998 and 2002. That means three out of 19 times the president’s party would have a successful enough midterm to keep the House, or 16 percent of the time. That squares pretty well with our model’s 20 percent estimate. Of course, the closer we get to the election, the more we can rely on data specific to this year — but it’s good that we’re somewhere in the ballpark.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what about the exceptions when the president’s party had a good midterm? Did they have anything in common and moreover, is there anything they can tell us about this midterm cycle? Let’s take them one by one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats’ strong performance in the 1962 midterms under President John F. Kennedy — they lost only four House seats and gained three Senate seats — is often <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/frc2010093001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attributed to the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis</a>, which happened in late October 1962. The Cuban missile crisis might be overlooked by Americans who came of age after the Cold War, but Kennedy himself thought there was about a <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2017-12/features/risk-%E2%80%98blundering%E2%80%99-into-nuclear-war-lessons-cuban-missile-crisis#:~:text=Kennedy%2C%20after%20it%20was%20over,is%20the%20end%20of%20civilization." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 3 chance that it would end in a nuclear war</a>, so its resolution was one of the more pivotal moments of the 20th century.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are reasonably clear parallels between 1962 and 2002, when there was a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge rally-around-the-flag effect</a> following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and President George W. Bush’s Republicans actually increased their House majority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 1998 midterm, however, wasn’t precipitated by a threat to American security. Instead, there were special <em>political</em> circumstances: The House <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/president-clinton-impeached" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched an impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton in October 1998</a> in what would later become the first impeachment trial against a president since 1868.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial itself wouldn’t begin until after the midterms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if we go back to the last three midterm elections before the end of WWII, the last time the president’s party gained seats in the House was in 1934, in what <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/concise-history-of-the-new-deal/new-deal-at-high-tide-19341936/1FFC2FF1ACAD5E86B22CF4C69D5F7E77" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historians interpret as a show of support</a> for President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal program following the Great Depression.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, all these elections featured some sort of special circumstance: the Great Depression, the Cuban missile crisis, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the first impeachment of a president in 130 years. But such a definition is inherently fuzzy as you can potentially retrofit almost any political or news development to constitute a “special circumstance,” in the same way that <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/most-important-election-of-our-lifetimes-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost every election gets called</a> “the most important election of our lifetimes.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take the 2010 midterms, for example. A Democratic president with an ambitious agenda had been elected two years earlier following a global financial crisis. But unlike in 1934, President Barack Obama’s Democrats didn’t gain seats in the House. Instead, they lost 63, the steepest defeat for any party at the midterms since 1938.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Or consider the 1990 midterms. President George H.W. Bush was <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/234971/george-bush-retrospective.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already fairly popular</a>, but there was a further rally-around-the-flag effect following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, sending his approval ratings into the mid-70s before they slipped back into the 50s by November. Still, that might seem to qualify as a special circumstance. Yet, Bush’s Republicans lost seats in the House. Then again, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-2022-be-a-good-year-for-republicans-yes-we-know-its-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they lost fewer seats</a> than usual (eight seats) along with just one Senate seat, so maybe that counts as a partial validation of our theory.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/mandela-barnes-democrats-best-hope-flipping-senate-seat-88399333</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">In any event, if Democrats do keep the House, I don’t think historians will have any trouble giving 2022 the special-circumstances <a href="https://www.deseret.com/1991/9/5/18939671/baseball-drops-the-asterisk-from-maris-record" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asterisk</a>, like they do now for 1998 and 2002. But what is the special circumstance?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It might be noted that the 2022 election is taking place amidst the still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, unquestionably one of the most important events in every American’s lifetime given the widespread death and disruption to daily life. With that said, most people have stopped caring about COVID-19; only <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 percent</a> of Americans regarded it as the most important issue facing the country when Gallup asked about it in June. Perhaps if the delta and omicron variants had never come along, Democrats could have campaigned on some miraculous return to normal. Instead, the return has been bumpy, epidemiologically, economically and otherwise. So that’s not the special circumstance I’m referring to, although the pandemic may have hard-to-measure knock-off effects on politics and society.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nor is the special circumstance an international or security crisis, although there are some conflicts that could boil over by November — that’s part of the intrinsic uncertainty in an election forecast. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine isn’t having any obvious effect on the U.S. midterms for now, but if there were nuclear weapons used or any direct American or NATO military engagement, that could change. Meanwhile, Chinese-U.S. tensions over Taiwan are also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/world/asia/china-taiwan-drills-economy-military.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit</a> there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, I’m keeping my eye on the potential for a special political circumstance, more like what we saw in 1998, when the public responded to increasing Republican partisanship and their efforts to impeach Clinton.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans swept to power in Congress in 1994 on an unusually substantive platform including the “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/01/20/republican-midterm-plan-education-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contract with America</a>,” and even achieved a number of policy successes with the centrist, triangulating Clinton. So for them to turn around and make the 1998 midterms about Clinton’s personal conduct was <a href="https://rollcall.com/2019/09/25/the-contract-with-americas-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably a mistake</a>. Although the Monica Lewinsky scandal seems almost quaint by current standards, the impeachment trial and other investigations into Clinton <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflected a significant escalation of partisanship</a> under then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, one that has continued through today.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, partisanship alone doesn’t guarantee an electoral backlash. Near-universal Republican opposition to Obama’s agenda didn’t hurt them at all in the midterms in 2010. Instead, what differentiated 1998 is that Republicans were on the attack and not merely trying to block Democrats from getting their own agenda implemented. Relative to the standards of 1998, impeachment was a dramatic step and one that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/03/clintons-impeachment-barely-dented-his-public-support-and-it-turned-off-many-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed Clinton to gain significant public sympathy</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-win-ohio-wisconsin-fivethirtyeight-88400821</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">This time, Republicans are exercising power not through the Congress but through the courts: most importantly, through the decision by a 6-3 majority of Republican-appointed judges on the Supreme Court to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn Roe v. Wade</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Immediately after the court overturned Roe, Democrats began to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gain ground on the generic congressional ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they’d support in an election, and it’s now translated into some electoral successes, too. In Kansas last week, voters <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Kansas_No_State_Constitutional_Right_to_Abortion_and_Legislative_Power_to_Regulate_Abortion_Amendment_(August_2022)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly rejected a ballot initiative</a> that would have allowed the legislature to restrict abortion in the state amid <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23290714/kansas-abortion-referendum-primary-turnout-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very high turnout</a>. And in Minnesota this week, Republicans won a special election in the 1st Congressional District by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/09/us/elections/results-minnesota-us-house-district-1-special-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 4 percentage points</a>, a district that Trump won by 10 points in 2020. Likewise, on June 28, just a few days after Roe was overturned, Republicans won a special election in Nebraska’s 1st District by only 5 points in a district that <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/nebraska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump carried by 15 points</a>.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the &lt;a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/election-administration-campaigns/elections-calendar/congressional-district-1-special-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Aug. 9 special election in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District&lt;/a&gt; took place within the district’s “old” boundaries, which Trump won by 10 points in 2020, the &lt;a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/07/06/nebraska-quirk-used-new-map-to-fill-house-vacancy-last-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;special election in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District&lt;/a&gt; took place within the newly redrawn boundaries; if this map were in place in 2020, Trump would have &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2022/congressional-redistricting-maps-by-state-and-district/nebraska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;carried Nebraska’s 1st District by 11 points&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, you can make excuses for Republicans on a case-by-case basis — the Kansas ballot measure was confusingly worded, Nebraska’s former Republican representative <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/notes-on-the-state-of-the-primaries-june-29-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been mired in scandal</a> and that Minnesota district has historically been bluer in races for Congress than the presidency. I’d be conservative in putting too much stock in these since it’s a small sample size, too. But at the very least, these are hardly the sorts of results you’d associate with a “red wave,” and they suggest that something different <em>might</em> be going on.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just the courts, either. Republicans are also aggressively exercising power through state governments, especially on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/us/indiana-abortion-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/25/lgbtq-rights-gop-bills-dont-say-gay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gay and transgender rights</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-anti-critical-race-theory-bills-are-taking-aim-at-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education policy</a>. And although voters don’t regard Jan. 6 as an event as important as Sept. 11 — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/01/post-poll-january-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public opinion about it is also much more polarized</a> — it’s a reminder that Republicans can also potentially seek to achieve power through extralegal means.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If nothing else, Democratic voters have no shortage of motivation to turn out: Many feel as though their basic rights are being threatened, something a party’s voters ordinarily aren’t concerned about when it controls both the presidency and Congress. The “enthusiasm gap” often accounts for much of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the presidential party’s disadvantage</a> at the midterms, but it’s <a href="https://www.lx.com/politics/democrats-young-voters-have-closed-the-enthusiasm-gap-4-months-before-2022-midterms/55009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not clear it exists this year after Roe was overturned</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All that said, Republicans are still fairly clear favorites to keep the House. Notably, President Biden is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite unpopular</a> despite a modest improvement in his approval ratings, whereas FDR, JFK, Clinton and GWB were all popular at the times of their midterms. The public still has very negative views about the economy and <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the direction the country is headed in</a>, and that’s usually rough for the party in power to overcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the circumstances of these midterms are also potentially unusual, with high uncertainty, and that’s why Democrats keeping the House is a thinkable outcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Aug. 13, 2022, 8:50 a.m.):</strong> This article has been updated with a footnote explaining that if Nebraska’s new redistricting maps had been in place in 2020, Trump would have won Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District by 11 points.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Hawaii hasn’t elected a Republican to federal or statewide office <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/05/republican-djou-wins-hawaii-special-037649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2010</a> and hasn’t had a competitive general election for those offices <a href="https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/government-politics/2014-08-14/takai-vs-djou-shaping-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2014</a>. According to our 2022 midterm election forecast, that won’t change this year either: Democrats have a greater than 99 in 100 chance to win the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate race</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s mansion</a> and both <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/hawaii/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. House</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/hawaii/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seats</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Hawaii has also elected some <em>very</em> different types of politicians during that span of Democratic dominance. The state’s U.S. senators, Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/brian-schatz-progressive-senator-reshapes-2020-campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk</a> and <a href="https://voteview.com/person/20713/mazie-hirono" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote</a> like progressives. But Rep. Ed Case is a <a href="https://bluedogcaucus-murphy.house.gov/members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Dog Democrat</a> who was one of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine moderates</a> to hold up President Biden’s ambitious spending plan last year in favor of passing an infrastructure bill first. And, of course, lest we forget: Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-tulsi-gabbard-could-win-the-2020-democratic-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative positions</a> on <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/a-bold-pro-life-move-for-a-democrat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tulsi-gabbard-legislation-hawaii-gender-identity-markwayne-mullin-fdc7d8b0461a54ee88c1a0c85a0893f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ rights</a> and was one of only three Democrats <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/18/politics/tulsi-gabbard-present-impeachment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to vote not to impeach</a> then-President Donald Trump in 2019.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So the Aloha State is the perfect example of why we do so much primary coverage here at FiveThirtyEight. In one-party-rule states like Hawaii, the party in control tends to be <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2022-04-19/for-hawaii-democrats-the-skys-the-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very ideologically diverse</a>, making primary elections extra important. And Hawaii’s 2022 primary election, taking place on Saturday, should be no exception, as Hawaii Democrats will have the opportunity to decide the ideological direction of two high-profile offices where the incumbent is not running for reelection.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to wat</strong><strong>ch:</strong> 2nd Congressional District, governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close</strong><strong>: </strong>1 a.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, seven Democrats are running to succeed the state’s term-limited <strong>governor</strong>. The clear front-runner is Lt. Gov. Josh Green, an emergency-room doctor whose <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/19/hawaii-covid-success-story-322919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proactive response to the COVID-19 pandemic</a> made him a well-known and popular figure in the state. And according to a <a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2022/07/24/hawaii-news/approvals-still-high-for-green-in-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mid-July poll</a> from Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy for the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, 65 percent of likely Democratic primary voters had a favorable opinion of Green. Green also enjoys the support of some of <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/03/lt-gov-josh-green-is-racking-up-union-endorsements-adding-to-his-momentum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawaii’s largest unions</a>, which is notable because Hawaii is the most heavily unionized state in the nation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Business executive Vicky Cayetano isn’t letting Green off easy, though. The former president of the state’s largest laundry company has <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/vicky-cayetano-turns-to-self-funding-for-her-gubernatorial-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donated $1.5 million to her own campaign</a> and raised almost as much as Green overall (<a href="https://csc.hawaii.gov/Report/RPT2021/20220803111832CC11713DIS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.1 million</a> to his <a href="https://csc.hawaii.gov/Report/RPT2021/20220803175407CC10174DIS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.4 million</a>). Cayetano has <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2021/08/30/former-first-lady-vicky-cayetano-officially-announces-run-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never run for office before</a>, but she is married to former Gov. Ben Cayetano. She also co-chaired the 2020 campaign of Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi, an independent who <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/rick-blangiardi-honolulu-mayor-1234884867/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for Trump in 2016</a>. For her part, Cayetano insists her “values absolutely align with the Democratic Party” but also describes herself as <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/hawaiis-former-first-lady-vicky-161300851.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscally conservative</a>, which aligns her with the pro-business wing of the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The third major candidate, Rep. Kai Kahele, has support from many progressive state legislators. He has <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/05/congressman-kai-kahele-joins-the-race-for-hawaii-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decried the influence of money in politics</a>, saying he would not accept donations above $100 and would rely on public financing for his campaign. However, Kahele bafflingly <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/kai-kahele-wont-be-able-to-get-public-funding-for-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to file the paperwork</a> necessary to qualify for public financing, and as a result, he is strapped for cash, raising only <a href="https://csc.hawaii.gov/Report/RPT2021/20220803231634CC11209DIS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$179,000</a> for the cycle. In fairness, he did jump into the race late — just three months ago — but Kahele’s actions haven’t done anything to tamp down the criticism that his heart just isn’t in politics. In April, <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/04/has-us-rep-kai-kahele-given-up-on-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honolulu Civil Beat reported</a> that Kahele had not attended a vote at the U.S. Capitol in person since January and was still working part-time as a pilot for Hawaiian Airlines. (Though this <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/kai-kahele-proxy-voting-hawaiian-airlines-pilor/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially raised questions</a> of whether Kahele was violating House ethics rules by accepting outside income, he has said that his earnings from the airline fell within the legal limits.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22080134/civil-beat-july-2022-democratic-governor-primary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://314action.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hawaii-Memo-Feb-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> of the race show Green with a double-digit lead over both Cayetano and Kahele. The July Mason-Dixon survey, for example, gave Green 55 percent support, Cayetano 19 percent and Kahele 16 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kahele’s gubernatorial campaign has also opened up his <strong>2nd Congressional District</strong> for the taking. Six Democrats are in the running, but the primary will probably come down to just two: former state Sen. Jill Tokuda and state Rep. Patrick Branco.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tokuda is a <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/hawaiis-congressional-district-2-race-veteran-tokuda-vs-newcomer-branco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veteran of Hawaii politics</a>, having served 12 years in the state legislature and running twice for lieutenant governor. She’s also a close ally of Hirono and the progressive wing of the party; for example, the <a href="https://weareprogressives.org/congressional-progressive-caucus-pac-endorses-jill-tokuda-in-hi-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC</a> has endorsed her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Branco has served only one term in the state House and presents himself as a fresh face. He has also tried to turn his diversity into an asset: He would be Hawaii’s first openly gay member of Congress, first Hispanic member of Congress and, with Kahele’s departure, only Native Hawaiian member of Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tokuda has long been considered the front-runner in the race, however. She has outraised Branco <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/HI/02/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$528,000 to $153,000</a>, and a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22082138/july-2022-democratic-congressional-primaries.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late-June poll</a> from Honolulu Civil Beat and Hawaii News Now gave her a 31-percent-to-6-percent lead (albeit with 63 percent of likely voters undecided). However, a <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/08/can-patrick-brancos-mainland-backers-buy-him-a-seat-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cadre of outside groups</a> — from the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to the <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/crypto-super-pac-launches-ad-campaign-in-support-of-patrick-branco-n-cd2-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-cryptocurrency super PAC</a> Web3 Forward and veterans group VoteVets — have spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=HI02&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> supporting Branco or attacking Tokuda. <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/chad-blair-mud-slinging-in-hawaiis-primary-is-getting-ugly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One particularly controversial ad</a> referenced the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and then pointed out that the National Rifle Association had endorsed Tokuda in a previous campaign. Without any more recent polls, we don’t know how much these ads have moved the needle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Across Hawaii, vote centers close and ballots are due at 1 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, so we won’t be covering the results live (that’s prime clubbing time!). Don’t worry, though — we’ll be back at the live-blogging routine for Tuesday’s primaries in Alaska and Wyoming.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/past-cases-reveal-trumps-legal-exposure-fbi-raid/story?id=88190464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago</a>, former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate, with a warrant to reportedly investigate whether he had mishandled or kept classified documents in violation of the Presidential Records Act, which requires presidents to turn over any written materials related to their official duties.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The dust is still settling on what exactly will come of the search — such as, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-believes-trump-held-sensitive-classified-documents-associates/story?id=88276442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what type of classified information</a> does the FBI suspect Trump to be in possession of? But <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/09/48734/3?utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SM-2022-08-US-B2C-DQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling from YouGov</a> conducted on Aug. 9 found that 62 percent of Americans thought it was either “a very big problem” (45 percent) or “somewhat of a problem” (17 percent) that Trump allegedly held onto classified documents after leaving office. That said, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/public-opinion-of-the-mueller-investigation-has-become-more-partisan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve seen with previous investigations of Trump</a>, public opinion is split starkly along partisan lines, and Americans generally <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/half-of-americans-think-impeachment-is-a-bad-use-of-congresss-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remain leery of taking action against him</a>. That same Aug. 9 YouGov poll, for instance, found that 76 percent of Democrats — and 44 percent of independents — said they’d consider it a very big problem, compared with just 12 percent of Republicans. And <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/11/fbi-raid-increases-trumps-2024-primary-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Aug. 10 poll from Politico/Morning Consult corroborates this breakdown</a>: 81 percent of Democratic registered voters said the search was based on evidence that Trump had committed a crime, while only 16 percent of Republicans agreed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We don’t have any other nonpartisan polls yet,<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> but these findings are in line with polls that followed two similar stories from earlier this year. First, in February, news broke that the National Archives and Records Administration had <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/national-archives-retrieves-boxes-presidential-records-mar-lago/story?id=82729844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retrieved 15 boxes of documents</a> from Mar-a-Lago that they said Trump shouldn’t have had in his possession, and then New York Times reporter <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/02/10/maggie-haberman-book-trump-papers?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-maggiehaberman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie Haberman released bombshell details from her upcoming book</a> of the former president clogging a White House toilet with papers he’d tried to flush. <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/national/2022/02_28_2022_complete_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=AEF0D74480E38EB7EF6A0858D7E0529C526027CF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Feb. 16-20 poll from Suffolk University/USA Today</a>, for instance, found that 56 percent of registered voters thought the National Archives retrieving such documents from Trump was a serious matter warranting investigation. But again, there were stark differences by party, with 88 percent of Democrats saying it should be investigated, compared with just 27 percent of Republicans. Still, a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/mfe5ie0pbd/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey conducted Feb. 12-15 by The Economist/YouGov</a> found that 79 percent of Americans thought Trump taking home classified material was more “wrong” than “right” — including 61 percent of Republicans and 91 percent of Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This poll from The Economist/YouGov went one step further, though, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/02/17/most-americans-say-trump-taking-classified-materia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparing Trump’s security violation</a> to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-hillary-clintons-email-saga/story?id=29442707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email system to conduct government business</a> as secretary of state. And what it found is that a similar share of Americans considered both Trump’s and Clinton’s actions very or somewhat serious. For example, 47 percent said Trump’s security violation was “very serious,” compared with 43 percent who said the same of Clinton’s issue. Notably, however, there were stark partisan splits on these questions, with 93 percent of Democrats and 48 percent of Republicans saying Trump’s actions were at least somewhat serious versus 91 percent of Republicans and 56 percent of Democrats who said the same about Clinton’s actions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It remains to be seen what legal action, if any, may come from this week’s FBI search, but public opinion on prior investigations of Trump offers some clues as to how Americans may be feeling about it. Consider special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Following the public release of the Mueller report in April 2019, polls found <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/both-parties-think-the-mueller-report-was-fair-they-just-disagree-on-what-it-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans unable to agree</a> on the investigation’s findings: A Washington Post/ABC News poll fielded at the time found that 81 percent of Democrats said they believed Trump interfered in Mueller’s investigation to the level of obstruction of justice, while 77 percent of Republicans said the opposite. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, Americans have been hesitant to take action against Trump even if they think he did something wrong. For instance, the same Washington Post/ABC News poll found that shortly after the Mueller report was published, 56 percent of Americans said Congress should <em>not</em> start impeachment proceedings, which was 10 percentage points higher than what the poll found a few months earlier, in August 2018. It was a similar story regarding Trump’s first impeachment trial. In January 2020, after the House voted to impeach Trump but before the Senate voted to acquit, about half of Americans (51 percent) said they considered <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/half-of-americans-think-impeachment-is-a-bad-use-of-congresss-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impeachment a wasteful use of Congress’s time</a>, according to a FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll. That said, there are exceptions that show more stringent public stances on holding Trump accountable: A recent <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-the-january-6th-hearings-july-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll</a> reported that 50 percent of Americans thought Trump should be criminally charged based on evidence shown in the congressional hearings on the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, the FBI’s search of Trump’s estate is just the latest in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/politics/list-investigations-trump/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a long list of legal problems</a> facing Trump. In fact, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-expected-testify-wednesday-york-ag-probe/story?id=88162139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not even the only development in his legal issues this week</a>. The question now is whether things will be different in the eyes of the public this time around. But if previous investigations are any indication, it doesn’t look likely. </p>



<h2>Other polling b<strong>ites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Among Americans with social media, over half (54 percent) said their posts don’t accurately reflect their daily life, <a href="https://civicscience.com/how-real-is-bereal-and-social-media/">per a survey from CivicScience conducted July 12-19</a>. And of adults who said they’ve spent four or more hours on social media a day, 66 percent said they felt “very” or “somewhat strongly” stressed in the last week. Those who spent the least time on social media — less than an hour a day — also reported stress but at a slightly lower rate: 51 percent.</li><li>Related to the above, 57 percent of Americans said they wanted to “spend a few days ‘off the grid’ without the expectation of responding to any calls, texts, or online messages,” <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/05/d09cd/2">according to YouGov polling on Aug. 5</a>. This was especially true of adults between ages 30 to 44 (61 percent) and 45 to 64 (63 percent), while it was least true among those under the age of 30 (48 percent).</li><li>Of Americans who’ve been employed, 81 percent said they had quit a job at least once in their life, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/08/09/who-quits-their-jobs-and-why-poll">per a YouGov survey conducted July 27-29</a>. This differed across income levels, though, with those in higher income brackets more likely to have called it quits at some point. Ninety percent of those with a family income over $100,000 said they had quit a job, compared with 83 percent among those with a family income of $50,000-100,000 and 76 percent among those with a family income of less than $50,000.</li><li><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-are-disillusioned-over-climate-change/">Another scoop</a> on sweet treats: Crunch Ice Cream Bars were Americans’ favorite treat from ice cream trucks, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/entertainment/articles-reports/2022/08/08/americans-favorite-sweet-treats-ice-cream-truck">according to July 28-31 polling from YouGov</a>. The survey ranked items by “win percentage,” or how often one treat won against another in a one-on-one matchup. However, the Crunch Ice Cream Bar’s popularity wasn’t overwhelming, coming in at 64.2 percent. It barely edged out the competition, which included Drumsticks (64.1 percent), vanilla ice cream sandwiches (64.1 percent), twist soft-serve cones (62.4 percent) and Klondike bars (60.1 percent). For those of you wondering, the <a href="https://abc7news.com/choco-taco-discontinued-klondike-ice-cream-where-to-buy/12108998/">likely</a> soon-to-be <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/klondike-discontinues-choco-taco-87428650">discontinued Choco Taco</a> came in 11th, with 55.2 percent. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>PUBLISHED AUG. 10, 2022, AT 5:35 PM</p>
<p>What If Democrats — Or Republicans — Had Won Every Redistricting Battle?</p>
<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/ryan-best/">Ryan Best</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/">Nathaniel Rakich</a></p>
<p>Get the data on <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/slanted-maps">GitHub</a></p>
<p>With control of Congress at stake for potentially 10 years, the 2021-22 redistricting process was a pitched battle between the two parties. Both sides fought hard to install maps favorable to them, but in the end, their efforts largely came out in the wash. The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/">new national congressional map that emerged</a> largely preserved the (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/">Republican-leaning</a>) balance of power that existed at the end of last decade.</p>
<p>But what if it had turned out differently? What if Democrats or Republicans — or even nonpartisan reformers — had won every redistricting battle this cycle? How different would the national congressional map look?</p>
<p>We don’t have to imagine. Thanks to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/">FiveThirtyEight redistricting tracker</a>, we have a record of 365 potential congressional maps that were officially proposed this past year. And we can use the best Democratic, best Republican and most competitive proposal from every state to picture what each side’s best-case scenario was this redistricting cycle.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn’t what the national map for the House of Representatives would look like if one party had had free rein to gerrymander in every state. (We <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/#GOP">already did</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/#Dem">that project</a>.) Instead, these are the best maps for each side that <i>theoretically</i> could have resulted from the redistricting process as it actually played out.1 Curious what these alternative political universes would look like? Use the interactive below to toggle between them:</p>
<p>CHOOSE MAPS THAT WERE:</p>
<p>ApprovedMost competitiveBest for DemocratsBest for RepublicansPARTISAN LEAN OF DISTRICTS:</p>
<p>Solid D≥D+15</p>
<p>Highly Competitive</p>
<p>Solid R≥R+15</p>
<p>Competitive D≥D+5</p>
<p>Competitive R≥R+5</p>
<p>MAJORITYThere are 208 Republican-leaning seats, 187 Democratic-leaning seats and 40 highly competitive seats in the approved maps.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that a Democratic proposal would never realistically pass a Republican-controlled legislature, or vice versa. But looking at actual maps that were proposed does reveal some fundamental truths about redistricting and each side’s constraints this cycle. For example, on Earth 2, where Democrats got everything they wanted, the party was still held back by the fact that they didn’t control the redistricting process in enough states. Meanwhile, on Earth 3, Republicans drew themselves some cutthroat gerrymanders — but bizarrely, it wound up resulting in more safely <i>Democratic</i> districts too. Let’s take a trip into the multiverse, shall we?</p>
<p>WHAT IF DEMOCRATS HAD PASSED THEIR BEST MAPS?MAJORITYThere are 185 Republican-leaning seats, 215 Democratic-leaning seats and 35 highly competitive seats in the most favorable maps for Democrats.</p>
<p>A blue seat for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/utah/purple_3_3/">Salt Lake City</a> and the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/wisconsin/commission_plan_b/">Milwaukee suburbs</a>? No Republican-leaning seats in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/draft_concept_3/">Maryland</a>? A <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/">second majority-Black seat</a> in both <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_c/">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb4/">Louisiana</a>? Swing seats in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arkansas/hb1962/">Arkansas</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/montana/proposal_08/">Montana</a>? The preservation of their <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorks-proposed-congressional-map-is-heavily-biased-toward-democrats-will-it-pass/">aggressive gerrymander</a> in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/amended_democratic_proposal/">New York</a>? Welcome to Democrats’ dream scenario for 2021-22 redistricting.</p>
<p>If the best proposal for Democrats had been enacted in every state, the country would have wound up with 28 more Democratic-leaning seats and 23 fewer Republican-leaning seats than the current, real map.2</p>
<p>Still, even in this best-case scenario for Democrats, that wouldn’t have been an <i>overwhelming</i> number of Democratic-leaning seats. The country’s median congressional seat still would have been highly competitive, with a partisan lean of D+4. By contrast, consider that the median congressional seat here in the real world (North Carolina’s 13th District) has a partisan lean of R+3. In other words, even in their best-case scenario, Democrats could have put themselves in an only slightly better position than Republicans find themselves in right now.</p>
<p>This reflects just how <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/">behind the eightball</a> Democrats were in the redistricting process from the very start. For example, Democrats were totally shut out of the redistricting process in Texas, so the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/draft_plan_1/">map most “favorable” to them</a> was drawn by Republicans and is heavily biased toward the GOP. Redistricting commissions, meanwhile, helped several states <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/did-redistricting-commissions-live-up-to-their-promise/">draw more <i>democratic</i> maps this cycle</a>, but prevented many of those same states from drawing more <i>Democratic</i> maps. And because these commissions disproportionately exist in states where Democrats enjoyed full control of state government, Democrats were limited from drawing maximalist gerrymanders in states like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/commission_approved/">California</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/preliminary/">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/virginia/commission_plan_b5/">Virginia</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/washington/house_democratic_caucus/">Washington</a>. Instead, these maps were all relatively fair maps drawn by commissions.</p>
<p>WHAT IF REPUBLICANS HAD PASSED THEIR BEST MAPS?MAJORITYThere are 227 Republican-leaning seats, 174 Democratic-leaning seats and 34 highly competitive seats in the most favorable maps for Republicans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, imagine a world where the state supreme courts of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/cst_2/">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/senate_gop_proposal/">Ohio</a> had let Republicans enact their most egregious gerrymanders, or where the redistricting commissions in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/first_proposal/">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/names_plan/">New York</a> had passed some of their early, Republican-favorable drafts. In this best-case scenario for the GOP, we’d be looking at 227 red seats nationwide and only 174 blue seats.</p>
<p>This is <i>so</i> much better for Republicans than the Democrats’ dream scenario is for Democrats (a map with 215 blue seats and 185 red seats). What’s more, the median congressional seat on the GOP map would have a partisan lean of R+7 — enough to put control of the House mostly out of reach for Democrats. Again, this asymmetry reflects that, between political geography and having control of more map-drawing entities, conditions were simply better for Republicans this redistricting cycle.</p>
<p>But paradoxically, there’s one way in which the Republican dream map is good for Democrats: It creates two <i>more</i> solidly blue seats3 than the Democratic dream map does (149 versus 147). That may seem counterintuitive, but it illustrates the tried-and-true gerrymandering technique of “packing” — i.e., packing as many of your opponent’s voters as possible into the smallest number of districts. For example, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/voters_of_commonwealth/">most pro-Republican map</a> of Pennsylvania created five solidly Democratic districts in order to make the other 12 winnable for Republicans.</p>
<p>The other striking thing about the Republican best-case-scenario map is how it’s only a few good Republican maps away from the national map we actually got. It has only 19 more Republican-leaning seats and 13 fewer Democratic-leaning seats than the real map, reflecting how a lot of things went right for Republicans in redistricting this year (even if it could have gone even better). For instance, the party’s best maps in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/house_passed/">Texas</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/P000C0094/">Florida</a> (two of the three states with the most congressional districts) were very close to the ones that eventually passed.</p>
<p>WHAT IF THE MOST COMPETITIVE MAPS HAD PASSED?MAJORITYThere are 186 Republican-leaning seats, 181 Democratic-leaning seats and 68 highly competitive seats in the most competitive maps.</p>
<p>Both the Democratic and Republican dream maps — and, for that matter, the maps that actually were enacted — sacrifice the number of highly competitive seats. But on Earth 4, those of us who enjoy competitive elections can truly be happy. Not only does this map boost the number of competitive seats by 28, but it also creates an almost perfectly balanced national House map — one where Republicans have a negligible five-seat advantage.</p>
<p>In contrast to the real world, where the lack of competitive districts means we should expect only narrow House majorities for the foreseeable future, this super-competitive map could produce some drastic swings in the party composition of Congress. If Democrats won every highly competitive district in this map, they’d emerge with a 249-186 House majority; if Republicans did, they’d sit at 254-181. That’s a bigger majority than either party has held in the House since the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Party-Divisions/Party-Divisions/">huge Democratic majority</a> that followed the 2008 election.</p>
<p>But those 68 highly competitive seats still wouldn’t be nearly as many as the House had as recently as the 2000 election, when there were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/">102 such districts</a>. Again, that reflects cold, hard political reality: Competitive districts are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-swing-districts-dwindle-can-a-divided-house-stand/">on the decline</a> in this country — and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ending-gerrymandering-wont-fix-what-ails-america/">not just because of gerrymandering</a>.</p>
<p>True, in states like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/georgia/dem_proposal/">Georgia</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/house_passed/">Texas</a>, the politicians who drew every proposed map this cycle had no incentive to encourage competitive seats — but even in states where nonpartisan entities like commissions and courts drew some proposals, the most pro-competition map still has a surprisingly small number of highly competitive seats. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/minnesota/wattson/">Minnesota’s</a> most competitive map had only one, for instance. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/virginia/commission_plan_c1_b/">Virginia’s</a> had only two. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/commission_draft_plan/">California’s</a> had six, but that’s only 12 percent of the state’s 52 districts.</p>
<p>Simply put, political polarization has made it harder to draw competitive seats. There are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12218">fewer swing voters</a> than there used to be, and the political realignment along <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/">urban-rural lines</a> means most parts of the country are either solidly red or solidly blue. And there is no alternative universe where that isn’t true.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This is the second entry in a </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-its-like-to-open-an-abortion-clinic-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>series</em></a><em> tracking what it’s like to open an all-trimester abortion clinic in the U.S. as abortion rights are being curtailed.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Morgan Nuzzo thinks a lot about how someone might kill her. She talked about it calmly, almost offhandedly, as she and I walked through the abortion clinic she’s opening in September with her business partner, Dr. Diane Horvath. “That’s where the steel security door will go,” Nuzzo said, pointing to an open doorway. We walked through exam rooms and offices. We talked about bulletproof glass and panic buttons. We passed a couple of ordinary-looking windows and she sighed. “I don’t know what we’re going to do about those,” she said. “We can’t put bars over them or people will feel like they’re in jail. But someone might try to come through them.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are the things abortion providers like Nuzzo think about, especially now. People who perform abortions are routinely harassed and threatened, as are clinic workers, patients and the friends and family members who take them to their appointments. According to the National Abortion Federation, an advocacy group for abortion providers, <a href="https://5aa1b2xfmfh2e2mk03kk8rsx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021_NAF_VD_Stats_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 people connected to abortion clinics have been murdered</a> in the U.S. since 1973, when abortion became legal nationwide. In addition, 26 attempted murders have been reported through 2021.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NAF began collecting data on violent or disruptive incidents at member clinics and affiliated organizations in the U.S. and Canada in 1977. Data from 2013 to 2021 also includes reports from public hospitals and public and private clinics in Mexico City and private clinics in Colombia. The &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/gunn.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first known murder of an abortion provider&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. was in 1993, and to date, all murders reported have happened in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> </p>

But anti-abortion extremism is still extensive and sometimes severe. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/recent-cases-violence-against-reproductive-health-care-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bomb threats</a>, death threats, hate mail, vandalism, arson, stalking and assault and battery — abortion clinics and the people who work there are targets for them all. As recently as 2015, a man <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/11/planned-parenthood-shooter-happy-his-attack/32579921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fatally shot three people</a> and wounded nine others at a Colorado Planned Parenthood, saying later that he was “upset with them performing abortions and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/01/28/464594826/in-wake-of-videos-planned-parenthood-investigations-find-no-fetal-tissue-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling of baby parts</a>.” Things could shift in unpredictable ways now that abortion is no longer legal everywhere. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nuzzo and Horvath could be particularly vulnerable to harassment and attacks since their clinic will offer abortions into the third trimester of pregnancy. But abortion providers everywhere are facing new risks. Anti-abortion protesters, emboldened by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recent Supreme Court decision</a> overturning the constitutional right to abortion, could travel to more abortion-friendly states like Maryland, where Nuzzo, a certified nurse-midwife, and Horvath are opening their clinic. For them, every day could bring a new, unknown threat.</p>

Set to open in September, the clinic will offer abortions into the third trimester of pregnancy, which will likely put its security at greater risk. <p>Jeremy Elvas for FiveThirtyEight</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Nuzzo and Horvath’s clinic is in a sprawling complex of offices down the street from one of the University of Maryland campuses. Their space is on the ground floor of a building set on a small hill, which means there are only a few windows facing an interior courtyard. The lack of windows “makes the interior feel a little basement-y, but overall, it’s a big plus,” Nuzzo told me. Unlike clinics in standalone buildings or on city streets, protesters won’t be able to block the entrance without a significant intrusion onto private property. Nuzzo noted with pleasure that the entry to the parking lot is across the street from a frat house. “We might ask them to keep an eye out, let us know if anything looks weird,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Outside abortion clinics, it’s common to see clusters — or sometimes crowds — of anti-abortion activists gathering as close to the clinic as they can legally stand. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/us/clinton-signs-bill-banning-blockades-and-violent-acts-at-abortion-clinics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Under a federal law passed in 1994</a>, the year after an anti-abortion extremist <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/gunn.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot and killed an abortion doctor</a> outside his Florida clinic, penalties for blockading clinics or inflicting violence on the people who work inside can be severe. The law helped reduce some of the violence by making the potential punishments more intense, according to <a href="https://law.ucdavis.edu/people/mary-ziegler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ziegler,</a> a legal historian and professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, but <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/abortion-clinic-threats-violence-safety-post-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prosecutions are still rare</a> — and anti-abortion protesters continue to take the risk. </p>

In March, another group of anti-abortion activists allegedly <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/anti-abortion-activists-invade-SF-clinic-17185369.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed their way</a> into an abortion clinic in San Francisco, chanting, “We know who you are, we know what you do,” and attempted to break into operating rooms. In May, a clinic under construction in Wyoming caught on fire in a suspected arson attack. A few weeks after the Supreme Court’s decision, six anti-abortion protesters <a href="https://www.woodtv.com/news/grand-rapids/6-anti-abortion-protesters-arrested-at-gr-reproductive-health-clinic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were arrested</a> at a clinic in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for blocking the employee door and the entry to the parking lot. And an Indiana OB-GYN who provided a medication abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio in June <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/26/1113577718/indiana-doctor-abortion-ohio-10-year-old" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been aggressively criticized</a> on right-wing media and by Indiana’s Republican attorney general, who called for an investigation of the doctor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Third-trimester abortion providers are particularly at risk, according to <a href="https://bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/carole-joffe-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carole Joffe</a>, a sociologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied threats to abortion providers. In 2009, a third-trimester abortion doctor named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/us/07tiller.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Tiller</a> was murdered at church by an anti-abortion extremist after decades of being targeted with threats and violence, including a separate shooting and the firebombing of his clinic. “He was shot in both arms before the eventual killing,” Joffe said. Tiller had been extensively vilified by conservatives and anti-abortion advocates for years. “Bill O’Reilly referred to him numerous times on Fox News as ‘Tiller the Killer,’” she said. This year, the anniversary of his death happened just about a month before the constitutional right to abortion was overturned. On that day, Horvath texted me, “It’s a reminder that there are not an insignificant number [of] people who want us dead, and who would celebrate our deaths.”</p>

After the fall of Roe v. Wade, many of them are even more uncertain about what will come next. <p>Charlie Riedel / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And confrontations seem likely to increase in the coming months. In fact, they may already be on the upswing for everyone involved in the abortion debate. Crisis pregnancy centers, which try to persuade women not to have abortions, have also been <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/hialeah/article263217043.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vandalized</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/07/01/nashville-molotov-cocktail-abortion-tennessee/7788434001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened</a> recently. And even though the legal landscape is friendlier to anti-abortion advocates than it has been in almost 50 years, some are still frustrated that legal abortion will continue in many states. On its Facebook page, an anti-abortion group called Red Rose Rescue <a href="https://www.facebook.com/red.rose.rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked to an article about the Grand Rapids arrests</a>, saying that the “rescue movement seems to be coming back to life, especially after the recent Dobbs decision overturned Roe.” Red Rose Rescue is part of a specific brand of intervention: Activists enter clinic waiting rooms in a group and hand out materials about alternatives to abortion to women waiting for their appointments (and in the case of Red Rose Rescue, roses), <a href="https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/lauren-handy-jailed-as-pro-life-rescue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often refusing to leave</a> until they’re arrested. </p>

		</aside><p data-paragraph="main">Anti-abortion protesters see these acts as a desperate attempt to help women understand the gravity of the decision they’re making, and to give them an opportunity to change their minds. But to the people who work at clinics — and to the patients themselves, who <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(12)00815-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually don’t have any doubts</a> about the procedure by the time they get to their appointments — the blockades and incursions are disruptive and frightening. Part of the problem, Ziegler said, is that it’s never clear when a confrontation will become violent. Some of the people who ultimately murdered abortion providers <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-11-mn-1021-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started as protesters</a> standing peacefully outside clinics. “You just don’t know who is dangerous, or will become dangerous,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The police are, in theory, a resource that abortion providers can tap. But Roxanne Sutocky, the director of community engagement at The Women’s Centers, a group of abortion clinics along the East Coast, said that calling the police can be complicated. For one thing, patients who have had negative experiences with the police may not find their presence especially calming. And Sutocky said that the response can vary a lot depending on the culture of the local police department: “We don’t always get the response [from the police] that’s appropriate to the level of harassment or violence we’re facing.” </p>

It’s not hard, for instance, to figure out where an abortion provider lives, particularly if they own their home. “We’ve had staff followed home from facilities,” said Sutocky. Once, she said, she got a piece of hate mail addressed to her at the clinic, with her home address in the return address spot on the envelope. “The message was pretty clear, and it really did scare me,” she said. “It’s hard not to be afraid for your family.” It’s not uncommon for anti-abortion activists to find abortion providers’ homes and <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/dc-neighbors-receive-abortion-doctor-flyers/65-6deb2cb9-0ba9-4c50-a4f1-bc34ebec26be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plaster their neighborhood</a> with threatening flyers. And things can escalate far beyond threats. In 1998, Dr. Barnett Slepian, an abortion provider in upstate New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/nyregion/abortion-doctor-in-buffalo-slain-sniper-attack-fits-violent-pattern.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned from synagogue on a Friday evening</a> and <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/20-years-later-barnett-slepians-murder-still-haunts/article_80f9b995-56ef-5ea8-a338-176bb88e909c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was heating split-pea soup in the microwave</a> when he was shot through the kitchen window by an anti-abortion extremist. He died within two hours.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After they decided to open their clinic, one of the first things Nuzzo and Horvath did was to hire Brightlines, an anti-doxing service for people whose security is at risk, to scrub the internet of as much of their personal information as possible. Shauna Dillavou, the company’s founder and CEO, told me that it’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/anti-abortion-protesters-target-clinics-landlord-outside-childs-md-school/2011/09/12/gIQAn8z2NK_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not just easy</a> for anti-abortion activists to find home addresses. “You can also find out where a doctor’s kid goes to school, where their partner works,” she said. That information can be weaponized too: Dillavou said that one of her clients was falsely reported to Child Protective Services for abusing or neglecting their children. Simply knowing that an abortion provider has children is a risk that has <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2022/07/17/dr-caitlin-bernard-daughter-kidnapping-threat-in-2020/65375223007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led to kidnapping threats</a>. “Or a partner can be threatened at their job,” Dillavou said. “Like, ‘Did you know your wife is a “baby killer”?’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nuzzo, for her part, seems largely resigned to a life of constant unease. As we stood in the waiting room of the clinic, inspecting the new ice machine that had just arrived, a man knocked on the door. Nuzzo immediately straightened, her whole body on guard. “Hello, sir,” she said loudly through the door, tension radiating through her voice. “How can I help you?”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">He turned out to be a sales representative for a medical device company. Nuzzo sent him on his way and turned back to me. “Every strange man knocking at the door is just a new adventure,” she said. I asked her if she’d feel safer once the clinic was open and full of people, with all the new security measures in place. “Honestly?” she said. “I don’t think I’ll ever feel safe again.”</p>]]></description>
