<p data-paragraph="main">Who gets blamed when gas prices go up? And what are the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-americans-may-or-may-not-blame-biden-for-higher-gas-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political consequences</a>? Last week, President Biden announced that the U.S. would ban imports of Russian oil and warned that it would mean higher prices at the pump. That comes after a year of rising prices already. The average cost in the U.S. today is $4.33 per gallon. A year ago, it was $2.86, <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to AAA</a>. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses what high gas prices have meant for politics historically and outlines the debates in Washington over how to bring those prices down.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The crew also explores some of the ways <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbUbaroCZgs&amp;t=20s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American life has changed</a> in the two-plus years since the U.S. started introducing measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When President Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-ban-russian-oil-imports-energy-products/story?id=83315763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced last week</a> that he was banning Russian oil imports to the United States to retaliate against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he conceded that Americans would pay more for gas as a result. “Defending freedom is going to cost,” Biden said. “It’s going to cost us as well.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But higher prices at the pump and elsewhere aren’t new. For nearly a year now, Americans have faced sharply rising inflation, and the latest numbers were further confirmation of that reality: U.S. prices last month rose 7.9 percent year-over-year, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/economy/us-consumer-price-inflation-february/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest such increase since 1982</a> and a continuation of a worrying trajectory as the country recovers from the pandemic recession and a beaten-down supply chain.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that this trajectory worsens, too, as the global economic outlook has gotten a lot more uncertain following Russia’s invasion late last month. Prices for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-asia-tokyo-sydney-1ac7c193d204266b2901fe420d32c2c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oil</a>, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wheat-continues-surge-toward-all-time-high-as-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-shuts-down-exports-11646664524" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wheat</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/carmakers-face-higher-costs-and-supply-issues-as-price-of-nickel-soars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other resources</a> have skyrocketed as countries around the world impose harsh sanctions against Russian industries, and U.S. gas prices have ticked all the way up to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/energy/record-gas-price/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.17 per gallon</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a precarious situation for Biden because inflation and, in particular, higher gas prices — including those spurred by overseas oil crises — have been shown to drag down presidential approval. At the same time, presidents haven’t always experienced lower approval as a result of these conflicts, so it’s possible that, given the situation in Ukraine, Americans won’t blame Biden for higher gas prices as they have blamed past presidents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Higher gas prices are hardly the only result of inflation, but they are one of the most visible and visceral realities of inflation for Americans. Scholarship has found that consumer sentiment gets <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3267721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly more pessimistic</a> in response to rising gas prices, and that Americans form higher inflation expectations and change their spending habits <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26237/w26237.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when they see higher gas prices</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Higher gas prices have also been shown to drag down presidential approval. As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote back in December</a>, overall inflation has been associated with several periods of downturn in presidential approval, and research has also found that higher gas prices typically have a <a href="https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Presidential-Approval-and-Gas-Prices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant and negative effect on presidents’ approval ratings</a>. But it’s not as simple as higher gas prices meaning lower presidential approval, according to <a href="https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/people/jon-krosnick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Krosnick</a>, a social psychologist at Stanford University who has researched the link between presidential approval and economic indicators. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Namely, situations like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine can play a role in whether Americans blame Biden — or something or someone else, like Russia and Vladimir Putin — for inflation, according to Krosnick. And in this particular situation, it’s possible many Americans will tolerate higher gas prices as a result of sanctions against Russia, according to recent surveys from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/omtmdczu48/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a> and <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The impact of economic indicators on presidential approval depends upon the attribution that the public makes for the cause of economic indicators getting better or worse,” said Krosnick. “In other words, what matters here is whether the president can reasonably be held responsible for what happened to gas prices, or anything else [can].”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, higher gas prices resulting from foreign oil shocks haven’t always worsened presidential approval ratings. Take, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/16/business/economic-scene-the-broad-impact-of-the-gulf-war.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1990 oil shock</a>, which was caused by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 of that year. Even as the price of oil spiked, former president George H.W. Bush’s approval jumped over 16 percentage points in less than a month as the international community swiftly condemned Iraq’s actions, and it rose again after the U.S.-led intervention in early 1991. Moreover, the price of oil <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111114053633/http://www.brookings.edu/economics/bpea/~/media/Files/Programs/ES/BPEA/2009_spring_bpea_papers/2009_spring_bpea_hamilton.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to roughly prior levels</a> in less than a year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unlikely that Biden will see this kind of upswell in his presidential approval rating, but it is true that we haven’t yet seen a drop in his presidential approval to accompany the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-sams-club-lines-as-gas-fuel-prices-soar-2022-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long lines at the pump</a> — in fact, we’ve seen the opposite. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval today</a> is about the same as it was at the start of the Ukraine crisis and has actually rebounded since the initial days of the invasion, a period of time over which prices have risen considerably. He could be seeing <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/08/biden-approval-rating-ukraine-00015065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bump</a> from his State of the Union address and from the Ukraine crisis itself, and as Krosnick noted, U.S. presidential approval often responds positively to international conflicts — even if big swings in approval are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-approval-rating-isnt-bouncing-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly a thing of the past</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One other factor working in Biden’s favor is that the U.S. is far less dependent on foreign oil than it was during the 1973 and 1979 energy crises. “At the time, if OPEC countries decided that they wanted to reduce production, that was it,” said <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/carroll-school/faculty-research/faculty-directory/francesco-dacunto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francesco D’Acunto</a>, a professor of finance at Boston College. “Even if we see that prices are increasing [right now], we haven’t yet observed anything close to what was happening in the late ’70s,” he added. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Biden is still walking a tightrope on inflation. Inflation was high even before a foreign conflict pumped more uncertainty into the U.S. economy, and most Americans disapproved of Biden’s handling <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fMLXPDp_XAlU4X-vC3Q5qSRcle8g245Q/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of inflation prior to the Ukraine crisis</a>. Moreover, as with much polling on foreign policy, voters <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00602.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often take their cues from elites</a> on which policies to support, and it’s quite possible that they’ll end up <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-care-about-the-invasion-of-ukraine-but-that-doesnt-mean-they-will-rally-around-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflecting partisan loyalties</a> when evaluating how Biden has handled what’s happening in Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of that could lead Americans to rate the economy more poorly and, thus, hurt Biden’s political prospects. But it is still far too early to tell whether the conflict’s potentially negative effects on the U.S. economy will be just another economic issue Americans blame him for — or one that they’re willing to tolerate.</p>]]></description>

			<title>How An Uptick In Censures Among Local Republicans Signals A Growing Radicalism</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The Republican National Committee’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-censures-cheney-kinzinger-moves-pull-debates-82678331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censure last month of GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger</a> was a historical rarity — national parties almost never reprimand their own officeholders. But in many ways it was the culmination of what’s been happening at the state level. State and local parties are increasingly disciplining their officeholders, and it’s mostly happening on the Republican side.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s typical for the losing party in a presidential race to undergo some sort of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Loss-Democrats-Seth-Masket/dp/1108482120/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2WHSGBSS8GIZI&amp;keywords=Masket&amp;qid=1641421903&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=maske%2Cstripbooks%2C208&amp;sr=1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">period of self-reflection after its loss</a>, trying to come up with a narrative that will help guide it in future elections. But what Republicans have gone through since 2020 is something of a departure, with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/07/republicans-big-lie-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many in the party</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/05/1070362852/trump-big-lie-election-jan-6-families" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguing</a> that former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/perdue-kemp-ga-governor-trump-big-lie/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t actually lose</a>. Moreover, these election deniers haven’t just tried to delegitimize the 2020 election results, they’ve also spearheaded an effort to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/heeding-steve-bannons-call-election-deniers-organize-to-seize-control-of-the-gop-and-reshape-americas-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebuke Republicans who have said Trump lost</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the key tools these Trump supporters have used is the censure. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-is-censure-congress-/2021/11/18/20245326-4889-11ec-b8d9-232f4afe4d9b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A censure</a> is something governing bodies (often legislatures) use to issue official statements of condemnation or disapproval. Censures have a long history in this country. The U.S. Senate, for example, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/parties-leadership/censure-president-jackson.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured President Andrew Jackson in 1834</a> for effectively shuttering the Bank of the United States. The Senate has also <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/censure.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured nine of its own members</a>, and in 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Discipline/Expulsion-Censure-Reprimand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured its 24th member</a>, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, for, among other things, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-house-gosar-ocasio-cortez/2021/11/17/4e012bb4-47b9-11ec-b8d9-232f4afe4d9b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting an anime video of himself killing a fellow member</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the censure is, by definition, a symbolic act: It does not actually remove anyone from office or strip anyone of power. In fact, the censure has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-does-it-mean-to-censure-a-politician" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically carried little weight</a>, although it can signal to the officeholder that they are losing standing with their party and that their renomination is likely in jeopardy. And until recently, censures were also relatively rare.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">State parties <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-trumpiest-republicans-are-at-the-state-and-local-levels-not-in-d-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have issued a number of censures</a> since the beginning of 2021. Take Arizona, a state that has made headlines for its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/post-election-audits-are-normal-whats-happening-in-arizona-is-anything-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frivolous investigations into the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election</a>. In early 2021, Republicans in the state <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/23/politics/arizona-gop-censure-mccain-flake-ducey/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured three Republicans</a> for, among other things, failing to support Trump: former Sen. Jeff Flake, Gov. Doug Ducey and Cindy McCain, the widow of the late Sen. John McCain. Democrats in the state haven’t been as quick to censure as Republicans, but in January 2022, the Arizona Democratic Party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/us/politics/sinema-censure-arizona-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured Sen. Kyrsten Sinema</a> for her refusal to change filibuster rules in order to pass voting rights measures. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just state parties, either. Censures aren’t as well documented at the county level, as  there are more than 3,000 counties in the U.S. versus just 50 states, but I found in a search of nearly 7,000 newspapers using <a href="https://www.newsbank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NewsBank</a>, a news research database, an explosion of censures, especially in 2021, at the county level.</p>



<figure><img width="1150" height="1210" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/masket.CENSURES.0309-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/masket.CENSURES.0309-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/masket.CENSURES.0309-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/masket.CENSURES.0309-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The pattern is pretty striking. Censures by county parties were until recently a rare event, affecting somewhere between zero and three people per year, I found. Most were issued over relatively modest local or factional party disputes. Republicans in Bexar County, Texas, for example, <a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Straus-censured-by-Bexar-County-GOP-12425417.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured then-state House Speaker Joe Straus</a> for blocking a number of conservative bills in 2017. In Mohave County, Arizona Republicans <a href="https://www.havasunews.com/news/paul-mosley-censured-by-county-gop/article_0a05e526-87f0-11e8-993f-f3735fa604c0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured state Rep. Paul Mosley</a> in 2018 for “conduct unbecoming” after he tried to abuse his position as a state legislator in order to get out of a traffic ticket. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But starting in 2020, the types of censures county parties issued shifted — both censures issued in 2020, for instance, had to do with COVID-19 mask mandates. In 2021, I found, there was just a dramatic increase in county-level censures, especially among Republican county parties. Republican county parties censured 23 GOP officeholders in 2021 compared to Democrats’ five, and what’s more, most Republican censures were tied in some way to the 2020 election, the subsequent Jan. 6 insurrection or the ensuing fallout.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, I have organized the county censure data by the number of individuals censured, which can be tricky. There are only five Democratic censures here, for example, and four of them were actually done in the same resolution, passed by the Democratic Party of Palm Beach County, Florida, to &lt;a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/education/2021/06/04/pbc-dems-censure-school-board-members-over-white-advantage-reversal/7541548002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;chastise four school board members&lt;/a&gt; for removing the phrase “white advantage” from a statement about equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a>Although censures are still relatively rare events — I found just 34 of them in more than 3,000 counties over the past seven years — the uptick in the last year signals a growing form of radicalism among local party committees. All of this points to yet another signal of a Republican Party undergoing a purge. Parties often wage ideological fights in their primary contests, but primaries take time. In this rash of recent censures, we’re seeing county party leaders trying to more emphatically assert which faction of the party is in charge, and as I’ve documented above, that could dramatically reshape the GOP at its most fundamental levels of government</p>]]></description>

			<title>How The War In Ukraine Might Change Putin’s Popularity Among Russians</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to fathom what’s happening in Ukraine right now. Schools <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/video/20220306-war-in-ukraine-school-bombed-by-russian-army" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being bombed</a>. Civilians <a href="https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/from-molotov-cocktails-to-anti-tank-barr-idUSRTS62SIY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forming militias and making</a> molotov cocktails. Millions of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60555472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people displaced</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/04/ukraine-russia-casualties-kyiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unknown number</a> of deaths. But perhaps equally difficult to fathom is the fact that, as recently as last month, the man behind this war, Russian president Vladimir Putin, was enjoying his highest approval ratings in nearly four years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In February, Putin <a href="https://www.levada.ru/en/ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a 71 percent approval</a> rating and a 27 percent disapproval rating among the Russian public, the highest it’s been since May 2018 (though it’s never dipped below 59 percent according to the Levada-Center). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, it’s natural to question the accuracy of public opinion polling under an authoritarian regime, but there are actually a number of reasons to believe those approval ratings represent genuine Russian sentiment. For one, the polling comes from the Levada-Center, a respected, independent pollster. And if you’re suspicious that Russians aren’t being totally honest about their feelings with pollsters due to fear of retribution, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1060586X.2016.1144334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research to control for this phenomenon</a> has found this isn’t the case — the polls are capturing true Russian opinions on Putin. Sure, there is likely some bias, but the bottom line is that Putin’s popularity at home is real. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other recent polling suggests that many Russians view the war in Ukraine differently from those in the West. A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/08/russia-public-opinion-ukraine-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted in Russia last week</a> by a group of independent survey research organizations (who have remained anonymous in order to avoid backlash from the Kremlin), found that about 58 percent of Russians approve of the invasion of Ukraine, while 23 percent oppose it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason Russians still support Putin and the war in Ukraine has to do with the propaganda and disinformation being sown by the Kremlin. Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/world/europe/russia-censorship-media-crackdown.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin banned the spreading</a> of “false information” about the war — including calling it a war. He also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-business-europe-germany-d15ca4ed450d9ca67f43d3b1ac27294d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked Facebook and Twitter</a>, as well as a number of Western news outlets including the BBC, making it even harder for Russians to get outside information. And among state-sponsored media in Russia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/world/europe/russia-ukraine-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the war is downplayed and cast</a> as a peacekeeping mission designed to liberate Ukraine from Nazis and drug-addled dictators.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, it’s not surprising that the Russian public has a very different view of the war: When asked <a href="https://www.levada.ru/en/2022/03/04/ukraine-and-donbass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a poll by the Levada-Center</a> in late February who they thought was the initiator of the escalations in Ukraine, 60 percent of Russians said the U.S. and NATO members were to blame — just 3 percent said Russia was the initiator. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there are some realities of the war that can’t be ignored or downplayed, and they impact Russians’ views, too. For instance, as international sanctions place increased pressure on Russia’s financial sector, the ruble, Russia’s official currency, has plummeted, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russians-line-up-at-banks-as-currency-plummets-in-face-of-sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russians have been lining up at banks</a> trying to withdraw cash. As a result, consumer confidence in Russia has taken a hit, dipping to its lowest point this year. On March 2 it dropped to 98.4, a 5.6 percent drop from four days prior, according to Morning Consult’s Russia Index <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/03/russian-consumers-are-feeling-the-impact-of-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of Consumer Sentiment</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also clear from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/06/protest-arrests-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the public protests by Russians against the war</a>, which have resulted in thousands of arrests, that many are not buying the official Kremlin line. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/mar/02/ukrainians-are-our-friends-the-young-russian-anti-war-protesters-defying-putin-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many of those protestors</a> are young Russians, among whom support for the war was lower in the anonymous poll released last week: Among 18- to 24-year-olds, 29 percent supported the war, and 39 percent opposed it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the war rages on, Putin’s popularity may become more precarious, too, if history is any indication. Russians have tended to <a href="https://theconversation.com/putins-public-approval-is-soaring-during-the-russia-ukraine-crisis-but-its-unlikely-to-last-177302" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose faith in Putin</a> when faced with ongoing war, economic uncertainty or public protest against the leader.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“While examining hundreds of thousands of Russian public opinion survey responses from 2003-19, I have found that merely being exposed to public protest depresses approval of Putin and his regime,” Noah Buckley, a political science professor at Trinity College Dublin, wrote in <a href="https://theconversation.com/putins-approval-has-stayed-strong-over-the-years-war-in-ukraine-could-change-that-178179" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent op-ed</a> for The Conversation. “Members of the general public learn about regime misdeeds from these protests, and discover that there are more dissenters in their society than they may have previously assumed. In other ongoing research, my co-authors and I have found that when Russians find out that Putin’s approval levels are not as sky-high as they thought, their own feelings towards him sour substantially.”</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>On Tuesday, President Biden announced <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-ban-russian-oil-imports-energy-products/story?id=83315763">a ban on Russian oil and energy imports</a>, and it turns out that many Americans support this decision, even if this results in higher gas prices. When asked directly if they would support imposing sanctions on Russian oil even if it led to higher fuel prices, <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3838">71 percent</a> of Americans (from a Mar. 4-6 Quinnipiac University poll) and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-08/card/wsj-poll-79-of-americans-back-ban-on-russian-oil-even-if-energy-prices-rise-niT9f6YRH5wRWe4pbhNv">79 percent</a> (from a Mar. 4-7 Wall Street Journal/Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates/ALG Research poll) said yes. When some pollsters included the option to support sanctions but<em> not</em> if they increased oil prices, support for sanctions was less consistently high. Sixty-nine percent of Americans supported sanctions even if they increased U.S. energy prices, and 12 percent supported sanctions as long as they <em>didn’t</em> increase prices, according to <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202203010901.pdf">a Mar. 1-2 poll</a> from Marist College/NPR/PBS NewsHour. However, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/nnyqh3ib1d/econToplines.pdf">a Mar. 5-8 The Economist/YouGov poll</a> of Americans found much lower support (46 percent supported sanctions regardless of their effect on U.S. gas prices, but 27 percent supported sanctions only if they didn’t raise prices) as did a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/07/russian-oil-embargo-polling-ukraine-crisis/">Mar. 5-7 Morning Consult poll</a> of registered voters (49 percent supported sanctions regardless of their effect on U.S. gas prices, but 28 percent supported sanctions only if they didn’t raise prices).</li><li>A plurality of Americans (42 percent) felt that <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/omtmdczu48/econToplines.pdf">parents should have the final say</a> over whether K-12 students are required to wear masks in school, according to a Feb. 26-Mar. 1 poll from The Economist/YouGov.

<p data-paragraph="main">As the war in Ukraine enters its third week, the threat of a nuclear conflict hangs in the balance. NATO has said it will not send troops to Ukraine or, despite repeated calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, enforce a no-fly zone over the country. Doing so, NATO says, risks escalating the situation to a direct conflict between nuclear powers. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are divided on most issues these days. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine might be an exception — sort of. In recent polling, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/03/03/the-invasion-of-ukraine-unites-a-divided-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both Democrats and Republicans</a> say they support Ukraine over Russia, approve of economic sanctions against Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, and agree that the U.S. should send money and weapons — but not troops — to Ukraine. Calls for sanctions have received <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/04/ukraine-congress-bipartisan-trump-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan support</a> in Congress as well. Yet <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-stefanik-biden-weakness-world-less-safe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prominent Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/02/24/media-fox-biden-blame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative media figures</a> have criticized President Biden’s handling of the situation, and some, like former President Donald Trump, have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/25/tucker-carlson-fox-news-russia-putin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone as far</a> as to <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article258638383.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praise Putin</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, many Americans have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/us/politics/congress-ukraine-russia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed nostalgia</a> for a time when politics stopped at the water’s edge, a phrase attributed to Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, who urged his Republican colleagues to work with President Harry Truman, a Democrat, on postwar national-security issues despite their differences on domestic policies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But was there ever a time when our country wasn’t divided, even on questions of foreign policy? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conflicts that we now think of as uniting the country were still political. Americans were torn over what to do in World War II, for example. Congress <a href="https://millercenter.org/president/fdroosevelt/foreign-affairs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a series of neutrality acts</a> in the 1930s, and these isolationist policies were responsible for America’s late entry into the war. And, of course, unity sometimes came at a price. The U.S. government’s <a href="https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steps to punish anti-war speech during World War I</a>, for instance, are good examples of going too far with the idea that dissent is inherently harmful to war efforts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is that foreign policy has always been contested — and, more often than not, linked to questions of <a href="https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/japanese-relocation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identity</a> and <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/age-of-eisenhower/mcarthyism-red-scare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideology</a>. But debates about war are so interwoven with our larger culture-war politics now that most questions of how to handle military conflict have been largely reduced to partisan scoring. And that’s a problem — not because we need to get back to some bygone bipartisan era, but because real dissension is vital in a democracy, especially in matters of foreign policy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The seeds of war politics’ merging with culture-war politics arguably date back to the late 1960s, when anti-Vietnam War protests overlapped with civil rights protests and other social movements that challenged the existing social order. Over time, conservatives and liberals <a href="http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/Zaller%201991%20APSR%20Information%20Values%20Opinion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diverged in their attitudes</a> toward the war, especially as liberal elites began to criticize it. Starting with the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/1968-election-won-by-nixon-still-haunts-our-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1968 presidential election</a>, being anti-war became more closely associated with being a liberal Democrat. And the accusation that George McGovern, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/108977/acid-amnesty-and-abortion-unlikely-source-legendary-smear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee,</a> was all for “<a href="https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1650-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acid, amnesty</a><a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amnesty for ‘draft dodgers.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1650-3.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1650-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and abortion</a>” helped solidify this cultural connection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this larger cultural split between the two parties came to a head during the Iraq War. In many ways, it’s connected to the political discourse we’re seeing with Russia and Ukraine now. Unlike now, though, the discourse during the Iraq War — in the beginning at least — exemplified the idea that politics stops at the water’s edge. Critics of then-President George W. Bush rallied behind him after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and public opinion on the war was <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/19/iraq-war-continues-to-divide-u-s-public-15-years-after-it-began/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially quite favorable</a>, even though <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2002/s237" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats</a> were far more<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/107/hjres114" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> split than <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/107/hjres114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That national unity turned out to be short-lived, though. As <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/195620/summary?casa_token=O_d704mGPBsAAAAA:UckFyFpiFQlwqyFbPW22bqyHw-tKcsXLwooH45fIJIl1EtkJSqNc4E1bvNjpSQDXSXc4jLhqrA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political communications scholar Mary Stuckey</a> has observed, it was during the Iraq War that the two parties began to make very distinct arguments about what it meant to be an American in relation to the war. Bush, for instance, often framed the war on terror, including the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/timeline/iraq-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. invasion of Iraq</a>, in terms of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42940574.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good and evil</a> as he tried to establish the GOP as the party of faith and strength. Democrats, meanwhile, in their 2004 party platform accused Bush and the Republicans of having an “<a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2004-democratic-party-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insufficient understanding of our enemy</a>” and a failure to comprehend the complexity of the situation in the Middle East.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Iraq War was not directly related to Bush’s religious faith, both supporters and opponents alike depicted his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna6371594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approach to war</a> as reflective of his <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2004-08-29-0408290144-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall philosophical approach</a>: The president relied on gut and instinct, not expertise, to make decisions. Likewise, Bush’s 2004 presidential campaign portrayed his Democratic opponent, then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QpS2Am51Wo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waffling intellectual</a> who lacked conviction and patriotic dedication. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, the debate over the Iraq War quickly became an extension of the debates Democrats and Republicans were already having in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/22/us/2000-campaign-matters-faith-bush-uses-religion-personal-political-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2000 presidential election</a> — and <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/dukakis-and-the-tank-099119/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even earlier</a> — about religion, culture and Bush’s intellect and qualifications.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, the Bush administration’s justification for the Iraq War became the subject of widespread criticism across the ideological spectrum since the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/22/iraq-war-wmds-an-intelligence-failure-or-white-house-spin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rationale for invasion</a> was shaky at best. But the narratives Democrats and Republicans employed during the invasion of Iraq and the war on terror were still powerful for the ways in which they preyed on domestic and cultural disagreements and anxieties.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These arguments also had important implications for debates over presidential war powers. While many Republicans embraced an expansive role for the president — a strong leader asserting U.S. dominance on the world stage — Democrats said in their 2008 presidential platform that they “<a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2008-democratic-party-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reject[ed] the sweeping claims of ‘inherent’ presidential power</a>,” and that their candidate, then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, would better grasp intercultural nuance and policy detail. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as president, Obama struggled with questions of war and war powers as well. Although his administration was committed to a less interventionist approach, world events still demanded attention. There were new questions to answer about American intervention in the Middle East and North Africa, as civil wars broke out in <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/03/24/obamas-unconstitutional-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Libya</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/02/what-policy-lessons-are-there-from-the-war-in-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syria</a>. And like Bush, Obama often found himself the subject of criticism — first for <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/what-exactly-is-the-war-powers-act-and-is-obama-really-violating-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going too far in Libya</a> and then for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-obama-analysis/syrias-civil-war-to-mar-obama-legacy-idUSKBN14228S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not going far enough in Syria</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, the debate around the Iraq War didn’t help either Democrats or Republicans create a coherent set of ideas about how to engage with foreign conflict, how to prepare for the aftermath of one, or when it makes the most sense to avoid getting involved at all. Obama was different from Bush, but the foreign-policy questions he faced were still difficult — and domestic culture-war disputes were not especially useful in resolving them. Yet, because of the Iraq War, the country was now set on a political course that undermined the goal of meaningful, reasoned dissent on foreign policy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Figuring out the role the U.S. should play following the Russian invasion of Ukraine requires answering a completely different set of questions than the global war on terror or the U.S. response to the war in Syria required, but as we saw in Vietnam, Iraq and elsewhere, culture-war politics are once again overshadowing the discussion of what to do. Instead of debating the extent to which Americans should intervene in Ukraine, Republicans have attacked Biden as a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-target-biden-blame-over-putins-ukraine-invasion-2022-02-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weak leader</a> — and that’s the PG-rated stuff: Many attacks from the far right have veered into even <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/31/1077064951/global-culture-wars-some-far-right-groups-in-the-u-s-are-taking-a-pro-russia-sta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uglier culture-war territory</a> and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/former-trump-adviser-steve-bannon-backs-anti-woke-vladimir-putin-1682122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praise for the Russian president</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, most rank-and-file Republicans have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-is-still-largely-skeptical-of-putin-for-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unfavorable views of the Russian invasion</a>, not sympathy toward Putin. (Instead, a partisan divide is emerging over whether the U.S. should be “<a href="https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us02282022_umex87.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing more</a>.”) Still, it’s not hard to figure out why the discussion of whether and how America gets involved in armed conflict has devolved into partisan point-scoring. Nearly everything has. But this has a real cost, and the answer isn’t for politics to stop at the water’s edge. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Dissenting viewpoints and serious debate are crucial in a democracy, and foreign policy is not an exception. Politics can and should be a place for real debate and multiple viewpoints. It is imperative to hold public officials accountable for their decisions. When we treat foreign policy as an extension of domestic cultural politics, we lose almost as much as we do when we act as though it’s not up for debate at all.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The Democratic presidential primary might feel like a lifetime ago, but one <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21005124/2020-presidential-candidates-health-care-democratic-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">important storyline in that race</a> was health care — specifically single-payer health care, or the policy that the government should offer universal health insurance to everyone in the country. The nomination of now-President Biden, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/coronavirus-crisis-hasn-t-changed-joe-biden-s-mind-medicare-n1172361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who opposed single-payer health care during the primary</a>, has put single-payer health care on the backburner nationally. But that hasn’t stopped the issue from impacting state legislators, who have introduced more single-payer health care bills in the last few years than ever before. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Health care policy researchers Erin C. Fuse Brown and Elizabeth McCuskey <a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9687&amp;context=penn_law_review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracked the number of unique single-payer bills</a> introduced in state legislatures across the country from 2010 to 2019, finding a sharp uptick in bills introduced since 2017. During each of those three years, at least 10 single-payer proposals were introduced, according to Brown and McCuskey’s research, for the first time since 2013. In total, state legislators proposed more single-payer bills from 2017 to 2019 than in the previous seven years combined. And for 2021, we’ve identified 10 single-payer bills that legislators introduced across the country, from liberal states like <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/S766/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massachusetts</a> to more conservative ones including <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=89&amp;ba=HF55" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa</a> and <a href="https://www.ohiosenate.gov/legislation/GA134-SB-253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a>.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, it’s possible this tally includes repeats of past years’ bills or bills that are not truly single-payer — Fuse Brown and McCuskey touch on some of the challenges of tracking this in their methodology — but the number of bills introduced last year shows that single-payer is still a popular legislative issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What do all these proposals have in common? They’ve all universally failed. In fact, Vermont, the only state that managed to pass single-payer health care in 2011, ended up <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/why-vermonts-single-payer-effort-failed-and-what-democrats-can-learn-from-it/2019/04/29/c9789018-3ab8-11e9-a2cd-307b06d0257b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shelving its plan three years later</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It makes sense why single-payer advocates have tried to take these fights to the states. States have traditionally been seen as the “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5594285/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laboratories of democracy</a>,” and some advocates of single-payer health care have argued that liberal states <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/10/state-federal-medicare-for-all-single-payer-health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could provide unique opportunities</a> to advance single-payer health care. But as I’ll explain, passing single-payer health care at the state level is next to impossible, as states are particularly limited in how they can allocate federal and private health care funds. There is, however, evidence that Americans may have an appetite for a public option, or government-run health insurance that people can opt into at the state level. <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/07/22/3-states-pursue-public-option-for-health-coverage-as-feds-balk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three states</a> (Colorado, Nevada and Washington) have already passed a public option. It’s not single-payer health care reform, but it’s possible that we might see more states adopt their own public-option reforms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One big reason single-payer proposals haven’t caught on at the state level is because finding a reliable way to pay for such a program is challenging. Single-payer advocates originally envisioned a federal proposal that would cover all Americans under <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/what-medicare-all-how-would-it-work-n1014256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a more generous version</a> of a preexisting program — that is, Medicare, but now for all. Doing this state-by-state would require each state <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20190717.466249/full/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to apply for waivers</a> to divert federal funds used for Medicare, Medicaid and Affordable Care Act exchanges to be used for their own single-payer plans. And that’s tricky because the Department of Health and Human Services has wide discretion to approve or deny states’ requests, which makes any proposal highly dependent on the national political climate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t just a theoretical debate either: Trump’s administrator for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Seema Verma said in 2018 that she would <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180725/NEWS/180729942/verma-will-reject-any-single-payer-state-waivers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deny waivers from states to create single-payer systems</a>, while Biden’s Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/fact-check-xavier-becerra-opposition-ads-single-payer-insurance-health-care-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has expressed more favorable sentiments</a>. Almost all single-payer proposals depend on these waivers and states don’t often have fallback plans for if this federal funding gets denied.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Employer-sponsored health insurance plans, which <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-274.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cover 54 percent of Americans</a>, are another hurdle for states trying to pass single-payer health care. Federal law <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20190717.466249/full/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely prevents states from regulating</a> employer-provided health insurance, so states can’t just stop employers from offering their own health care benefits. The exact scope of this law has been <a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9687&amp;context=penn_law_review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">litigated for decades</a>, but suffice it to say that it’s successfully put the kibosh on many statewide health care reforms. Single-payer health insurance is particularly tricky as there’s no way to get everyone onto the plan without first changing how private insurance works. States have tried to address this through measures like increasing payroll taxes or restricting providers’ ability to accept reimbursement from private insurance plans. But the more elaborate these mechanisms get, the more complicated it becomes to implement — and the more people that could slip through the cracks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, another big financial barrier is that state governments <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-state-balanced-budget-requirements-and-how-do-they-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have far less leeway than the federal government</a> to increase budgetary spending. That means tax increases, which come with their own political challenges, are often necessary for states to secure the funding they need.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take California’s single-payer proposal, <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/2022/02/california-single-payer-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which failed in</a> late January. It would have required two-thirds of voters to pass <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220ACA11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate constitutional amendment</a> to implement the necessary tax increases to pay for it. Concerns over tax increases also contributed to the demise of single-payer proposals <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/14/16296132/colorado-single-payer-ballot-initiative-failure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Colorado</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/12/22/7427117/single-payer-vermont-shumlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont</a>. It’s true that a recent analysis of New York’s single-payer health care plan found that it would lower overall health care spending <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2424.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 3 percent</a> by 2031, but it would also require additional state tax revenue of $139 billion in 2022 — over 150 percent of the current state budget. Politicians facing the next election cycle may be leery of proposing short-term tax increases, even if the end result is long-term savings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this creates a daunting picture for statewide single-payer health care. But the failures of single-payer doesn’t entirely close the door on health care reform, especially if these reforms are supplementing the existing system instead of entirely replacing it. Colorado and Nevada, for instance, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22535267/public-option-health-insurance-nevada-colorado-washington" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successfully passed a public option</a> in 2021, joining Washington, which passed one in 2019. Colorado’s success in advancing a public option is particularly striking, given that almost 80 percent of people <a href="https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2016/11/08/coloradocare-amendment-69/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted against</a> its single-payer proposal in 2016.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, though, efforts to implement a public option aren’t without their own challenges. In 2021, during its first year of implementation, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/22/health-202-states-are-eyeing-public-option-health-plans-many-obstacles-stand-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington state’s public option struggled</a> to enroll people and get health care providers to agree to lower payment rates. State lawmakers have tried to fix this problem by introducing legislation that would require more providers to participate and bring down premiums by increasing subsidies. Proponents have also cautioned that it might take years before the public option really gains a foothold with Washington state residents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not clear yet how successful these state-run public option plans will be, but it is possible that a public option may prove more popular than single-payer. For starters, while single-payer health care is popular among Democrats, <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000178-6298-d5c9-ab7c-e79a8aa50000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the public option still polls much better</a> among Republicans and independents. According to a Morning Consult/Politico poll from March 2021, the public option was roughly as popular as Medicare for All among Democrats — about 80 percent said they supported each. But support for the public option was much higher than support for Medicare for All among both Republicans and independents. Just 28 percent of Republicans and 50 percent of independents supported Medicare for All versus 56 percent of Republicans and 63 percent of independents who supported a public option. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, a public option may align more naturally with Americans’ existing views on the role of government in health care. Polls have long found that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/medicare-for-all-isnt-that-popular-even-among-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans still want a choice in their health care</a>, even though they believe that providing health insurance to the uninsured <a href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/94/2021/05/RWJF-Harvard-Report_FINAL-051321.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is the government’s responsibility</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, any health care reforms would be easier to implement on a federal level than a patchwork, state-by-state approach. But Washington, Colorado and Nevada <a href="https://time.com/6077007/states-public-option-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remain important tests</a> of state governments’ ability to implement a public option in lieu of action by the federal government. It’s not single-payer, but it’s still some of the most consequential health care reforms in decades — and a potential sign of where the debates over health care are heading.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Poll after poll makes it clear: Americans don’t want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine. In an <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/three-quarters-americans-support-us-taking-ukrainian-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos/Reuters poll</a> from March 3-4, adults opposed sending troops to Ukraine, 61 percent to 39 percent. In a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-biden-state-of-the-union-opinion-poll-2022-02-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/CBS News poll</a> from Feb. 24-28, Americans opposed sending U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, 71 percent to 29 percent. In a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/aa58ig9d3b/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist poll</a> from Feb. 26-March 1, they thought sending soldiers to Ukraine to fight Russian soldiers was a bad idea, 54 percent to 19 percent. And a <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/2/dfp_ukraine_a_toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 25-27 poll</a> from Data for Progress found that likely voters opposed taking military action against Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, 64 percent to 23 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These numbers are hardly surprising in a country not far removed from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-americans-are-unlikely-to-support-a-war-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two unpopular, drawn-out foreign wars</a> in Afghanistan and Iraq. What’s more of a surprise, though, is that Americans are actually open to going to war with Russia under different circumstances: namely, if Russia continues its aggression and invades one of the U.S.’s fellow members of NATO.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty</a>, NATO members are pledged to each other’s collective defense — if one of them is attacked, the others must respond. And Americans want the U.S. to stick to this obligation. Sixty-one percent of respondents to a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/e1pqcsj7ov/tabs_Russia_and_Ukraine_20220224.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov poll</a> from Feb. 24-28 said the U.S. should maintain its commitment to defend NATO allies, while only 13 percent said this commitment was no longer necessary. A <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University poll</a> from March 4-6 put it even more bluntly and got an even more emphatic answer: 79 percent of its respondents supported a U.S. military response to a hypothetical Russian attack on a NATO country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that same YouGov poll suggested that, in reality, Americans’ appetite for war would vary depending on which NATO country is attacked. According to the poll, adults supported using military force to defend Great Britain, 58 percent to 14 percent, and France, 55 percent to 15 percent. But they were less supportive of using force to defend other NATO members, such as Latvia (35 percent to 18 percent) and Croatia (34 percent to 21 percent).</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This raises the possibility that Americans are passing judgment on individual countries’ worthiness of having the U.S. rush to their defense. While some of this is probably due to Americans’ unfamiliarity with certain countries (46 percent said they didn’t know if the U.S. should defend Latvia or Croatia), it is still notable that just 14-15 percent opposed intervening if Russia attacked Great Britain or France, while about 20 percent opposed it for most Eastern European countries, and an even higher share (27 percent) opposed it for Turkey. Therefore, even in the nightmare scenario where Russia pushes beyond Ukraine and invades another country, we shouldn’t assume that Americans will automatically favor going to war over it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is, however, one set of poll questions that suggests Americans want to use military force against Russia <em>right now</em>. Multiple polls show support for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/05/world/europe/what-is-no-fly-zone.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no-fly zone</a> over Ukraine. In the Ipsos/Reuters survey, 74 percent of adults said the U.S. and NATO should impose a no-fly zone above Ukraine. And in the YouGov/The Economist poll, 45 percent of adults thought enforcing a no-fly zone was a good idea, while just 20 percent thought it was a bad idea. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It seems likely, though, that many Americans aren’t aware that enforcing a no-fly zone would mean <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/no-fly-zone-ukraine-war-russia-another-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shooting down Russian airplanes</a> that violate Ukrainian airspace (which, of course, could escalate into a greater, possibly nuclear conflict with Russia). In the YouGov/The Economist poll, a significant number of respondents (35 percent) said they weren’t sure whether a no-fly zone was a good or bad idea. And notably, Ipsos/Reuters didn’t even give respondents a “not sure” option, which could explain why it pegged support so high. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that a no-fly zone sounds to many Americans like a happy medium between two extreme options that we know from polling are both unpopular — going to war with Russia and doing nothing — and that’s why support initially registers so high. It’s impossible to know for sure, though, without more probing from pollsters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A separate <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/03/04/britons-oppose-ukraine-no-fly-zone-39-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov poll</a> from the United Kingdom (conducted March 3-4) gives us an idea of what more detailed polls might find, however. The poll explained, “Some are calling for a NATO ‘no-fly zone’ over Ukraine. This would mean that NATO countries like Britain would commit to shooting down any military aircraft attempting to fly over Ukraine. This could force the Russian military to stop launching air attacks against Ukraine, but it could also trigger an armed conflict between Russia and NATO countries if Russia chooses to ignore the no-fly zone.” Given this information, Britons said they opposed a no-fly zone, 39 percent to 28 percent (one-third were undecided).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, the U.K. isn’t the U.S., but the poll demonstrates how American support for a no-fly zone may be soft. After all, we already have plenty of clues that Americans may not fully grasp the gravity of a no-fly zone. According to a <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202203010901.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marist College/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll</a> from March 1-2, 70 percent of American adults were concerned (including 36 percent who were “very” concerned) that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine would lead to the use of nuclear weapons. And according to a <a href="https://www.marugroup.net/public-opinion-polls/us/the-us-stands-with-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 25-28 poll</a> from Canadian consumer-research firm Maru Public Opinion, 61 percent of Americans thought there was a real chance that Russia would use nuclear weapons against countries that interfered in Ukraine. Although Americans are certainly not immune to holding contradictory opinions, that doesn’t sound like a country that’s ready and willing to shoot down Russian airplanes.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">With <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/texas-election-biden-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas’s primary on March 1</a>, the 2022 primary election season has officially begun. For most incumbents, that means working to win renomination by appealing to their party’s supporters and fending off any serious primary challengers. But for a small group of House Republicans, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their primary campaigns are complicated</a> by their vote to impeach then-President Donald Trump in January 2021, a move that outraged many Republican voters and <a href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/scgop-votes-to-censure-rep-tom-rice-for-voting-to-impeach-donald-trump/35371761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned condemnations</a> from <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/rep-herrera-beutler-censured-over-trump-impeachment-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many local and state Republican officials</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021, three have retired instead of running again, while all but one of the other seven has a Trump-endorsed primary opponent.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xPpzTTGOK_UAl1BGLW3ATw4VycJdsDArkgaZ4lV486s/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;candidate filing deadlines&lt;/a&gt; haven’t yet passed for these seven incumbents, so they could all still theoretically change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> That means primary voters in nearly all of these districts will be able to choose whether they want to punish disloyalty to Trump and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trumps-hold-on-the-gop-still-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move the GOP into even closer alignment</a> with Trumpism.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Opposition to these incumbents ramped up in February, most notably when Trump decided to put his stamp of approval on primary challengers in two of the three reddest districts represented by pro-impeachment Republicans: South Carolina’s 7th Congressional District and Washington’s 4th Congressional District. Trump’s endorsement <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t guaranteed to make someone a winner</a>, but there is reason to think it can be helpful: Republican pollster Echelon Insights <a href="https://twitter.com/EchelonInsights/status/1499081885485514756/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in February</a> that an endorsement by Trump without support from local GOP leaders would give a Republican primary candidate a narrow edge of 3 percentage points, for instance. And while that was far weaker than a candidate who had backing from both Trump <em>and</em> local party leaders (+29 points), Trump’s support by itself was valuable, as candidates backed by only local officials (-10 points) or by neither Trump nor local leaders (-22 points) performed notably worse.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Echelon, this question was conducted via conjoint analysis. Respondents of each party were given five matchups between hypothetical candidates assigned a series of attributes, such as age, professional background, endorser or political approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with South Carolina’s 7th District. At the start of February, <a href="https://wpde.com/news/local/former-president-donald-trump-endorses-russell-fry-calls-tom-rice-a-coward" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump endorsed</a> state Rep. Russell Fry in his bid to take down Rep. Tom Rice. Trump was likely attracted to Fry in part because the state legislator <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/myrtle-beach/politics/donald-trump-endorses-russell-fry-in-primary-challenge-to-sc-congressman-tom-rice/article_863bba62-8387-11ec-ab26-63ae4d94c45d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has backed Trump’s false claim</a> that the 2020 election was illegitimate. But Fry may also be best positioned to challenge Rice: He has outraised all the other challengers <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/SC/07/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still in the race</a>, and he came in third in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mq0hidvbl0dklfm/PollingProfessor-MemoFiveRaceSynopsis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary poll conducted by SoCo Strategies</a> back in early December. (Moreover, in a boon to Fry, the second-place candidate <a href="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/politics-government/article257828103.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> just before Trump announced his support for Fry.) As such, Trump’s endorsement could help opposition to Rice consolidate around Fry in the <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/SC/07/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still-crowded primary field</a>, improving Fry’s chances of advancing to a possible runoff against Rice, as South Carolina is <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-runoffs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of seven states</a> that requires a candidate to win a majority of the primary vote to capture a party’s nomination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then, about a week after backing Fry, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/trump-endorses-loren-culp-in-challenge-to-wa-rep-dan-newhouse-who-voted-for-impeachment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump endorsed</a> Loren Culp, the former police chief of a small Washington town, in Washington’s 4th District against Rep. Dan Newhouse. Culp isn’t as strong of a pick as Fry — he’s struggled with fundraising, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/WA/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising less than $150,000</a> through the end of 2021 — but he may have caught Trump’s eye in his 2020 gubernatorial bid when he <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/loren-culp-refusing-to-concede-washington-gubernatorial-race-turns-on-top-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to accept defeat</a>, citing unsubstantiated claims about election irregularities. He <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=53&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost by 13 percentage points</a>. It remains to be seen whether Culp will gain more traction with Trump’s endorsement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Washington has its own primary wrinkle, though. It uses a top-two system in which candidates from all parties run on the same ballot and the top-two finishers advance to the general election, regardless of party. This could potentially help Newhouse, as it’s not just Culp running against him. Jerrod Sessler, a former NASCAR driver, has thrown down about $350,000 <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2WA04165/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of his own money</a> and could attract some Republican-leaning support in the primary, too. But if Culp and Sessler are able to split the GOP voting base while Democrats largely back one candidate, it’s possible Culp or even Sessler edge out Newhouse for one of the two spots and join the Democrat in the general. Still, this district <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20161108/congressional-district-4-us-representative_bycounty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has sometimes sent</a> two Republicans to the November election, so it’s possible that it ends up being Newhouse and one of his GOP challengers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another endorsement raised eyebrows in February, but this one wasn’t from Trump. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/kevin-mccarthy-harriet-hageman-endorsement/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his support for former Republican National Committee member Harriet Hageman</a>, the most prominent opponent of Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney (who has been a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-voters-say-they-dont-mind-trump-critics-but-liz-cheneys-ouster-says-otherwise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vocal critic of Trump</a>). Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/09/politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-cheney-challenger/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had already backed Hageman</a> in September, but it’s still highly unusual for a party’s legislative leader to endorse a colleague’s primary challenger. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Wyoming GOP appears to be done with Cheney, too, having <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-liz-cheney-ousted-wyoming-gop/story?id=81206853" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a resolution</a> in November that essentially excommunicated her from the party. Helpfully for Hageman, most other high-profile Republicans <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/572403-third-republican-drops-out-of-race-to-replace-cheney-after-trump-endorses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have left the race</a>, which should make it easier for anti-Cheney forces to coalesce around a challenger. Cheney already looks to be in real trouble. The early December <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mq0hidvbl0dklfm/PollingProfessor-MemoFiveRaceSynopsis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoCo Strategies poll</a> found Hageman leading Cheney 39 percent to 19 percent, and prior surveys <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1420482244334952448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found Cheney struggling</a>. Cheney does have a massive financial advantage, though: By the end of 2021, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/WY/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she had raised</a> $7.2 million and had $4.7 million in the bank. By comparison, Hageman had garnered roughly $750,000 and had around $380,000 cash on hand. Cheney also appears set on staying in the race despite her difficulties, and some observers have speculated that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/liz-cheneys-re-election-prospects-doubt-national-profile-grows-rcna17265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she may even be looking</a> to take on Trump and his supporters nationally in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cheney isn’t alone in having to push back against fierce intraparty opposition, though. While he hasn’t officially announced that he’s seeking reelection, Republican Rep. Fred Upton’s campaign <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/22/fred-upton-running-congress-tv-ads/6898798001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began running ads at the end of February</a>, so it looks like he’s angling to run again, or at least testing the waters. <a href="https://youtu.be/UMnMComd6SM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the ad</a>, Upton told the camera, “If you want a rubber stamp as your congressman, I’m the wrong guy,” and Upton isn’t kidding: He’s likely to be the only pro-impeachment House Republican seeking reelection <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-house-republicans-who-voted-for-bidens-infrastructure-bill-could-face-serious-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who also voted</a> for the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package — the other three have announced their retirements — which has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/criticism-gop-infrastructure-bill-backers-grows-louder-mccarthy-stays-quiet-n1283759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made him a target of the right</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while Upton has given his opponents plenty of ammunition, he might also be in a better position than Cheney thanks to the particulars of his primary race in Michigan’s new 4th District. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-house-republicans-who-voted-for-bidens-infrastructure-bill-could-face-serious-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upton faces fellow</a> Rep. Bill Huizenga, a more conservative incumbent who opted to run here after <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his old district was carved up in redistricting</a>. This makes Upton the only pro-impeachment Republican also running against another incumbent, but both Upton and Huizenga must face Trump-endorsed state Rep. Steve Carra, <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/07/trump-endorses-michigan-primary-challenger-u-s-rep-upton/5757497001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has pushed Trump’s fraudulent claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen</a>. Provided Trump sticks with Carra, whom <a href="https://www.sturgisjournal.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/08/donald-trump-has-endorsed-steve-carra-bid-unseat-u-s-rep-fred-upton/5762731001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he endorsed before Huizenga also challenged Upton</a>, that could actually make it easier for Upton to win a plurality if opposition to Upton splits between his two challengers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for the other three pro-impeachment Republicans who are running again, two of them face potentially competitive primary contests. In Michigan’s 3rd District, freshman Rep. Peter Meijer must contend with John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-congress-michigan-grand-rapids-impeachments-bfbb4564f73f2afdda6c5dbcb969c4ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the former president’s backing</a>. Meijer has <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominated Gibbs in fundraising</a>, but a <a href="https://twitter.com/allymutnick/status/1496198857323069444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll sponsored by EMILY’s List</a> found Meijer only leading Gibbs 26 percent to 13 percent, and trailing once voters were told that Trump supported Gibbs. This survey could definitely point to potential danger for Meijer, although we need to treat it with caution considering EMILY’s List, as an organization that backs female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights, would like to see Meijer lose his primary to improve the Democrats’ chance of winning the swingy 3rd District. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Washington’s 3rd District, meanwhile, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler faces veteran Joe Kent, who has Trump’s endorsement. This is another top-two primary, but there’s already reason to think Herrera Beutler might find herself coming up short, as a <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WA03-22Primary-Feb-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February poll</a> from GOP pollster Trafalgar Group found her running close to even with Kent in the low-to-mid 20s while Democrat Brent Hennrich led with 33 percent. If Hennrich does win most Democratic support in the top-two race, Herrera Beutler will have a challenging time finishing in the top two, as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mq0hidvbl0dklfm/PollingProfessor-MemoFiveRaceSynopsis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other polling</a> has also shown her struggling to keep up with Kent among Republican voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, Republican Rep. David Valadao is the only pro-impeachment Republican in the House who lacks a Trump-endorsed primary challenger, and it’s unclear whether Trump will wade into this race. (Like Washington, California also uses the top-two primary system.) That may be in part because Valadao looks to have the toughest general election path, as California’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new 22nd District</a> is notably bluer than any of the other districts discussed here. Still, Valadao has previously won <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VfkHtzBTP5gf4jAu8tcVQgsBJ1IDvXEHjuMqYlOgYbA/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Democratic-leaning turf</a>, so it could be Valadao who faces the least amount of electoral danger compared to the other House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump last year.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A week and a half after Russian troops invaded Ukraine, we look at how Americans view the U.S. response so far. They overwhelmingly approve of the sweeping economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed, and a significant share support going further. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew analyzes new polling suggesting that Americans support enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine and banning the purchase of Russian oil even if that increases gas prices at home. They also discuss the accuracy of opinion polling conducted in Russia and Ukraine, and senior writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux discusses the possible legal case against former President Donald Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Abortion is a constitutional right — at least for now. But for many women, it’s a right that comes with an asterisk.</p>
<p>Under current law, states can’t ban abortion until after a fetus reaches viability, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/12/01/what-is-viability/">which usually happens</a> around <strong>23 and 24 weeks</strong> of pregnancy. Some states don’t have limits on when abortions can happen, but most do — which means women have anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to make their decision and get the procedure.</p>
<p>Those restrictions don’t always seem especially burdensome, at least on their own. An ultrasound, a waiting period, a few hundred dollars — what’s the big deal? But when we talked to women about what their abortions were like, they told us that in real life the restrictions pile on top of each other. They add up in a way that’s expensive, bureaucratic, confusing and exhausting.</p>
<p>Even in states like California, where there are few formal state restrictions, access to abortion can feel threadbare and fragile. And this is what abortion looks like while it’s still a constitutional right. All of these burdens could quickly morph and multiply if the Supreme Court upholds <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-abortion-law-is-unprecedented-but-the-supreme-court-isnt-treating-it-that-way/">Mississippi’s ban on abortion</a> after <strong>15 weeks</strong> later this year.</p>

<h3>It makes me feel like even in places like California, we’re feeling confident and preaching to the choir about how abortion should be legal, but nobody thinks about what it means for abortion to be accessible — the human component of how this process actually feels.</h3>
<p>–Emily, California</p>
<p>Four weeks or much more</p>
<p>The amount of time a woman has to get an abortion depends a lot on when she finds out she’s pregnant. And this is where the math starts to get complicated. Because it’s very difficult to figure out exactly when conception happened, doctors count the weeks of pregnancy from the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period — which is to say, at least a week and a half before she actually became pregnant.</p>
<p>Using this unintuitive calculation, the earliest a woman can find out she’s pregnant is about <strong>four weeks</strong> into her pregnancy. That’s happening more and more, thanks to highly sensitive pregnancy tests. But for lots of reasons, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5269518/">most women</a> don’t find out they’re pregnant until they’re further along — particularly if their cycle isn’t regular, they don’t have any pregnancy symptoms or they’ve never been pregnant before. Researchers have found, too, that the later a woman finds out she’s pregnant, the later she tends to have an abortion.</p>

<p>But knowing how far along the pregnancy is doesn’t matter just because of state-imposed limits. It also affects pretty much everything else about the process, including what kind of abortion a woman can get. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions">A Guttmacher Institute report</a> published last month estimated that more than half (54 percent) of abortions in 2020 happened using medication, up from 39 percent in 2017. Abortion pills are often cheaper and easier to get than than surgical abortions since clinics can offer them even if they’re not a surgical facility. But <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information">medication abortions</a> are available up to only <strong>10 weeks</strong> of pregnancy.</p>
<h3>“</h3>
<h3>I was probably eight weeks along when I found out. I had a little bit of nausea, morning sickness, but other than that, I didn’t really have any symptoms. I hid it for a few weeks and then I realized, OK, I have to do something. … By that point, a surgical abortion was my only choice. I couldn’t take the pill.</h3>
<p>–Heather, Ohio</p>
<p>Abortion is currently legal until at least <strong>22 weeks</strong> of pregnancy in almost all states — and some states have no limits on when it can be obtained — but that doesn’t mean every clinic offers abortion up till that point. Medical experts told us that as the second trimester progresses, abortion procedures get more complicated and fewer providers offer them. (Abortions after 21 weeks of pregnancy are extremely rare, and only a small fraction of abortion providers perform them.) Practically speaking, that means that abortion access is even more limited in some places. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/us/mississippi-abortion-clinic-supreme-court.html">Mississippi’s lone abortion clinic</a>, for example, offers abortions up to only <strong>16 weeks</strong>, even though the state allows abortion until <strong>20 weeks</strong> (at least for now). This is an issue even in liberal states. According to our analysis of clinic websites, a sizable chunk of California’s clinics offer only medication abortion, which means they can’t serve women who are past <strong>10 weeks</strong> of pregnancy. And other California clinics perform surgical abortions only through the end of the first trimester.</p>
<p>100 abortion clinics or just one</p>
<p>The pink lines on a positive pregnancy test look the same whether it’s sitting on a bathroom counter in Jackson, Mississippi, or Los Angeles. But for the woman who took that test, where she lives will determine whether she has lots of options for where to get an abortion, or just a few.</p>
<p>The vast majority of abortions happen in <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-incidence-service-availability-us-2017">freestanding clinics</a> scattered across the country. But those clinics aren’t spread out evenly — a national map looks like someone lobbed a handful of dots at each of the coasts, sprinkled a few more in the middle of the country, then called it a day.</p>
<p>According to a dataset of abortion providers compiled by Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who studies reproductive policy, about one-third of the country’s abortion providers are in New York and California alone. Other states have fewer abortion clinics, particularly in the Midwest and South, which means that travel times are often much longer. It also means that clinics outside of cities are often serving a much larger population, which can mean longer wait times for appointments. On the West Coast, where abortion clinics are relatively plentiful, that means travel distances can be long for women who live in rural areas. And in the heart of the country, abortion clinics are even more scarce, leading to longer travel times <em>and</em> longer waits.</p>

Congestion is measured by the “average service population,” which is the average number of women of childbearing age per abortion facility in a set of counties that share a common nearest destination county or commuting zone to obtain an abortion.

<h3>I Googled around, searched for Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics. There was an abortion clinic in Wichita, but I don’t think they had any appointments available, so Planned Parenthood was the best option. It was about four and a half, five hours from me. … I missed class, left early in the morning to drive halfway across the entire state. A whole day out of my life just to get an abortion.</h3>
<p>–Kaila, Kansas</p>
<p>Still, in states with dozens of providers, figuring out where to get an abortion can be hard. Searching around online, it can be difficult to tell whether you’ve landed on a clinic that actually offers abortions or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-ex4Q-z-is">crisis pregnancy center</a> that tries to convince women to choose another path. Even trusted doctors may not be much help. Chances are, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170127/">a woman’s own OB-GYN</a> won’t offer an abortion. At Catholic hospitals, which make up <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2759762">a significant share of American health care providers</a>, doctors are prohibited from providing abortions. Some Catholic hospitals also <a href="https://bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/news/how-do-catholic-hospitals-handle-reproductive-health-referrals">bar their doctors</a> from referring women seeking abortions to clinics that perform the procedure.</p>
<p>Getting through to a clinic — and making an appointment — can also be a challenge. That’s another factor that varies widely from region to region. Following Texas’s six-week abortion ban, clinics in states adjacent to Texas have seen <a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/10/abortion-clinic-wait-times-surge-in-states-surrounding-texas/">wait times skyrocket</a>, commonly exceeding <strong>two weeks.</strong> But simply residing in a state with few or no abortion restrictions doesn’t mean a woman can get an appointment right away. Some women who had abortions in bluer states, like California, told us they had to wait <strong>a week or more</strong> for an appointment. And when we checked appointment availability at 58 abortion providers across California, we found that wait times were all over the place. Some waits were as little as a day in big cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco, but others were up to two weeks in less urban areas, especially rural northern and central California. That might not sound like a noteworthy delay, but when you’re pregnant and don’t want to be, an extra week can feel like a lifetime.</p>
<h3>“</h3>
<h3>When I finally found an abortion clinic near me, I had to keep calling… I kept pushing repeat over and over again. And even then, my appointment was 10 days out… That’s when it clicked for me — that even though I live in California, where abortion’s legal, there’s a difference between legality and permissibility. Whether you’re theoretically allowed to get it and whether you actually can.</h3>
<p>–Emily, California</p>
<p>Asking a judge’s permission</p>
<p>Most women who get abortions get to choose who they tell about the procedure, even if that means telling no one at all. But that’s not the case for girls under the age of 18. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/parental-involvement-minors-abortions">Most states require</a> some level of parental involvement in a minor’s decision to get an abortion. That could mean notifying at least one parent, requiring one parent to give consent, requiring both parents to give consent, or requiring parental notification and consent.</p>
<p>CODEGAIAILMDMNMTNHSDWVALARAZIDINKYLAMAMIMONCNEOHPARISCTNWIKSMSNDFLOKTXUTVAWYData as of Feb. 1, 2022.SOURCE: GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE</p>
<p>Some states have limited exceptions, allowing minors to bypass these rules if it’s a medical emergency or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. But for the most part, minors who want to avoid involving their parents have to get a judge’s permission to get an abortion instead. And getting a judge to sign off, a process known as “judicial bypass,” can sometimes take weeks. <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305491">Research has found</a> that even in restrictive states like Texas, most judicial bypass requests are eventually approved — but not always.</p>
<h3>“</h3>
<h3>For my meeting with the judge, I had to memorize every single step of the procedure. … It meant memorizing all the tools that were needed and what was going into my body and how my abortion worked. I had to acknowledge that abortion could cause death, … that the person who got me pregnant would pay child support and that adoption is an option. It was like cramming for a test, the scariest possible test. Talking about it still makes me shake four years later.</h3>
<p>–Anna, Texas</p>
<p>Anywhere from $500 to more than $1,000</p>
<p>Most women who get abortions <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-abortion-has-changed-since-1973/">are lower-income</a>. Figuring out how to pay for the procedure is often the biggest challenge they face, too, as <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/the-hyde-amendment-and-coverage-for-abortion-services/">federal funds can’t be used for abortion</a> except in limited circumstances, which has made it challenging to cover abortion under Medicaid. Some states use their own Medicaid funds to cover abortion, but <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/abortion-under-medicaid/?activeTab=map&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedDistributions=funds-all-or-most-medically-necessary-abortions-exceeding-federal-requirements&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">most don’t</a>.</p>
<p>Other states have <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/regulating-insurance-coverage-abortion">made it practically impossible</a> to avoid paying out of pocket for an abortion. They restrict abortion coverage either in health insurance plans sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, in insurance plans for public employees or in private insurance plans written in the state. In a handful of states, such as California and Illinois, private insurance is required to cover abortion — but patients with <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-07/california-to-make-abortion-cheaper-unlike-many-states">high-deductible plans</a> sometimes end up paying out-of-pocket anyway.</p>

<h3>[A clinic employee] literally came and told me that my insurance didn’t go through while I was talking to the doctor. … They said, “Don’t give her the medication. We don’t take that insurance.” So I had to make a phone call on the spot to come up with the $700 for the pills. At that point, it was about two weeks since I had found out I was pregnant, and I did not want to delay this any more. … Luckily, I was able to make the call. It was embarrassing and really demoralizing.</h3>
<p>–Larada, California</p>
<p>The out-of-pocket cost of an abortion can vary a lot. A California agency <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-07/california-to-make-abortion-cheaper-unlike-many-states">recently reviewed abortion costs</a> and found that patients in the state paid an average of $306 for a medication abortion and $887 for a surgical abortion. And in 2014, <a href="https://www.whijournal.com/article/S1049-3867(14)00004-8/fulltext">a study conducted at 30 clinics across the country</a> found that when insurance or Medicaid didn’t pay for an abortion, the median cost was $575. That varied a lot, though, depending on the stage of pregnancy at which the woman was trying to get an abortion. A first-trimester abortion, for instance, could cost less than $500, but a second-trimester abortion could cost almost twice as much.</p>
<p>And to someone already struggling to make ends meet, even the less expensive procedures aren’t cheap. In the study, more than half of the women who paid out-of-pocket were handing over more than one-third of their monthly income when factoring in the cost of travel and the procedure. Some women <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1049386713000224">delay bills or avoid buying groceries</a> to cover the cost.</p>
<h3>“</h3>
<h3>We had a remaining balance of almost $500, which was really stressful because I didn’t have the money and I couldn’t ask my mom. It was like, Oh shit, we went through this whole process and maybe we can’t even pay for it. So my partner’s mom talked to his dad and told him what was going on, and he paid the rest. It saved us. And I felt so guilty because I knew that was almost one-third of their rent.</h3>
<p>–Veronika, Texas</p>
<p>Many women turn to family members or abortion funds to pay for the procedure and cover related costs, like travel. But the process of cobbling the funds together takes time, and there’s a catch-22 for lower-income women: The longer it takes to get the money together, the more expensive the procedure will be. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4151926/">A 2014 study in the American Journal of Public Health</a> found that two-thirds of women who were near the gestational limit of the clinic where they ultimately received an abortion said that travel and procedure costs delayed getting their abortion, compared with 37 percent of women who had an abortion in the first trimester.</p>

<p>Asking family members for help isn’t always an easy option, either. Many women told us they didn’t want to talk to people who were close to them about their abortion, fearing they’d be judged or criticized. For some, that meant making a vulnerable request of people they didn’t know well.</p>
<h3>“</h3>
<h3>Insurance did not cover a thing. [The abortion] was between $700 and $800. That’s a lot of money when you’re low-income. We had to pay it all out of pocket, and if it wasn’t for the grandma of the guy who got me pregnant, I might have a kid right now, honestly. She paid for half of it.</h3>
<p>–Heather, Ohio</p>
<p>Protesters and restrictions at the clinic</p>
<p>In some states, arriving at the abortion clinic is just the beginning of a several-day ordeal — starting with navigating the protesters who gather outside abortion providers, hoping to convince women not to go through with the procedure. Several women told us that simply walking into the clinic was a more jarring experience than they’d been expecting.</p>
<h3>“</h3>
<h3>There was a young girl outside of the clinic, and she was holding rosary beads and just looking at the people who were going in and out. I remember looking at her and thinking, You have no idea, you just don’t understand my situation. Before I got pregnant, I had always been pro-choice … but I didn’t think I would have an abortion. It made me realize that in this situation you don’t know what you would do. But there are so many people hating you for your decision.</h3>
<p>–MJ, Texas</p>
<p>Once inside the clinic, though, restrictions can start to envelop the patient — adding time, expense and sometimes confusion. According to <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion">an analysis from the Guttmacher Institute</a>, a majority of states (33) require some form of pre-abortion counseling, which often includes scary and medically inaccurate information, such as telling women that abortion is linked to breast cancer or infertility. (<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html">Neither</a> of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/well/can-an-abortion-affect-your-fertility.html">is true</a>.) Half of states (26) impose a waiting period between when a woman receives the counseling and when she can have an abortion. And in 13 states, the counseling has to be conducted in-person before the waiting period begins, which means the woman must make at least two trips to the clinic. In most states with a waiting period, the waiting period is 24 hours, but two states have a 48-hour waiting period and six states require women to wait 72 hours.</p>

<p>The visits add up. <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/msrepro/files/2021/09/Abortion-Patient-Challenges-brief-MRHAP.pdf">A study conducted in 2019 in Mississippi</a>, which has a 24-hour waiting period, found that almost half (43 percent) of patients traveled more than 50 miles one way to get to the clinic, and 57 percent had to miss work. Some women we spoke with had to return to the clinic three or four times — not just for the counseling and the abortion procedure itself, but also for follow-up visits and ultrasounds.</p>
<p>In 17 states, an ultrasound is required, even though that’s <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/requirements-ultrasound">not considered medically necessary</a> for a first-trimester abortion. Often, the ultrasounds are pretty uncomfortable, too; several of the women we spoke with had a vaginal ultrasound, rather than the abdominal ultrasound they were expecting. In six states, the provider has to display and describe the ultrasound image. And in eight states, the provider has to offer the woman an opportunity to view the image.</p>

<h3>They brought me to a room, and I got a sonogram. It was vaginal, which was more invasive than I was expecting. At some point, they were like, “The state requires us to show the screen to you, but you don’t have to look. … We have to tell you the size — it’s the size of a blueberry.” … Every little burden, every little inconvenience — it felt intentional. Like someone had known what they were doing … and they wanted me to feel shame.</h3>

<p>For many women, the time it takes to navigate state-imposed restrictions isn’t just an annoyance. It means more days off work, more hours of lost pay, more childcare gaps to fill, more gas to buy. In some states where doctors are <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion">required to give abortion pills in person</a>, it can take three visits to get a medication abortion — one for mandatory in-person counseling, another to take the pill, a third to make sure that the pregnancy is gone.</p>
<p>All of these barriers are psychologically and physically taxing. Women told us they felt like they were being punished. They felt like they must have done something wrong. They felt alone.</p>

<h3>With the repeated visits, having to wait more than a week from when I knew to when I could actually make the appointment, … it honestly felt personally hurtful because all of these steps are due to people’s opinion of what you’re doing. … It’s not that I think I should be ashamed of this, but that’s the constant communication throughout the process. The reason I’m supposed to have the ultrasound and get counseling is because everyone thinks this should weigh on you so heavily that you’ll realize what you’re doing is wrong. … I have to act like it’s something shameful, and I don’t feel like it’s something shameful. That’s where the guilt starts.</h3>
<p>–Stella, Mississippi</p>
<p>In states like California, where access to abortion has relatively few legal restrictions, some women were still surprised by how difficult it was to get an appointment and pay for the procedure. In our review of appointment availability at 58 clinics in California, we found that at 21 percent of abortion providers, the soonest available slot was a week or more away. Twelve percent of the providers said their soonest available appointment was 10 days or more in the future. And while abortion is covered by Medicaid in the state, which means the procedure could cost nothing for some women, <a href="https://californiaglobe.com/articles/lawmakers-announce-return-of-bill-that-would-end-abortion-procedure-copays-in-ca/">high deductibles</a> can leave women with private insurance footing the entire bill. Several of the women we spoke with told us that they realized for the first time that the South isn’t the only place where it can be hard to get an abortion.</p>
<h3>“</h3>
<h3>In California, it’s supposed to be easy to get an abortion. But for me, it wasn’t easy. Even though … I was doing everything I could to get it done, it felt like the world was telling me no.</h3>
<p>–Jessy, California</p>
<p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-hears-historic-case-fate-abortion-rights/story?id=81488696">may soon dismantle</a> constitutional protections for abortion. But in practice, this right has already been hollowed out in much of the country. States with more restrictions have spent decades trying to make it as difficult as possible to get an abortion, and they’ve been successful. Even outside of those states, though, having an abortion is often complicated, expensive and hard to talk about — a secret that some women hold onto for years, never telling more than a few people. To those women, abortion didn’t really feel like a right — unless a right is something you have to struggle at every step to exercise.</p>]]></description>

They can be personal projects and don’t necessarily need to be journalistic.<strong><br><br></strong>At the time of application, the applicant must be enrolled in an accredited college/university and taking at least one class in the semester/quarter prior to participation in the internship program, or the applicant must have graduated from a college/university within six months.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The ongoing war in Ukraine appears to have Americans in a bind: While roughly half of U.S. adults want to impose some type of punishment on or sanction against the Russian government for waging a war on Ukraine, another chunk of the country thinks it’s best for President Biden and others in power to stay out of European affairs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">My colleague <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-currently-support-sanctioning-russia-for-invading-ukraine-but-are-reluctant-to-deploy-troops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley previously documented</a> the sort of quandary many Americans are in regarding the war. And recent polling suggests that most voters are on the fence on where to go from here. That said, certain things <em>are</em> clearer based on recent polling: For starters, Americans are still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-will-americans-grade-bidens-handling-of-the-crisis-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat dissatisfied with Biden’s response</a> to the crisis. As my colleague <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-will-americans-grade-bidens-handling-of-the-crisis-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich wrote</a> the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden already had <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low approval ratings</a>, including on his handling of foreign policy. Unfortunately for the president, though, his numbers haven’t significantly improved on the issue since. According to a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/two-five-americans-approve-president-biden-handling-russia-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos</a> poll fielded in late February and early March, only 40 percent said they approved of the way Biden has handled Russia, while 43 percent said the same about how he’s handled Ukraine. Moreover, per the same survey, most Americans (63 percent) are against sending the U.S. military to Ukraine to help defend them against Russian forces — a reality <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60499385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden has said is off the table</a>. Other polls yield a similar finding: According to an early February <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/international/articles-reports/2022/02/11/americans-want-support-ukraine-not-us-troops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov</a> survey, 55 percent of Americans said that sending troops to Ukraine to fight Russian soldiers was a bad idea.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond that, though, public opinion is a bit murky, and the data suggests that Americans have mixed feelings on the U.S. response — whether that’s things like imposing sanctions on Russia (which experts warn <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/politics/russia-oil-exports-sanctions-ukraine-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could raise gas prices here</a>), <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/natos-article-pull-us-allies-russia-ukraine-conflict/story?id=83108600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowing Ukraine to join NATO</a> or sending U.S. troops to NATO countries in Eastern Europe. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to that Reuters/Ipsos survey, roughly one-third of Americans (34 percent) said Ukraine’s current problems should stay their own. And per the Economist/YouGov survey, adults were split on a number of potential courses of action. On imposing economic sanctions on Russia, a bare majority (50 percent) thought this was a good idea, while 20 percent disagreed. Meanwhile, allowing Ukraine to join NATO earned the support of 43 percent of adults, compared with 15 percent who said that was a bad idea. And 42 percent of citizens said they wanted the U.S. to send financial aid to Ukraine; 24 percent did not. What’s somewhat striking from YouGov’s survey, though, is that large shares of Americans are simply unsure how the U.S. should respond. Thirty-one percent and 42 percent of respondents, respectively, said they didn’t know whether it was a good or bad idea for the U.S. to impose economic sanctions on Russia or let Ukraine join NATO. But, to some extent, these numbers should be expected, as Americans often <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Opinion-Cambridge-Political-Psychology/dp/0521407869" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t know a lot about foreign policy</a> and <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00602.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look to political elites</a> to signal what to do. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the situation in Europe is fluid, so these numbers could change with time. Greater media coverage of the war will likely shape Americans’ opinions on the issue, but it’s also possible that more people will begin paying attention if things start to affect them personally — or if they start to feel even more strongly about Biden’s inability to handle international affairs. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/russia-waging-war-ukraine-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-83167916</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, there’s already evidence that public opinion on the crisis in Ukraine has changed — particularly on the question of whether what’s happening overseas will increase the cost of goods and services, like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraine-crisis-led-gas-price-surge-revives-demand-inflation-hedges-2022-02-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gas prices</a>. On imposing additional sanctions against Russia, 69 percent of Americans said they were in favor, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/broad-majority-americans-support-russia-sanctions-poll-2022-02-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos</a> poll that was conducted in the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2022-02-24/explainer-why-did-russia-invade-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two days prior to the invasion</a> on Feb. 24. But despite widespread support, only about half of the public said those sanctions were worthwhile if they led to more expensive gas prices. A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/politics/cnn-poll-russia-ukraine-us-aid/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN/SSRS</a> poll fielded just after the invasion began found a similar result: Per the survey, 71 percent of Americans agreed that the U.S. should consider gas prices when deciding its actions toward Russia, a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-natural-gas-prices-vault-as-sanctions-threaten-russias-commodity-exports-11646049246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major oil and natural gas producer</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond that, it’s hard to tell just how much Americans’ views on the war could change, especially given how volatile the situation is. But, so far, evidence suggests that as time goes on, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-74-percent-of-americans-call-russias-ukraine-invasion-unjustified-142128676.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the public is paying more attention</a> to European affairs. The CNN/SSRS poll found that 79 percent of adults were following the war at least somewhat closely, though only 3 in 10 said they were watching it <em>very </em>closely. Here at FiveThirtyEight, we’ll continue to cover what’s happening in Europe, but unless the war <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/26/1083283294/americans-react-to-how-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-could-impact-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a more direct effect</a> on Americans’ day-to-day lives, it’s possible that the public won’t have strong opinions on this conflict moving forward. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>According to recent polling by <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/28/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-nomination-poll/">Politico/Morning Consult</a>, almost a majority of voters (46 percent) are in favor of the Senate confirming U.S. Circuit Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/">to replace retiring</a> Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. What’s more, the survey suggests that appointing Jackson to the high court garnered more initial support than that of any of President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominees. Morning Consult asked voters about the prior three nominees (Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch) when they were nominated as well and found that Jackson netted the most initial support overall, although Gorsuch came in a close second at 43 percent. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, whose confirmation was <a href="https://time.com/5677929/new-york-times-brett-kavanaugh-sexual-misconduct/">mired in allegations</a> of sexual misconduct and sexual assault, ranked third at 40 percent, while Barrett, whose confirmation was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/10/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-gop/616727/">rushed by Republicans</a> in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election, earned the support of 37 percent of voters at the time of her nomination.</li></ul><ul><li>As new COVID-19 case numbers <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html">decrease nationally</a>, some polling suggests that Americans are less willing to take the necessary safety precautions to protect themselves and others from spreading the coronavirus. Per a recent survey from <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/declines-in-covid-concerns-and-mask-mandate-support/">The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>, just a bare majority of Americans (50 percent) approve of mask mandates — down 5 percentage points from August and 25 points from December. Republicans, many of whom <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-and-democrats-see-covid-19-very-differently-is-that-making-people-sick/">were against mask mandates</a> to begin with, were much less likely (22 percent) to say they were in favor of mask mandates compared with independents (43 percent) and Democrats (77 percent). Part of what’s driving the downtick in taking more precautions is that many Americans aren’t as worried about COVID-19 now as they were in December — at the time, 36 percent said they were extremely or very worried about it versus 24 percent who said the same in February — but Democrats and Republicans still have very different ideas about the types of precautionary measures needed.</li></ul><ul><li>A majority of U.S. adults said they believe that younger generations face more challenges than their parents did, according to polling from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/28/most-in-the-u-s-say-young-adults-today-face-more-challenges-than-their-parents-generation-in-some-key-areas/">Pew Research Center</a> released late last month. Per the survey, issues involving money and savings were top-of-mind. A whopping 72 percent and 71 percent, respectively, said that things like saving for the future and paying for college are harder for young adults today. </li></ul><ul><li>At one point, it seemed like conservative Americans were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/politics/republicans-leaving-fox-news-trump-analysis/index.html">abandoning Fox News</a>, opting instead for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extremes-of-the-gop-have-moved-beyond-fox-news/">more right-wing outlets</a> like One America News Network and Newsmax. The reason for the switch? Last year, some GOPers reportedly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2020/12/27/fox-news-viewers-switch-to-newsmax/">started to feel</a> as though Fox News wasn’t doing enough to address Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and that its coverage was becoming too similar to that of other mainstream media outlets. February polling from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/28/cable-news-credibility/">Morning Consult</a>, however, suggests that Fox News’s credibility is improving among rank-and-file Republicans. According to the survey, 69 percent of Republicans now say they find the outlet “credible,” compared with 59 percent who felt the same in May. Moreover, the share of Republicans who said they trust Fox News a lot or some also jumped 10 percentage points since May — from 60 percent to 70 percent. Of course, that doesn’t mean the party’s voters are abandoning Newsmax and OANN. Morning Consult found that two-fifths of Republicans ranked Newsmax as credible, while 31 percent saw OANN in the same light.</li></ul><ul><li>According to a February <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/70et3512ml/tabs_Life_and_Society_20220222.pdf">YouGov</a> survey, 37 percent of Americans believe demons exist, and 36 percent believe in ghosts. There was little confidence among the general public that werewolves and vampires exist, however; only 7 percent were firm in their belief that each of those entities exist. One fascinating find: Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to believe in demons. Half of Republicans (50 percent) said demons are real, compared with 3 in 10 Democrats (29 percent) who said the same. Republicans were slightly more likely than Democrats to believe in other supernatural beings (37 percent to 26 percent) and ghosts (38 percent to 33 percent). </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval </strong></h2>

Some political scientists posited this was because Americans saw international affairs as distant events that didn’t affect their daily lives; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Almond#Almond%E2%80%93Lippmann_consensus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a> believed it was because the public didn’t know enough about foreign policy to react intelligently to it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Americans’ overwhelming response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine seems to fly in the face of that belief. Instead, it’s consistent with <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.111605.105008?journalCode=polisci" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more recent research</a> that citizens not only have opinions on foreign policy, but also assess their leaders based on it. It turns out, research suggests, that not all foreign-policy issues are created equal: Most Americans may not concern themselves with day-to-day international relations, but acute international crises often do grab their attention.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060406.214132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002701045005006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a>, one thing that can make Americans care more about foreign affairs is heavy media coverage of a given issue. And the media is heavily covering the war in Ukraine right now. According to <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=Ukraine&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20220101000000&amp;edt=20220228235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fcs=comb&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;fdt=-05%3A00&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed-captioning data</a> from the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Television News Archive</a>, from Feb. 22-28, the three major cable-news networks (CNN, Fox News and MSNBC) mentioned Ukraine in an average of 2,478 15-second clips per day.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran a search of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC coverage from Jan. 1 to Feb. 28 in the Television News Archive using the GDELT Television API. In that database, daily news footage is split into 15-second clips, and searches return the clips that contain a mention of our search query (“Ukraine”). The cutoff for measuring coverage for any given day is midnight Eastern Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> On Feb. 24, the day after Russia started its invasion,<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia actually started to invade early on the morning of Feb. 24 in Ukraine, but it was still late on Feb. 23 in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> Ukraine was mentioned in a whopping 3,095 clips. To put this in perspective, during January, the word “COVID” was mentioned in an average of <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=COVID&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20220101000000&amp;edt=20220228235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fcs=comb&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;fdt=-05%3A00&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 482 clips per day</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Heck, on Election Day 2020, former President Donald Trump was mentioned by name in <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=trump&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20201101000000&amp;edt=20201108235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fcs=comb&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;fdt=-05%3A00&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 2,675 clips</a>. In other words, Ukraine is utterly dominating the news.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Americans say they’re watching. According to a <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/2/dfp_ukraine_a_toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 25-27 poll</a> from Data for Progress, 63 percent of likely voters said they have read or heard a lot about Russia invading Ukraine. And a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/two-five-americans-approve-president-biden-handling-russia-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 28-March 1 poll</a> from Ipsos/Reuters found that 85 percent of adults said they were either very or somewhat familiar with the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And just as political science would predict, all that coverage is making Americans prioritize the issue. In a <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-74-percent-of-americans-call-russias-ukraine-invasion-unjustified-142128676.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Yahoo News poll</a> from Feb. 24-27, 86 percent of adults said the situation with Russia and Ukraine was either very or somewhat important. Of course, it’s easy to say an issue is important in the abstract, but even when respondents were asked to choose only one issue to be President Biden’s top priority, Russia and Ukraine came in first place with 23 percent (though it was tied with inflation). </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/russia-waging-war-ukraine-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-83167916</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, 58 percent of adults polled by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-biden-state-of-the-union-opinion-poll-2022-02-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/CBS News</a> on Feb. 24-28 said Russia’s invasion matters a lot to the interests of the U.S. And among Americans who planned to watch or listen to the State of the Union, more respondents (73 percent) said it was important for Biden to talk about Russia and Ukraine in his address than said so about any other issue, including the economy (67 percent), inflation (61 percent) and the coronavirus pandemic (52 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In sum, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/foreign-policy-doesnt-usually-affect-elections-could-iran-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first question we often have</a> when there is major news abroad — will Americans care about this? — has been answered. The public is clearly reacting strongly to the war. But that raises a second question: Will the crisis then affect how Americans feel about their president?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Immediately after Russia’s invasion, <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/596030-biden-shows-decisive-leadership-on-ukraine-itll-get-tougher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some commentators</a> speculated that Biden could experience a surge in his job-approval ratings as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally-’round-the-flag effect</a>, or the tendency for presidents to get more popular in times of war. But so far, that hasn’t happened. According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight average</a>, Biden ended March 3 with a 41.6 percent approval rating, one of the lowest numbers of his presidency. There is no sign of a rally even in polls conducted entirely after Russia’s invasion: For example, Ipsos/Reuters gave him a 43/54 approval/disapproval spread, little changed from his 43/53 rating in their pre-invasion poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t surprising when you consider the actual mechanisms behind the rally-’round-the-flag effect. Political scientists have offered <a href="https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-518" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two causes of the phenomenon</a>: an upswell of patriotism in response to the crisis and a lack of criticism of the president that accompanies the crisis, as opposition politicians either show solidarity with him or keep their mouths shut. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Neither condition is met in the U.S. right now. Sure, Americans are showing a lot of solidarity — but with Ukraine, not their fellow Americans. After all, it has been Ukrainian flags, not American flags, adorning <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/uk-news/add-ukraine-flag-facebook-profile-23235639" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/world/empire-state-building-eiffel-tower-ukraine-russia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prominent buildings</a> over the last few days. According to a <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a17333eb0786935ac112523/t/621ed33945b290698a3910e5/1646187323364/Ukraine+US++02+03+22+F.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 25-28 poll</a> from Canadian consumer-research firm Maru, 89 percent of Americans said they stood with the people of Ukraine against Russia. But since Biden isn’t the president of Ukraine, there’s little reason to expect this would help him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Republicans certainly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-target-biden-blame-over-putins-ukraine-invasion-2022-02-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t holding back</a> from criticizing Biden amid the crisis. The official Twitter account of House Republicans last week <a href="https://twitter.com/HouseGOP/status/1496206645919105031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> a photo of Biden with the caption, “This is what weakness on the world stage looks like.” After the invasion, Sen. Ted Cruz <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ted-cruz-russia-invaded-ukraine-because-of-catastrophic-mistakes-made-by-biden-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Fox News</a>, “The reason Russia has invaded Ukraine is because of catastrophic mistakes made by President Biden.” And Trump himself has <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-wg223arwqz1663" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Biden failed “terribly” in allowing the war to start.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, it takes a lot to trigger a rally-’round-the-flag effect. (Just think about how big a crisis would have to be to get Republicans to stop attacking Biden.) Indeed, <a href="https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-518" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research has shown</a> that international crises, and even small deployments of American troops, historically have given the president only a small boost in the polls, or none at all. Only all-out wars or large-scale terrorist attacks produce the kind of emotional response required for a significant rally-’round-the-flag effect — and of course, Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/politics/us-troops-ukraine-russia-nato/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has pledged</a> that the U.S. will not go to war with Russia over Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Biden’s approval rating could still increase as a result of Ukraine — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-explains-the-bump-in-trumps-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not because of the rally-’round-the-flag effect</a>, but simply because people like what he’s done to address the crisis. Last week, I identified a paradox in the polling on Ukraine: Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-will-americans-grade-bidens-handling-of-the-crisis-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disapproved of Biden’s handling of the situation</a> but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-currently-support-sanctioning-russia-for-invading-ukraine-but-are-reluctant-to-deploy-troops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed with the specific actions he’s taken</a>, like imposing sanctions and not using military force. That’s still the case after the invasion: In the aforementioned YouGov/CBS News poll, 76 percent of adults said the U.S. should place economic sanctions on Russia, and 71 percent thought the U.S. should not send troops to Ukraine. But respondents still disapproved of the way Biden was handling the situation with Russia and Ukraine, 59 percent to 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that, as time wears on, Americans will start to give Biden credit for his popular policies on Ukraine and that those numbers will come into closer alignment. According to Ipsos/Reuters, Biden’s approval/disapproval rating on Ukraine improved from 34/49 before the invasion to 43/47 after it. His State of the Union address on Tuesday could also hasten that along, given that he started the speech by talking about Ukraine (although historically, any boosts presidents have received from State of the Union addresses <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-first-state-of-the-union-might-not-change-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been short-lived</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also possible that the paradox is, in fact, a feature and not a bug. Political science tells us that people <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00602.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn to trusted political elites</a> to tell them what to think about foreign policy. And as long as Republicans keep telling their voters that Biden is mishandling Ukraine — while not opposing (even <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/2/24/22948900/russia-sanctions-democrats-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting</a>!) his actual policy on it — partisan polarization may prevent Biden from reaping any political benefit.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">If a kid isn’t keeping up with peers academically, summer school seems like a no-brainer. Instead of forgetting what they learned during the school year while they’re on vacation for two months, they’re catching up and getting ahead. Which is why it was a surprise when a <a href="https://www.rand.org/education-and-labor/projects/national-summer-learning-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rand Corporation study of summer school programs</a> in five urban school districts<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston; Dallas; Duval County, Fla; Pittsburgh; and Rochester, N.Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> found that this common-sense solution … didn’t really solve the problem. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rand’s study found that summer school offered modest, short-term improvements in math scores at best, but those improvements faded by the fall. Other metrics — performance in language arts, student attendance and overall grades — showed no meaningful link to summer school. “The effects were pretty underwhelming,” said Megan Kuhfeld, a senior research scientist with NWEA, a nonprofit educational testing and research organization.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, summer school programs didn’t deliver on their promises. But some subgroups did benefit: the students who regularly attended the programs that were better at navigating hurdles like student retention. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s perhaps never been so urgent to make educational interventions like summer school work for kids. Two years into the pandemic, children across the nation are behind where they would have been academically if the pandemic hadn’t happened. To help bridge the gap, educational theories will have to adapt to the unique realities of actual kids’ lives and families’ needs. If they don’t, even the best ideas, with tons of evidence behind them, won’t work in the real world.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kids learned plenty during the pandemic, Kuhfeld told me. The problem, she said, is that they aren’t learning as much or as quickly as they were each year before the pandemic. Nationally, third-graders in fall 2021 were, on average, testing significantly below where third-graders were testing in fall 2019 in reading and math. The NWEA assessments showed these declines extended across third-graders through eighth-graders, too.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s judging by their percentile ranking relative to students who were in those grades several years before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

But the slower progression is real, and there are patterns to it. The effects were particularly pronounced among Black, Hispanic and American Indian and Alaska Native students.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1872" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Koerth-learningloss-2-desktop@2x.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Koerth-learningloss-2-desktop@2x.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Koerth-learningloss-2-desktop@2x.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Koerth-learningloss-2-desktop@2x.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="621" height="4881" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Koerth-learningloss-2-mobile@2x.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Koerth-learningloss-2-mobile@2x.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Koerth-learningloss-2-mobile@2x.png?w=621 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Koerth-learningloss-2-mobile@2x.png?w=1242 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In the NWEA data, the median percentile ranks for Black third-graders went down 10 points in reading and 14 points in math. For white third-graders, the median percentile ranks declined by exactly half of that (5 points in reading and 7 in math), while the median percentile ranks for Asian American third-graders fell by 3 points in both subjects. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, there’s evidence of declines in attendance and high school graduation rates, something that could signal a broad sense of emotional disconnection from school. Which, in turn, could help explain slowed learning — or exacerbate it, said Dan Goldhaber, director of the National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Slowed learning during the pandemic doesn’t necessarily mean kids are doomed, however. In fact, other researchers like Torrey Trust, a professor of learning technology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said kids actually learned a lot of things during the pandemic that they might not have learned otherwise. For many, virtual classes meant more time with family, more skills with technology, and for some, even better educational experiences, free from bullying. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other good news: Research shows that the slower progress documented by these test scores should be able to be fixed with small-group tutoring. “It’s not rocket science,” said Thurston Domina, a professor of educational policy and organizational leadership at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “You get the kids in small groups and you can really give them customized instruction and focus on them.” When Matthew Kraft, a professor of education and economics at Brown University, reviewed several <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23328584211042858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meta-analyses of the effectiveness of various educational interventions</a> in 2021, he found that tutoring in small groups had a significantly greater effect on student test scores than changes in class size, longer school days or summer-school-type programs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while it’s relatively simple for researchers to run studies on classrooms or schools and figure out which interventions produce the best results, it’s hard for educators to take those findings and put them to work across America. The evidence doesn’t produce a solution — it just shows you how hard it’s going to be to craft a wide-reaching solution. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Case in point: those summer school studies. One of the biggest factors affecting the overall failure of summer school programs in the Rand analysis was that only around half the kids who attended one year didn’t come back for the next — and some kids didn’t even attend each day the first year. The kids who attended summer school habitually, for both years, did improve their math and language skills in ways that lasted all school year. But that group represented only <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9924.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 35 percent of all the kids</a> involved in the study. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So summer school works just fine — if you can get kids to actually go. And that sets up a whole other set of logistical complications that have to be studied and analyzed and implemented. It takes hiring the right teachers who have the motivation and specific interest in teaching summer school, Kuhfeld said. It also takes long-term dedicated recruitment of kids into the programs. Unlike with regular school, students don’t have to attend summer school, so getting them and their families to choose the programs means you have to build both interest and trust — neither of which is a given. And all of this takes money. “There’s a big gap between what should work in theory and what works in practice,” Kuhfeld said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This kind of effect is depressingly common. When the George W. Bush administration set up a program to compile evidence-based educational resources in 2002, education specialists told me they’d hoped this program — the What Works Clearinghouse — would bridge the gap between academia and classrooms. They envisioned it as a way for teachers to get a better handle on how to use evidence-based interventions in the classroom. “We thought we would punch in third-grade math and get an answer,” said Rachael Gabriel, a professor of literacy education at the University of Connecticut.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it never worked out to be that simple. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many cases, researchers I spoke to found that teachers — the people tasked with educating students and bringing those test scores up — didn’t have much control over which interventions they could use and how. Those decisions were made higher up in the chain of administration. A teacher might want to try something and not be allowed. Or they might be excited to try something that was allowed but not be given the funding or staff or bus transport to make it happen effectively. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Making things work in a classroom is different from making things work in a whole district or a whole state or the whole country. That’s something Domina learned when California’s State Board of Education tried to mandate all eighth-graders to take and be tested on algebra. The idea was very much based on evidence, he said. Studies showed that separating some kids into elite math and others into remedial math served to widen inequality and narrow kids’ futures. Giving kids higher expectations leads them to do better. So expanding access to algebra for all should have reduced test-score gaps between rich and poor, white and Black. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it didn’t. In fact, the opposite happened. Domina sees problems of scale — particularly staffing issues — at the heart of that failure. Offering algebra to everyone meant that schools needed a lot more algebra teachers, and quickly. But there were only so many fully qualified, highly skilled algebra teachers. A lot of kids, particularly the ones in lower-income schools, ended up with teachers who didn’t have as much experience and weren’t as effective at teaching the material, he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That story is particularly poignant now. Small-group tutoring can help students catch up on what they didn’t get a chance to learn during the pandemic. But small-group tutoring takes staff — and schools are one of many industries suffering from staffing shortages. Experts like Kraft are concerned that <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2020/05/21/getting-tutoring-right-to-reduce-covid-19-learning-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schools might create failing tutoring programs</a> by using irregular volunteers or older students in place of dedicated staff. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Much like students, schools themselves aren’t necessarily functioning at a neutral, pre-pandemic state, either. “The biggest trend I’ve seen in the last 6-12 months is that schools are struggling to get the basics down. Staying open is hard,” said Chase Nordengren, the principal research lead for Effective Instructional Strategies at NWEA. He’s seen many cases where federal funds, which otherwise may have been spent on staffing tutoring programs to mitigate learning loss, were spent instead on things like better ventilation, personal protective equipment and substitute teachers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think tutoring is a really promising initiative,” Goldhaber said. “But we have never tried to do tutoring at the scale that we are trying it today.” Because of that, he said, parents should be advocating for real-time evaluation and course-correction to go along with these learning-loss interventions. There should be tools in place to help teachers know when something isn’t working for their specific school and allow them to make the kind of personalized adjustments we know are necessary to make any intervention effective. But that, again, takes resources. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the end, it’s not kids’ pandemic test scores that really make researchers feel gloomy about the future of education. Instead, it’s the way educational systems have been set up to fail those kids. Schools have been running with limited resources and little wiggle room for change for at least the past decade, Domina said. “And now we’ve hit a crisis. And they’re not resilient.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to remember now that it’s over, but the war in Afghanistan was overwhelmingly popular when it began. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Merely a week after Sept. 11, then-president George W. Bush <a href="https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-war-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a joint resolution from Congress authorizing the use of force</a> against those responsible, and the U.S. and British, with international support, began bombing Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces Oct. 7. The American public almost universally approved this rush to war: A Gallup poll <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/208334/support-syria-strikes-rates-low-historical-context.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted soon after found</a> that 90 percent supported the war and only 5 percent opposed it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The circumstances, of course, were very particular: There had been an attack on American soil. When Bush’s war on terror expanded to Iraq in 2003, more Americans questioned the reasoning behind going to war — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7634313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skepticism that turned out to be justified</a> — and there were <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-happened-to-the-antiwar-movement_n_5a860940e4b00bc49f424ecb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile protests</a> against the Bush administration, but still an overwhelming majority supported the effort: About 76 percent approved and 20 percent disapproved, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/208334/support-syria-strikes-rates-low-historical-context.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Gallup</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With time, though, both wars became less popular. A Pew Research Center survey conducted last August, after the U.S. had fully withdrawn from the country, found that a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/31/majority-of-u-s-public-favors-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-biden-criticized-for-his-handling-of-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of Americans supported the decision to leave Afghanistan</a>, even as a plurality thought the Biden administration had handled the withdrawal badly, while a July 2021 Gallup poll found that 47 percent of Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/354182/american-public-opinion-afghanistan-situation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought the war had been a mistake</a>. Many younger Americans had grown up entirely during the war’s 20-year duration and so hadn’t formed an opinion at the war’s inception, while many older Americans had changed their minds as its costs multiplied over time.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/russia-waging-war-ukraine-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-83167916</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Now, as the U.S. faces the question of how involved to be in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we can look back at these experiences of war, still not fully reckoned with, and consider how they might have shifted Americans’ understanding of the role U.S. foreign policy plays around the world. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To begin with, Americans seem more skeptical of more recent wars than those of the past. According to a 2019 YouGov poll, World War II was the most recent war in which a majority of Americans, about two-thirds, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-agree-that-wwii-was-justified-recent-conflicts-are-more-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said the United States’ role was at least “somewhat” justified</a>. Respondents said America’s role was less justified in every subsequent war the pollster asked about, with America’s involvement in Vietnam representing a low point of support, at just 22 percent. But of course, these assessments are made in hindsight, when the costs, successes and failures have been made clear.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few other hints that the American public may be war weary, though. In 2017, Gallup asked Americans whether they approved of the airstrikes the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/4/6/15215132/us-syria-bombing-trump-assad-chemical-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump administration launched against Syria</a> because of its use of chemical weapons; only 50 percent approved, a relatively low number. Sixty percent of Americans had approved of previous actions against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria in 2014, although only 47 percent of Americans approved of actions taken against Libya during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. Before that though, a majority of Americans in Gallup’s polling on the question, which goes back to the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983, supported American military force, especially once the president had taken action. “Americans weren’t really enthusiastic about going into other countries after the other engagements we’ve had recently,” said <a href="https://www.gallup.com/people/100180/jeffrey%20m.-jones,%20ph.d..aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeffrey M. Jones</a>, Gallup’s senior editor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Iraq War may have made a lasting impression on whether the U.S. should attack a country preemptively: In 2020, 65 percent told Gallup that the U.S. shouldn’t attack unless it was attacked first, up from a range of 51 to 57 percent when the question was asked from 2002 to 2006, according to Jones.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also true that Americans support defending their allies against nations they see as threats, according to <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/ccs2021_fpmc_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent survey from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs</a>. “What a lot of people always assume about the American public is that the American public is isolationist, is tired of wars and doesn’t want to get involved in the world, especially not militarily,” said <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/about/staff/dina-smeltz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dina Smeltz</a>, a senior fellow on public opinion and foreign policy at the Chicago Council. But the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq haven’t dulled support for military involvement. “Instead of seeing a shrink back from getting involved, especially when there’s an ally involved, we’ve actually seen somewhat of an increase in support for using the military,” Smeltz said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, Americans broadly back economic sanctions against Russia, but fall short of supporting military action. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BR8Cq98JXoKFaaBmfRD-7Cf_eOqmk8dV/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent CBS/YouGov poll found</a> that 82 percent of Americans were worried that the war could spread to the rest of Europe, but 71 percent were against sending troops. Americans also told CBS/YouGov that they wanted Biden to address the situation in his State of the Union speech Tuesday, even more so than the pandemic and the economy. And Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/us/politics/biden-sotu-transcript.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent over 10 minutes</a> at the beginning of his address on the crisis, saying that the American people stood with Ukraine and promising forceful action against Russia, including continued economic sanctions and creating a Department of Justice task force to pursue action against Russian oligarchs. “But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in the conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine,” he added. “Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Typically, several factors determine the level of American support — whether the nation we’d theoretically be fighting against is seen as a threat to American interests, whether we’re allies with the country we’d be supporting and whether respondents feel the war would be successful with few casualties, Smeltz said. Americans see Russia as a threat and Ukraine as an ally, but it seems that many Americans think a war with Russia would not be quick and easy, which could explain many Americans’ hesitancy over sending troops.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans also typically support actions like diplomacy and air strikes more than sending troops to war. Other factors, like where in the world a conflict is, or which party the sitting president belongs to, don’t register as important in polls, Smeltz said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But whether and how Americans favor U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts aren’t the only lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq. <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/fazal007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanisha Fazal</a>, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, said modern military medicine has also altered how we should calculate the cost of war. More soldiers <a href="https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/65/1/160/5905233?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are surviving battlefield injuries</a>, but they’re coming home wounded. Fazal said that hasn’t changed how most Americans think about sending troops abroad — except for people who are caretakers of those who came home wounded. “They know that they’re going to be paying the cost of war,” she said. </p>]]></description>

			<title>How Racism And Sexism Could Define Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Confirmation Hearings</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Feb. 25, shortly after President Biden’s Supreme Court nominee became public, <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1497218325394374709?s=20&amp;t=JJ9UXZnL7nPRsguZszodzQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted</a> that he expects a “respectful but interesting” hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If history is any guide, Graham’s right about it being interesting — but likely wrong about it being respectful. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s nominee is Ketanji Brown Jackson</a>, the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court. Jackson is highly qualified for the role — she has two Harvard degrees, nearly 10 years of experience as a federal judge and once clerked for Stephen Breyer, the justice she’s been tapped to replace. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But research suggests that despite that stellar résumé, her identity as a Black woman — plus her professional background as a former public defender — means that she’s likely to be described less glowingly, interrupted more frequently and asked more questions about her qualifications than another nominee would be. That means we could be heading for an ugly political spectacle, with Republicans attacking Jackson’s background and grilling her about how race might inform her work.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The vast majority of Supreme Court justices <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/politics/black-woman-scotus-nomination-diversity-what-matters/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been white men</a>. (The first Black man on the court, Thurgood Marshall, was confirmed nearly 55 years ago, and the first woman on the court, Sandra Day O’Connor, was confirmed just over 40 years ago.) So, for that matter, were <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/racial-ethnic-diversity-increases-yet-again-with-the-117th-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vast majority of the senators</a> tasked with deciding whether to confirm those nominees. Perhaps as a result, researchers who study the Supreme Court confirmation process have found that when people of color and women began to be nominated to the high court, they were met with more skepticism — and treated with less courtesy — at their Senate confirmation hearings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Boyd%20Collins%20Ringhand%202018%20-%20Paul%20Collins.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mining a painstakingly assembled database</a> of every transcribed statement made in every Supreme Court hearing held before the Senate Judiciary Committee between 1939 and 2010, political scientists <a href="http://clboyd.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christina Boyd</a> and <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/people/paul-m-collins-jr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Collins Jr.</a> and law professor <a href="http://www.law.uga.edu/profile/lori-ringhand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lori Ringhand</a> found that although the sample size was small, there were noteworthy differences in how women and nonwhite nominees were treated.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their sample, there are three nonwhite nominees (Justices Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor) and four female nominees (Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Elena Kagan). Since the data goes through only 2010, this does not include the confirmation hearings for Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> “We find that female nominees are asked more questions of competence,” Collins said. “We also find that female nominees and nominees of color are interrupted more and described in less stellar terms — words like ‘exceptional’ and ‘outstanding.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Usually, this treatment comes from senators of the party opposite of the president who nominated the justice. The researchers found that female nominees were <a href="https://theconversation.com/interruptions-at-supreme-court-confirmation-hearings-have-been-rising-since-the-1980s-104357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than twice as likely to be interrupted</a> by senators of the opposite party. At some confirmation hearings, senators banter about scheduling or the nominee’s family, but <a href="https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1612&amp;context=aulr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the senators dispense with that earlier</a> for female and minority nominees, which means those candidates are asked more substantive questions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Women and minority nominees <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Boyd%20Collins%20Ringhand%202018%20-%20Paul%20Collins.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also pressed more heavily</a> on their judicial philosophy, which is often a coded way of questioning their competence to serve on the court. And there’s evidence that they are particularly likely to face skeptical queries about their outlook. For instance, during Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s confirmation hearings, the researchers found that nearly 20 percent of the questions asked were about her judicial philosophy — higher than any other nominee in the data except for Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Embedded in those questions is often an assumption that female nominees and nominees of color will be biased — particularly on issues like sex-based discrimination and civil rights. During the 1967 confirmation hearings for Marshall, who would eventually become the first Black justice to serve on the Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/wil-haygoods-showdown-thurgood-marshall-and-the-supreme-court-nomination-that-changed-america.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">senators needled him</a> about recent Supreme Court decisions expanding rights for criminal defendants, heavily implying that they had contributed to rising crime, and targeted his record as a celebrated civil rights attorney, suggesting that he couldn’t apply the law impartially. One southern senator <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=NVZFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAre+you+prejudiced+against+white+people+in+the+South?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yeAkja2Ljl&amp;sig=ACfU3U2VXGikn4ql3kj3VfB8xrGLec6hOg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjq17OfjaP2AhX7knIEHZe1AFEQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CAre%20you%20prejudiced%20against%20white%20people%20in%20the%20South%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked him bluntly</a>, “Are you prejudiced against white people in the South?”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s no reason to think that the appeal of racist dog whistles has diminished over time. The professional and personal experiences that make Jackson an appealing nominee for liberals could easily be weaponized against her by the Republicans on the committee — not just her race and gender, but her career as a public defender and <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/02/profile-of-a-potential-nominee-ketanji-brown-jackson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work on federal sentencing</a>. In January, during confirmation hearings for Andre Mathis, a Black lawyer nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/andre-mathis-blackburn/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican senators tried to make hay</a> out of three traffic tickets — all more than 10 years old — that the nominee had apparently failed to pay, claiming that he had a “rap sheet.” And in a recent hearing for Nina Morrison, a white female lawyer for the Innocence Project who had been nominated to a district-court judgeship in New York, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/17/nina-morrison-nomination-cruz-hawley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican senator argued</a> that Morrison would be more likely to “let more violent criminals go.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other elements of the hearings could be just as much of a no-win situation for Jackson. Republicans may also try to use her credentials against her. <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1497218325394374709?s=20&amp;t=K8HLMk3vUb5q9gyz4lhT6Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graham has already commented</a> that “[t]he Harvard-Yale train to the Supreme Court continues to run unabated.” It’s true that most of the current Supreme Court justices have degrees from Harvard or Yale. And it’s also true that Biden’s Black female judicial appointees <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-bidens-appointees-can-tell-us-about-his-supreme-court-nominee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to have even more highly burnished résumés</a> than his average nominee. But while it’s certainly possible to argue that the court would benefit from more educational and socioeconomic diversity, it’s a new line for Republicans. Trump, for instance, appointed two white men <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/08/politics/supreme-court-elite-harvard-yale-clerks/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who didn’t just attend Harvard and Yale</a> — they also went to the same <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/us/kavanaugh-gorsuch-georgetown-prep.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Washington, D.C., prep school</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-is-reshaping-the-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one expert pointed out</a> in a story I wrote last year, Biden may be leaning toward Black women with unimpeachable résumés in an attempt to mitigate racist criticisms about their qualifications. And it’s hard to imagine that Republicans would be any more likely to fall in line behind Jackson if she didn’t have two degrees from Harvard.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it’s possible that Republicans could turn Jackson’s nomination — which will have no immediate impact on conservatives’ control of the court — into a racist spectacle. That might be red meat for their base of white conservatives since, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-oppose-bidens-promise-to-nominate-the-first-black-woman-to-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as FiveThirtyEight contributor Michael Tesler wrote last month</a>, GOP politics is increasingly energized by fears of anti-white discrimination. Biden’s approach to selecting a nominee makes that only more likely, since he guaranteed that he would select a Black woman. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some research suggests that racist attacks on the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court could mobilize another important political group — Black Democrats. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/descriptive-representation-and-public-support-for-supreme-court-nominees/4044D595EFB6E1EC361314BF3319DB1A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a study published in 2019</a>, Black Democrats are particularly likely to prioritize having Black Supreme Court justices, perhaps because they’ve had so little representation on the court throughout its history. There’s evidence that Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s contentious confirmation hearing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-kavanaugh-helping-republicans-midterm-chances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted Republicans in the lead-up</a> to the 2018 midterms. It’s not inconceivable that the same thing could happen for Democrats in November, depending on what happens next.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the meantime, the bleak reality is that Jackson could be in for a very tough confirmation process. But as a Black woman lawyer who’s risen to the height of her profession in spite of all the obstacles in her way, she’s probably pretty well prepared to deal with it.</p>
