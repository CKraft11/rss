			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">This year’s State of the Union will be — believe it or not — the first since the beginning of the pandemic in the United States. And unlike last year’s speech (which was technically a speech to a joint session of Congress, not a State of the Union), attendance will not be capped this year and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/535-members-congress-invited-bidens-state-union-address/story?id=82981127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all members of Congress are invited</a>, though guests still aren’t allowed. With both Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and President Biden’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic Supreme Court pick in Ketanji Brown Jackson</a>, this year’s event is sure to cover a lot of important ground. But as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-state-of-the-union-doesnt-have-a-big-political-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve long documented at FiveThirtyEight</a>, the State of the Union (capitalized title and all) is more symbolic than anything else.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Biden’s speech will still be an opportunity for him to introduce his legislative priorities to the public and to Congress. While the war in Ukraine <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/28/biden-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is poised to overshadow things</a>, Biden will also surely talk about domestic policy matters, such as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/ukraine-presents-biden-challenge-ahead-his-state-union-address-n1289895" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19, inflation and the economy</a>. But simply being a topic included in the State of the Union is no guarantee that Congress will act. From 1965 to 2020, political scientists Donna Hoffman and Alison Howard, who <a href="https://www.dominican.edu/news/news-listing/state-union" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track presidents’ policy requests</a> in State of the Union addresses, found that only 25 percent of requests presidents made of Congress were completely successful. Another 14 percent were partially successful, but a whopping 62 percent were entirely unsuccessful. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, as you can see in the chart below, some presidents have been more successful than others in getting their speech’s agenda through Congress. The number of requests has varied by president, too. Former President Bill Clinton made by far the most requests on average (57 per speech), including the most requests in one address (87 in 2000), whereas former President Jimmy Carter averaged around 16 requests per speech.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Presidents' requests have scattered success with Congress" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EZdqr/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="600" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Congress also isn’t acting on as many presidential requests as it once did. The share of requests fully enacted by Congress peaked in the first year we have data for — in 1965, under former President Lyndon Johnson. And it’s mostly been downhill ever since, especially in recent years as Congress has <a href="https://www.axios.com/congress-legislation-covid-19-2020-28a81b79-8cfc-4fc6-8fa6-e1758dd5f81f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled to pass all kinds of legislation,</a> thanks to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-congress-stopped-working" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing political polarization and gridlock</a>. The share of unsuccessful requests has steadily grown, and former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump each had one year where Congress didn’t pass a single piece of their State of the Union agenda. It’s possible, too, that Biden won’t risk overpromising ahead of what’s expected to be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tough midterm election for Democrats</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of how many requests he makes of Congress, Biden will probably be addressing a heavily Democratic audience. The audience for a president’s State of the Union is usually skewed toward the president’s party, as you can see in the chart below. Consider, too, that in Trump’s last State of the Union, 61 percent of Republicans said that <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/02/03/state-of-the-union-2020-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they planned to watch</a>, whereas majorities of independents and Democrats said they didn’t plan to. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Partisanship drives State of the Union viewership" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uFDxs/16/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that few people will tune in tonight. About 27 million people watched Biden’s joint address last year, which was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-state-of-the-union-address-arts-and-entertainment-government-and-politics-b17d3b474c509d91bd97bf5bbc2f256f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the lowest rating</a> for a State of the Union or joint address since Nielsen, a research firm, started tracking viewership numbers in 1993. (This viewership is especially meager when compared with Biden’s predecessor, who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-donald-trump-hacked-the-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often dominated media coverage</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s say the audience tonight is small and already friendly toward the president. That’s not ideal for making up ground with the public at large. Indeed, that’s what Gallup’s polling of presidents’ approval ratings shows as well. Because Gallup’s polling goes back decades, we can look at presidential approval ratings before and after a president’s speech, and what we’ve found is little to no improvement in a president’s approval rating. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">State of the Union addresses coincided with an average improvement of just 0.4 percentage points, and a median change of 0 points. In fact, a president’s approval rating is just as likely to go down as it is up after an address (the average movement in any direction is 2.6 points).</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, there have been some big swings in presidents’ approval ratings following the State of the Union. Consider Clinton’s 1998 speech. At the time, he was mired in scandal because he had lied to the country about the sexual nature of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a then-24-year-old White House intern. But <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/opinions/state-of-the-union-donald-trump-bill-clinton-1998-avlon/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after a measured State of the Union speech</a> that never mentioned the scandal, but instead touted bipartisan accomplishments like a national budget surplus, he gained 10 points in his approval rating. Likewise, in 2019, Trump’s approval rating had fallen to 37 percent largely because he had just <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/government-shutdown-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overseen the longest government shutdown</a> in history. But similar to Clinton, Trump tried to tout a bipartisan message, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/4-takeaways-from-trumps-2019-state-of-the-union" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasizing cooperation and unity</a> on issues like infrastructure and cancer research, and afterward, his approval ratings recovered to his usual low 40s.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s circumstances are different, but like Clinton and Trump, his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating is quite low</a>, so the State of the Union could be a much-needed popularity boost for Biden. At the very least, it will be an opportunity for Biden to once again outline how he plans to handle <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/politics/us-troops-ukraine-russia-nato/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>, an issue that Americans so far <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-will-americans-grade-bidens-handling-of-the-crisis-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t graded him too highly on</a>. And given the audience will likely lean heavily Democratic, it may even be a chance for Biden to rebuild his standing with Democrats whose views of him <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-have-been-souring-on-biden-since-last-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been faltering since last summer</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As is true for every president, the State of the Union is one of Biden’s best opportunities to tout his administration’s achievements, detail a plan for his administration in the upcoming months and communicate as directly to the public as he can. But ultimately, it’s the 500-some legislators in Congress who will be responsible for passing or not passing most of his agenda — and their minds probably won’t be swayed by a speech.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Where Ohio Republicans’ Attacks On Dr. Fauci Came From</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This is the latest edition of </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/say-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>our column</em></a><em> that excavates the origins of public figures’ extreme comments. We explain what their claims are referring to, the evidence (or lack thereof) behind them and where they sprang from in the first place.</em><em></em></p>



<h2><strong>Who said what …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race for the Republican nomination for Senate in Ohio is hotly contested, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/27/path-ahead-gop-runs-through-ohio-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closely watched</a> and full of candidates who more or less believe the same things — including that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s chief medical adviser, is a bad dude.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Each of the leading Republican candidates in Ohio’s Senate race have piled on the top doc throughout the campaign. Josh Mandel, a former state treasurer, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshmandelohio/status/1424560420128542720?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted last year</a> that the founding fathers would have “tarred and feathered Dr. Fauci.” Former Ohio GOP chair Jane Timken <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/577955-timken-rolls-out-six-figure-ad-campaign-hits-fauci-in-ad?rl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out a six-figure ad campaign</a> where she proposed to “fire Fauci.” Mike Gibbons, an investment banker, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MikeGibbonsOH/photos/a.471671659878827/1451800795199237/?type=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has called</a> Fauci a “liar” whose “credibility is shot.” And “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance has called Fauci <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/30/marjorie-taylor-greene-rallies-crowd-j-d-vance-ohio-senate-race/9252491002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tyrant</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1490030328525869058/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledged to reduce</a> Fauci’s salary to zero dollars and <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1435232117869490183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused him</a> of committing perjury. And while the Republican pile-on of Fauci goes <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/political/gov-ron-desantis-sells-spoof-fauci-can-pound-sand-flip-flops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond Ohio</a> — in fact, there was <a href="https://cpac.conservative.org/full-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of speeches</a> under the title “Fire Fauci” at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 26 — it’s a recent case study that shows just how popular the hate for Fauci is on the right.</p>



<h2><strong>Some background …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The COVID-19 pandemic thrust Fauci into the spotlight in an unprecedented way, and amid the partisan conflict over how best to handle the pandemic, he became <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/04/fauci-attacks-personal-conspiratorial-491896" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a target for right-wing critics</a> who blamed him for both the Trump and Biden administrations’ pandemic responses. These attacks preceded a change in public trust of Fauci. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In April 2021, the <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/confidence-declines-in-cdc-and-dr-anthony-fauci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annenberg Public Policy Center</a> at the University of Pennsylvania found that 71 percent of Americans said they were confident Fauci was providing trustworthy advice on COVID-19, with 47 percent of Republicans saying so. By January 2022, 65 percent of Americans said they were confident in Fauci, while just 36 percent of Republicans did. </p>



<h2><strong>Where the comment came from …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The most obvious source of the attacks on Fauci is the soured relationship between him and former President Donald Trump, who have a long, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/28/president-donald-trump-anthony-fauci-timeline-relationship-coronavirus-pandemic/3718797001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-documented history of conflict</a>. Being anti-Fauci is an easy proxy for politicians and candidates to convey that they are pro-Trump and anti-mandates (vaccine, mask or otherwise). And given GOP voters’ waning trust in the doctor, dunking on Fauci is an easy win for Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But whether or not they realize it, they’re also taking advantage of simmering conspiracy theories on the far right. Take, for example, Vance’s claims that Fauci perjured himself when he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/18/fact-checking-senator-paul-dr-fauci-flap-over-wuhan-lab-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Congress the National Institutes of Health</a> does not fund gain-of-function research — research where an <a href="https://www.virology.ws/2021/09/09/gain-of-function-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organism, such as a virus, is altered</a> to give it a new property or to enhance an existing one — at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Fauci made this statement, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/09/covid-origins-gain-of-function-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Intercept obtained internal documents&lt;/a&gt; about research the NIH funded that some experts argue meets the definition of gain-of-function, though it &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/09/1044985/shi-zhengli-covid-lab-leak-wuhan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;remains a matter of scientific debate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> Such a claim taps into a layered conspiracy theory that COVID-19 was intentionally created at the WIV. While the possibility of an accidental lab leak is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/10/13/1045647249/who-covid-investigation-china-wuhan-lab-leak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still being investigated</a>, there is so far no evidence the virus was created on purpose. On top of that, some conspiracy theorists believe it was intentionally created <em>by</em> the NIH, under Fauci’s direction, to facilitate the need for vaccines, which the conspiracists believe either kill you, give you AIDS, are the mark of the beast or play into various other colorful fantasies. These conspiracy theorists believe Fauci is a satanist, a member of the “deep state” and a pedophile who is responsible for the entire pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“IF we ever get the truth (bahahahahaha) we’ll find Fauci gave us AIDS, HEP C, certain CANCERS and other diseases,” wrote a user in a QAnon chat group on the messaging app Telegram, on Feb. 3. “So the Satanic forces in OUR Government is responsible for MILLIONS of deaths.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[F]auci created AIDS to kill the homosexual community he created the MRNA vaccine to depopulate the world steal our children and get his adrenonachrome,” another user posted in the same Telegram chat, on Feb. 1, referring to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-the-dark-virality-of-a-hollywood-blood-harvesting-conspiracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the conspiracy theory</a> that elites torture children to elicit a fear response in the children’s bodies, thus creating a chemical called adrenochrome, which the elites then harvest and consume to become immortal. (The theory, so far as we can tell, is false.) “Trump learned about this and changed the vax to kill the population of the elite everyone who dies of covid after having the vax is of satanic bloodlines everyone else will get sick from it but should survive[.]”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, neither Vance nor the other Ohio candidates have explicitly advanced these specific conspiracy theories, but the attacks on Fauci are red meat for individuals who believe them. The more vague and overarching the criticism of Fauci — such as calling him a “liar” or calling for him to be fired without specifying why he deserves to lose his job — the more easily they can be transposed onto the wildest conspiracy theories the internet has to offer.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Texas has found itself making headlines pretty frequently these days. Last fall, it dominated much of the news cycle with back-to-back stories about the state’s heavily <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-congressional-map-could-give-a-huge-boost-to-gop-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gerrymandered congressional map</a>, coupled with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stringent abortion law</a>. And, just last week, the governor made headlines after he announced an order that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/science/texas-abbott-transgender-child-abuse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would effectively penalize</a> people who provide gender-affirming medical care to transgender children, in addition to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/02/23/greg-abbott-gender-affirming-care-child-abuse-directive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classifying gender-affirming care as child abuse</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But now, the Lone Star State has another reason to stay in the limelight: After months of campaigning and prognostisticating, Texas’s primary <a href="https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2022/texas-2022-election-ballot-primary/?_ga=2.218788825.1111587308.1641394127-124119358.1641394127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Election Day is finally (almost) here</a>. Texas is not only the first state to hold its primary election this year, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/36-states-are-electing-governors-this-year-here-are-the-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s also one of 36 states</a> hosting a gubernatorial race in 2022. And — to no one’s surprise — former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2022/01/30/418018/donald-trump-endorses-texas-republicans-at-conroe-rally-ahead-of-march-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t shied away from endorsing</a> a number of Republican candidates in the traditionally red state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, there’s a lot to keep an eye out for, but here are the five main threads we’ll be tracking as results trickle in tomorrow evening: </p>



<h2><strong>Can Abbott beat opponents on his right flank? </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is running for what on paper should be an <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/06/greg-abbott-2022-primary-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy third term</a>: He has a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/01/greg-abbott-beto-orourke-fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colossal war chest</a>, the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/01/texas-greg-abbott-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement of the Republican Party’s</a> current kingmaker (Trump), and an incumbency advantage. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, there are a few wrinkles in his plans for reelection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For starters, he has a handful of Republican opponents on his right flank. And Abbott’s <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/04/allen-west-greg-abbott-texas-governor-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two most formidable challengers</a> — former Texas GOP Chairman Allen West and former state Sen. Don Huffines — have arguably <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/23/texas-primary-governor-don-huffines-allen-west-greg-abbott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed the governor further right</a>, forcing him to confront questions about whether he’s the right fit to lead Texas. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/texas-worst-gerrymander-country-fivethirtyeight-83120405</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the last two presidential elections</a>, Texas has inched toward Democrats, but this hasn’t stopped Abbott from signing a number of <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/15/abbott-critical-race-theory-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/09/20/texas-state-politics-shifts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illiberal</a> bills into law since 2020 that restrict everything from what is taught in the classroom to the manner in which Texans can vote. Yet this might not be enough for some conservatives in the state. The Texas Tribune reported in February that some Republican voters have begun to question whether Abbott has <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/03/texas-republicans-abbott-primary-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">done enough to deliver</a> on his initial campaign promises. And if that wasn’t enough to cast doubt on Abbott’s reelection chances, it’s possible that a local man challenging Abbott <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/12/13/rick-perry-texas-governor-springtown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named Rick Perry</a> — no, not the state’s former governor — will distract voters on the ballot who mistake him for the wrong person.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s arguably more working <em>in </em>Abbott’s favor, though. Since late last year, he’s led in every reputable, public statewide poll we could find that measured him against his Republican opponents — and by wide margins, too. According to an October 2021 <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/05/texas-poll-greg-abbott-beto-orourke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas/Texas Tribune</a> poll, 58 percent of the state’s Republican voters said that Abbott would get their vote for governor. West, meanwhile, netted 12 percent of the vote, while Huffines received 7 percent. Chad Prather, a conservative commentator, earned 4 percent. And since then, Abbott’s standing among voters has only improved. Per a January and February <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zD7C_I4RR6loXEZMaJDouNOi0IpeAFBC/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas/Texas Politics Project</a> statewide survey, Abbott led all<em> </em>of his Republican challengers with 60 percent of the vote. No other Republican — including West, Huffines, Prather or Perry — received more than 15 percent of the vote among likely GOP primary voters. Moreover, in a recent <a href="https://www.uttyler.edu/politicalscience/files/dmn-uttyler-jan2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Tyler/Dallas Morning News</a> survey, a majority of Republicans indicated they like the way Abbott is handling his job as governor. Per the survey, 80 percent of Republicans said they either “strongly approve” or “approve” of how Abbott is doing his job. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond the Republican primary, all eyes on the Democratic side will be on former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, who entered the gubernatorial primary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/15/beto-orourke-texas-governor-greg-abbott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a splash last fall</a>. Given O’Rourke’s initial <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/18/beto-orourke-fundraising-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising haul</a>, high name recognition and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zD7C_I4RR6loXEZMaJDouNOi0IpeAFBC/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling advantage</a>, winning the Democratic nomination should be an easy feat. But in 2018, the last time O’Rourke ran a statewide race in Texas, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/03/08/texas-primary-democrat-beto-orourke-confronts-hispanic-surname-advanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he fell short of expectations</a> during the Democratic primary — especially around the state’s border area counties. Plus, the dynamics this time around are much different: In the past four years, O’Rourke has run in — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-most-candidates-dont-run-again-after-losing-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and lost</a> — two high-profile races. And during his presidential run, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/12/politics/beto-orourke-hell-yes-take-ar-15-ak-47/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he took controversial stances</a> that could hurt his political standing in Texas. O’Rourke’s run for governor still tests a somewhat interesting proposition, however: Can a politician whose <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/02/11/beto-orourke-supporters-texas-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shine has dulled considerably</a> over the last few years salvage his reputation enough to not only clear the Democratic field — something that is still <a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/opinion/2022/01/21/cristina-tzintzun-ramirez-column-how-can-beto-orourke-flip-texas-young-voters-color/6599184001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an open question</a> — but <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/01/greg-abbott-beto-orourke-fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also win a general election</a> in a state that hasn’t elected a Democrat to a <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2012/sep/26/texas-democrats-have-lost-statewide-elections-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statewide office since 1994</a>? </p>



<h2><strong>Can Trump save Paxton from a runoff?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we’ve documented previously, Trump has issued a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of endorsements</a> for this year’s midterm primaries — including <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Donald-Trump-Texas-endorsements-16782422.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 20 Republicans</a> in Texas. For the most part, many of these statements of support have gone to sitting members of Congress (with a few notable exceptions). There is one race, however, where Trump’s endorsement will really be put to the test. In the race for attorney general, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/01/12/tracker-attorney-general-ken-paxton-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embattled incumbent</a> Ken Paxton (who is<em> </em><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/26/trump-endorses-paxton-500804" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed by Trump</a>) faces a number of challengers that could make his reelection bid more difficult. Arguing he’s unfit for office <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/the-republican-race-for-attorney-general-will-be-the-weirdest-wildest-and-most-telling-texas-election-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to his ethical and legal baggage</a>, there are three Republicans challenging Paxton this year: Land Commissioner George P. Bush, former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and Rep. Louie Gohmert (who, for what it’s worth, is one of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/22/politics/louie-gohmert-texas-attorney-general-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiercest Trump supporters</a> on Capitol Hill).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Paxton has <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1496476595124641795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest war chest</a>, according to various reports, polls suggest a close race among the four Republicans, and it’s not clear whether Paxton can make it through tomorrow without avoiding a runoff (a reality <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1493235635909500932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even he’s acknowledged</a>.)<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If no candidate in a Texas primary receives at least 50 percent of the vote, plus at least one additional vote, the top two vote-getters advance to a head-to-head runoff election &lt;a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/important-election-dates.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;on May 24&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> Per a February <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2022/02/20/texas-gov-greg-abbott-up-7-points-over-beto-orourke-ag-ken-paxton-likely-headed-to-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Tyler/Dallas Morning News</a> poll, Paxton led Bush, 39 percent to 25 percent. Guzman landed in third with 13 percent of the vote, while Gohmert netted 7 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump, of course, is no stranger to butting into competitive elections and calling out Republicans he deems insufficiently loyal to him, especially those who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democracy-is-on-the-ballot-in-these-11-secretary-of-state-and-attorney-general-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t vocally accepted</a> his false claims that the 2020 election was unfairly stolen from him. What’s interesting in this race, however, is that <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/07/27/trump-rewards-texas-ag-ken-paxton-key-endorsement-gop-primary/5388330001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paxton</a> isn’t <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/louie-gohmert-ken-paxton-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the only Republican</a> to have the former president’s back. So, it’ll be especially interesting to see whether Trump’s endorsement is enough to save the incumbent from a runoff. And while we shouldn’t put too much stock in Trump’s standing in the GOP based on the results of just <em>one</em> Texas race, remember: The former president already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-special-election-in-texass-6th-district-will-test-trumps-influence-on-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a small setback last year</a> when Republican Susan Wright — his choice candidate for a special election in Texas’s 6th Congressional District — narrowly lost her race in July to Rep. Jake Ellzey.</p>



<h2><strong>Who will win control of Texas’s newest districts? </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thanks to Texas’s population growth over the last decade, the state gained two additional congressional seats — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than any other state</a> — during the reapportionment process. The question now, though, is: Who will win control of these new districts? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As my colleague Geoffrey Skelley and I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-congressional-map-could-give-a-huge-boost-to-gop-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in September</a>, the two new seats (one in Austin’s metropolitan area, another in Houston’s) aren’t that competitive. In fact, following the redistricting process, there’s only one competitive seat left, near the border. This is in large part because legislators made a number of Republican incumbents’ seats even <em>redder</em>,<em> </em>while Democrats were packed into traditionally liberal — or once competitive — enclaves, like Austin and Dallas. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As a result</a>, the newest seat in Austin will be bright blue, while the Houston seat was intentionally drawn so that it’s favorable for a Republican. </p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What’s interesting, though, is that the favorites for both seats are household names in Texas political circles: In Austin, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a 27-year incumbent who <a href="https://twitter.com/LloydDoggettTX/status/1456278167132442631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the backing</a> of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is largely seen as the front-runner for the seat adjacent to Texas’s capital. He <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/17/lloyd-doggett-austin-congress-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced the decision in October</a> to run in the newly created 37th District versus his current 35th District which, thanks to new redistricting lines, now runs through San Antonio. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Houston, Republican Wesley Hunt, who <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-7th-district-house-election-lizzie-fletcher-wesley-hunt-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made national headlines</a> during his race against Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher in 2020, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/26/texas-new-congressional-seats-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also favored</a> to win the GOP primary in Texas’s new 38th District. Beyond his <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/01/27/amid-jim-crow-2-0-rhetoric-some-gop-candidates-of-color-thrive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising edge</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1486821642823208963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls</a> also give him the upper hand. And beyond that, he has the support of some <a href="https://wesleyfortexas.com/for-release-wesley-hunt-endorsed-by-senator-ted-cruz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable members of the GOP establishment</a>, like <a href="https://wesleyfortexas.com/for-release-wesley-hunt-endorsed-by-president-donald-j-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> and Sen. Ted Cruz. If both Hunt and Doggett win their respective primaries, they’re both expected to sail through a general election. </p>



<h2><strong>Will Hispanic voters near the border gravitate toward Republicans? </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hispanic voters, on average, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-latinos-really-moved-toward-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to support the Democratic Party</a>. But in 2020, Trump made decisive gains among Hispanic voters living along Texas’s border, winning 14 of the 28 counties there and flipping eight counties from blue to red. Of course, without Trump on the ballot it’s hard to tell just how much Texas’s Hispanic population will continue its rightward shift. But <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/14/ut-poll-march-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting so far</a> suggests that at least Abbott and O’Rourke <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/24/beto-orourke-2022-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are paying close attention</a> to get-out-the-vote efforts in South Texas, especially now that the state’s new redistricting lines make the area <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less competitive for the GOP</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond the marquee governor’s race, Republicans are also determined to flip the 15th District, whose Democratic incumbent, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, <a href="https://www.borderreport.com/news/politics/incumbent-south-texas-congressman-now-running-in-neighboring-border-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to seek reelection in a neighboring district</a> (the 34th District) after redistricting made his original seat more competitive. What’s more, the Republican candidate who gave Gonzalez a surprisingly close race in 2020, Monica De La Cruz, <a href="https://myfox8.com/news/republican-challenger-to-run-again-after-narrow-loss-in-texas-border-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is running in the 15th District again</a> and national Republicans, <a href="https://www.monicaforcongress.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Trump</a>, have lined up to support her. The Democratic primary in that district, on the other hand, has been rather quiet. While a handful of Democrats are running for the seat, arguably <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/01/texas-rio-grande-valley-congress-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none have gained quite the amount of traction</a> De La Cruz has.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s at least one other border-area congressional primary that’s drawn national attention in recent months, too: the rematch between Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and progressive Jessica Cisneros, a <a href="https://jessicacisnerosforcongress.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human rights lawyer</a>, in the 28th District. In 2020, Cuellar narrowly <a href="https://www.tpr.org/news/2020-03-04/henry-cuellar-narrowly-defeats-jessica-cisneros-in-tx-28-democratic-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eked out a win</a>, but his odds this time around are less certain. While Cueller has <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1488264795014844416" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incumbency on his side</a>, his home and campaign office were raided last month, as he is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/feds-issue-subpoenas-seeking-records-related-rep-cuellar/story?id=82405832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly under federal investigation</a> for connections he might have to companies or organizations connected to Azerbaijan. (In reviewing subpoenas associated with the investigation, ABC News found that many subjects had ties to the former Soviet Republic.) Cisneros, meanwhile, has the backing of <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/j-street-jessica-cisneros-progressive-primary-texas_n_620af758e4b0ccfb3e59a71d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable fundraisers</a> and congressional progressives, like New York Rep. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/alexdria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-jessica-cisneros-henry-cuellar-1299514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> and Sen. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/politics/bernie-sanders-jessica-cisneros-henry-cuellar-texas-primary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernie Sanders</a>. She has also attempted to focus her campaign on <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/23/south-texas-star-left-progressive-00010774" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local issues impacting the district</a> versus <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/democrats-losing-texas-latinos-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national progressive talking points</a> that pundits (<a href="https://www.axios.com/cuellar-progressive-policy-south-texas-trump-biden-c3c1bab4-cbbf-422f-b4b9-524d98889a8b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Cuellar</a>) previously warned might turn off Hispanic voters in the state. Still, beyond the FBI’s reported probe into Cuellar, this race could, once again, serve as a litmus test to how far left Hispanic voters living in the district are willing to go. Cuellar so far has <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/05/jessica-cisneros-henry-cuellar-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned as a moderate</a> with more experience, but it’s unclear whether that’ll be enough to overcome a potential scandal. </p>



<h2><strong>How will new voting laws affect turnout? </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas is one of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 21 states</a> that enacted a new voting law since the 2020 election. But even before these latest restrictions, it was hard to vote in Texas: According to the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/elj.2020.0666" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost of voting index</a>, which evaluates state voting guidelines in their entirety, Texas in 2020 had the most restrictive electoral climate in the country. Taken together, that leaves a big question mark over how things like voting by mail, registering to vote and in-person voting will impact this year’s races. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The law, which among other provisions <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/01/texas-voting-bill-greg-abbott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires absentee voters to provide specific information</a> about their Social Security or driver’s license numbers on their absentee-ballot application and gives more power to partisan poll watchers, is already creating some <a href="https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2022/02/election-officials-say-texas-new-id-rules-for-voting-by-mail-could-cause-more-ballots-to-get-rejected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new barriers for voters and election administrators</a>, too. In some of the state’s biggest counties, like Harris and Tarrant, many Texans deemed eligible to vote by mail initially <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/24/texas-vote-by-mail-rejections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw their mail-in ballot applications rejected</a> due to new — and more strict — proof of identity requirements. Moreover, according to recent reports, some mail-in applications <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/politics/texas-voting-law-issues/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were submitted to the wrong office</a>, which local officials said derailed the process of getting mail-in ballots to the right people in time. Other issues, like <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/politics/texas-voter-registration-card-shortage/285-31662e47-f067-49db-9bce-6739c41ef427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a shortage of voter registration forms</a> have plagued the state, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s difficult to say with any certainty how many people might not vote as a result of Texas’s law (the state <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/14/texas-primary-voting-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is already known</a> for its historically low voter turnout). But <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/14/texas-primary-voting-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early voting numbers</a> so far suggest that a number of voters are sitting out this year’s races — likely due to the voting law, a lack of enthusiasm or, probably, a mixture of both.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will have far more serious repercussions around the world than on U.S. domestic politics. We at FiveThirtyEight are experts on the latter, though, so here’s a look at how the conflict might affect President Biden’s political standing. (With war breaking out only this week, it’s too early to say anything for sure, so consider this a scene-setter of sorts.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, Biden starts off this crisis with low marks from the American public on foreign policy. In five polls conducted this month,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/390086/biden-ratings-economy-foreign-affairs-russia-near.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt; (Feb. 1-17), &lt;a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3835" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Quinnipiac University&lt;/a&gt; (Feb. 10-14), &lt;a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/americas-role-in-the-russia-and-ukraine-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research&lt;/a&gt; (Feb. 18-21), &lt;a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/23/voters-divided-biden-foreign-policy-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Morning Consult/Politico&lt;/a&gt; (Feb. 19-21) and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-president-biden-not-tough-russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; (Feb. 19-22). The first three polls surveyed adults, while the last two surveyed registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> between 52 percent and 58 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Biden’s handling of foreign policy; only 35-44 percent said they approved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those numbers, however, were likely a hangover from <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/taliban-afghanistan-79496986" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August</a>, when the last American troops started withdrawing from Afghanistan and the Taliban retook control of the nation two weeks before the U.S. evacuation was complete, exacerbating a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/afghanistan-faces-humanitarian-crisis-taliban-takes-control-79521011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humanitarian crisis</a>. Americans were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-end-of-the-afghanistan-war-and-bidens-handling-of-it-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with how Biden handled that situation</a>, and his approval ratings on foreign policy have not moved much since then. For example, Biden’s approval/disapproval rating on foreign policy in an Aug. 28-30 <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/23/voters-divided-biden-foreign-policy-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> poll was 37/52 — exactly where it was last weekend.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Views of how Biden is handling the Ukraine-Russia crisis weren’t that different. According to a Feb. 18-21 poll from <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/americas-role-in-the-russia-and-ukraine-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>, Americans disapproved of Biden’s handling of “the U.S. relationship with Russia” by 56 percent to 43 percent. Meanwhile, a Feb. 1-17 <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/390086/biden-ratings-economy-foreign-affairs-russia-near.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> poll found that Americans disapproved of his handling of “the situation with Russia” by 55 percent to 36 percent. And in a Feb. 10-14 <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3835" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a> poll, Americans disapproved of his handling of “tensions between Russia and Ukraine” by 54 percent to 34 percent. These figures were all within a few points of his approval numbers on foreign policy more generally in those polls. (In addition, a Feb. 19-22 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-president-biden-not-tough-russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> poll found that 56 percent of registered voters thought Biden had not been tough enough on Russia, virtually identical to the share who disapproved of his foreign-policy performance.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These numbers were also within a few points of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his <em>overall</em> approval rating</a>, suggesting that Americans may not yet know how to judge Biden on the crisis and have simply retreated to their partisan corners when answering this question. That’s consistent with findings from political science research that Americans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/26/will-foreign-policy-be-a-major-issue-in-the-2016-election-heres-what-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t have strongly held opinions on foreign policy</a> and <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00602.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look to signals from political elites</a> to tell them how they should feel about it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, a separate <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/24/ukraine-polling-sanctions-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> survey conducted Thursday — the only poll asking about Ukraine conducted entirely since Russia’s invasion so far — told a different tale. In it, registered voters gave Biden a positive net approval rating on his handling of foreign policy in Ukraine and Eastern Europe: 48 percent to 43 percent. This could reflect what will happen to Biden’s approval ratings on Ukraine (and perhaps overall) once the public hears more about the crisis and has new information on which to base their opinions — such as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/24/1082776912/biden-russia-ukraine-invasion-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s televised announcement on Thursday</a> that he would impose harsh economic sanctions on Russia and not send U.S. troops to Ukraine. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-currently-support-sanctioning-russia-for-invading-ukraine-but-are-reluctant-to-deploy-troops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As my colleague Geoffrey Skelley wrote at the time</a>, both of those positions are popular among the public.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the crisis could have potential downsides for Biden too. One of the biggest vulnerabilities for him could be if the conflict disrupts oil exports from Russia, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/02/23/gas-prices-rising-russia-ukraine/6912371001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading to higher gasoline prices</a> in the U.S. According to the Morning Consult/Politico poll, 58 percent of registered voters would hold Biden very or somewhat responsible if gasoline prices increased as a result of the conflict; only 28 percent would hold him not too or not at all responsible. (This may be why, in his speech to the nation on Thursday, Biden said he would <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/02/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-russias-unprovoked-and-unjustified-attack-on-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve</a> and “do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.”)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also unlikely that Biden’s approval rating will increase as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally-’round-the-flag effect</a>, or the tendency for presidents’ popularity to surge in times of war or international emergencies. This bump is hardly automatic: Historically, it’s been highly dependent on <a href="https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-518" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposition politicians’ refraining from criticism of the president</a> during times of crisis. But in this era of hyperpartisanship and -polarization, it’s unlikely that Republicans will lay off Biden anytime soon. In fact, Republicans such as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/gop-finds-consensus-russia-criticizing-biden-n1289598" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ted-cruz-russia-invaded-ukraine-because-of-catastrophic-mistakes-made-by-biden-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Ted Cruz</a> have already blamed the Russian invasion on Biden’s “<a href="https://twitter.com/HouseGOP/status/1496206645919105031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weak</a>” leadership.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For now, though, this is all speculation. A wide range of outcomes are still possible. Ukraine could dominate the headlines for the next several months — or some other major event could take place and overshadow it. U.S. involvement in the conflict could prove to be minimal — or the nation could end up getting dragged into war (a lot of this, of course, depends on what Russian President Vladimir Putin does, which is even less predictable). And Biden could prove a deft negotiator of the situation — or he could bungle it. We say this a lot at FiveThirtyEight, but it is especially true in this circumstance: We’re just going to have to wait to see what happens.</p>]]></description>

			<title>The GOP Is Still Largely Skeptical Of Putin — For Now</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Shortly after news broke that Russia had launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine, a Telegram channel operated by a user known as “<a href="https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/a-qanon-couple-is-behind-the-for-god-and-country-patriot-roundup-at-dallas-hotels-12003194" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAnon John</a>” posted a photo of former President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and posed a question to its more than 80,000 followers: Do you trust Putin? In the hundreds of comments below the question, his followers replied with “yes” after “yes.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Throughout the building tensions in Ukraine over the past few weeks, the messaging from Republican leaders has been consistent: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-republican-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blame Biden</a>, but don’t praise Putin. And the majority of Republican voters don’t trust the Russian president, according to polls taken prior to the invasion. But there have been notable exceptions to this response in recent days, including former President Trump, Fox News host Tucker Carlson and online conspiracy theories among the far right — all of which may shift Republican rank-and-file views as the conflict continues. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polling over the last few weeks has found Republicans, like most Americans, don’t trust Putin. In an <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/w6rek2s6zg/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted Jan. 22-25, 15 percent of Republicans said they had a very or somewhat favorable view of Putin, similar to the 11 percent of Americans overall who said so. A plurality of Republicans (45 percent) said they had a very unfavorable view of the Russian leader. In a <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/22150612/2202139_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico poll from last week</a>, more Democrats (20 percent) said they strongly or somewhat approved of how Putin was handling the conflict in Ukraine than did Republicans (10 percent). And when asked in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-u-s-involvement-opinion-poll-02-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a CBS News/YouGov poll</a> conducted Feb. 8-11 whether the U.S. should support Ukraine, support Russia or neither, only 4 percent of Republicans said “support Russia” (in line with the 5 percent of Democrats who said the same). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that hasn’t stopped influential figures on the right from taking a friendlier position on Putin. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.clayandbuck.com/president-trump-with-cb-from-mar-a-lago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump appeared on a conservative radio show</a> and called Putin “smart,” “savvy” and a “peacekeeper.” Even after news broke of the invasion on Wednesday night, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rti1j0b7xw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump called the attack</a> “sad” but also defended Putin, saying, “I really don’t believe he wanted to do this initially. I think he wanted to do something and negotiate it. It just got worse and worse.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fox News host Tucker Carlson struck a similar tone <a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1496302694088257539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on his Tuesday-night broadcast</a>, telling his audience to ask themselves why they hate Putin. “It might be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious: What is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years?” The answer to all these questions, Tucker noted, is “no.” However, Carlson changed his tune slightly after Russia invaded, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/02/25/tucker-carlson-russia-ukraine-putin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying on Thursday</a> that “Vladimir Putin started this war,” which he called a “tragedy.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This contrarianism has been noticed by Russian state media, <a href="https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/02/24/donald-trump-and-tucker-carlson-are-all-over-russian-state-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which has been running clips</a> of Trump, Carlson and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in recent days.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In right-wing spaces online, the conversations following Russia’s attack mirrored these two responses. On the pro-Trump message board Patriots.win, posts and memes focused on criticizing and mocking Biden and Democrats but steered clear of actually praising Putin for his actions. Many took an isolationist stance instead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The more I hear about this, the more I wonder why we should care,” one user wrote in a popular comment on a highly active thread that day.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Fuck the Great Reset. Fuck puppet Xiden.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some on the right use this portmanteau of Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping as a reference to what they perceive as the Chinese Community Party’s influence on Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> And fuck Russian AND Ukraine. I WANT MY ‘AMERICA FIRST’ AGENDA &amp; PRESIDENT BACK,” wrote another, capturing a sentiment shared by many on the forum. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But among QAnon and other conspiracy-theory communities, like the channel created by QAnon John, praise for Putin was easier to come by. This is because a prevailing theory among QAnon followers is that Putin invaded Ukraine to flush out a supposed “deep-state cabal,” which the followers baselessly allege runs the world and is involved in Satan-worship and child sex trafficking. Many interpreted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/24/putin-denazify-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a line from Putin’s speech</a> Thursday where he pledged to “denazify” Ukraine as code for taking out the deep state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“What does Putin mean by the denazifying of Ukraine?” one user asked in a Telegram chat group Thursday. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Get rid of the Deep State players,” another user replied. “It’s happening all over the world.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many QAnon followers were also promoting a conspiracy theory about Russia targeting secret U.S. biolabs located in Ukraine that study deadly viruses. The claim that the U.S. has secret biolabs in Ukraine <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/02/24/us-biolabs-ukraine-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is false</a> and has been <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/sbu-no-us-biological-laboratories-in-ukraine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed by Russian propagandists</a> for years. A tweet thread that was retweeted more than 1,700 times before Twitter suspended the account (though it has since been shared on Telegram and TikTok), expanded on that conspiracy theory, claiming the sites of reported air strikes correlated with the sites of clandestine, U.S.-owned biolabs. QAnon followers later claimed that Twitter’s suspension of the account proved the theory was true.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Must be on to something if they were suspended,” a user posted on the QAnon message board GreatAwakening.win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling and the messaging of most Republican leaders show a mostly unified front against Putin, albeit with disagreement over the best way to respond to Russia’s assault on Ukraine. But the mixed messaging from influential sources like Trump, Carlson and the QAnon community threaten to chip away at that resolve. Clearly, some Americans already believe that Putin may not be the bad guy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Take note of every single ‘elite’ person screeching about Putin and Russia in defense of Ukraine right now,” QAnon influencer IET 17 wrote on Thursday, to his more than 90,000 followers on Telegram. “They’re the enemy.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Feb. 25, 2022, 1:20 p.m.):</strong> An earlier version of this article incorrectly spelled the first name of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">After several weeks of mild suspense, President Biden announced that he’s nominating Ketanji Brown Jackson, who currently sits on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court. Now, the Senate is hurtling toward its fourth Supreme Court confirmation hearing in five years. Jackson, who is the first Black woman ever to be nominated to the court, has support from <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/liberals-circle-wagons-around-ketanji-214027021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several progressive groups</a>. If she’s confirmed, she’ll probably move the court’s Democratic-appointed bloc even further to the left – although it’s not clear from the data we have just how liberal she’ll be. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jackson’s nomination is historic — she’s poised to become the first Black woman and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/11/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-defender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first former public defender</a> to serve on the nation’s highest court. But unlike with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-amy-coney-barrett-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the previous</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-brett-kavanaugh-would-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two battles</a> over potential justices, the ideological balance of the court isn’t about to change. Jackson, if confirmed, will replace another justice nominated by a Democrat, which means the court will still be dominated by a six-justice conservative majority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that doesn’t mean Jackson’s worldview won’t matter if she ends up on the Supreme Court – after all, she’s likely to serve for decades. Based on her professional background and her previous rulings, she’s likely to be a more liberal justice than Breyer was, and one who will probably be less willing than Breyer to compromise with the court’s conservatives. That could mean the court – like every other political institution these days – is about to become even more polarized.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Predicting how potential justices will rule when they get their Supreme Court robes is a tricky business. According to one prominent metric of Supreme Court ideology, though, Jackson looks pretty moderate. As the chart below shows, her <a href="https://www.epstein.wustl.edu/jcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judicial Common Space</a> (JCS) score would place her toward the middle of the current Supreme Court, slightly to the right of Justice Elena Kagan and well to the right of Justice Sonia Sotomayor. According to those scores, she’s also a middle-of-the-road judge on the court where she’s currently serving.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="896" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/atd.SCOTUS-NOM.0225-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/atd.SCOTUS-NOM.0225-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/atd.SCOTUS-NOM.0225-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/atd.SCOTUS-NOM.0225-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But there are a lot of reasons to think that the JCS scores underrate Jackson’s liberal tendencies quite a bit. For one thing, a different measure from the <a href="https://data.stanford.edu/dime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Database of Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections (DIME)</a> puts her to the left of Kagan and even Sotomayor. According to this metric, Jackson is actually one of the most liberal judges on the D.C. Circuit.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1000" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/atd.SCOTUS-NOM.0225-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/atd.SCOTUS-NOM.0225-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/atd.SCOTUS-NOM.0225-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/atd.SCOTUS-NOM.0225-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These estimates of Jackson’s ideology are so different, in part, because pinning down a lower court judge’s ideological outlook is even more difficult than figuring out how a Supreme Court justice will rule (which is itself no easy task). The JCS scores are <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60188505fb790b33c3d33a61/t/61f1855081fb31470cda3c37/1643218256396/ReplacingJusticeBreyer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on the idea</a> that the ideology of the politicians who nominate a judge can tell us a lot about how the judge will approach their job, but that means the judge’s own views and rulings aren’t taken into account. And the scores are even less nuanced for judges who serve on courts in Washington, D.C. Usually, JCS scores are based in part on the ideology of a judge’s home-state senators, but since D.C. does not have any senators, those judges’ ideology scores are based entirely on the presidents who nominated them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The DIME scores, on the other hand, are drawn from the judge’s own political contributions. This has its own limitations, especially for judges. Federal judges <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/code-conduct-united-states-judges#:~:text=Canon%205%3A%20A%20Judge%20Should%20Refrain%20from%20Political%20Activity,-(A)%20General%20Prohibitions&amp;text=(3)%20solicit%20funds%20for%2C,a%20political%20organization%20or%20candidate." target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t allowed to donate</a> to campaigns after they join the bench (for Jackson, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/02/profile-of-a-potential-nominee-ketanji-brown-jackson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that happened in 2013</a>), which means this metric can be very dated. For instance, when it comes to the Supreme Court, the DIME scores <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-conservative-supermajority-is-just-beginning-to-flex-its-muscles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t accurately reflect</a> the ideological leanings of Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, two conservatives <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who have been federal judges for decades</a>. But in an era where ideological consistency is an increasingly prized feature in judges, even years-old political contributions could be a pretty good signal for how newer justices will rule.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And there are other clues in Jackson’s record that suggest she’d be likely to join Sotomayor on the court’s left flank, rather than staking out a spot in the middle. In her first opinion for the D.C. Circuit, which came out days after Breyer announced his retirement, Jackson <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-contender-jackson-backs-unions-first-ruling-2022-02-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down a Trump-era policy</a> that had limited the bargaining power of federal unions. Last year, she was also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/appeals-court-rules-against-trump-fight-over-jan-6-committee-n1285700" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of three judges who ruled</a> that former President Donald Trump couldn’t stop presidential documents from being turned over to the House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6. As a district court judge, <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6516-jackson-ruling-in-mcgahn-subpo/92d4672db63b5cac498d/optimized/full.pdf#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she ruled</a> that Trump’s former White House counsel, Don McGahn, had to obey a congressional subpoena to testify. “Presidents are not kings,” she wrote. “This means they do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She’s also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/us/politics/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seen the impact of harsh sentencing policies firsthand</a>. In addition to working as a federal defender, Jackson also spent several years at the U.S. Sentencing Commission, where she was involved in an Obama-era push to make sentencing guidelines for judges less draconian. And one of Jackson’s family members was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/14/1078086453/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught up in the war on drugs directly</a>. Her uncle was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent drug crime under a “three strikes” law. Years later, President Barack Obama commuted his sentence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those life experiences are unusual for federal judges, who have often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-is-reshaping-the-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent their careers as prosecutors or corporate lawyers</a>. <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/harris-sen-public-defenders.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s evidence</a> that criminal defense experience does have an impact on judges’ decision-making; a study found that defendants assigned to a judge with that kind of experience are, on average, less likely to be incarcerated. And although Jackson has never commented publicly on her uncle’s case, it seems possible that watching a family member go through the criminal justice system may have given her different views about issues like sentencing, which come up not infrequently in Supreme Court cases.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the background that makes Jackson appealing to liberals could make her confirmation process even more contentious. Granted, she hasn’t been especially controversial in the past. When she was nominated to the district court in 2012, former Republican Rep. Paul Ryan — <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/potential-supreme-court-nominee-family-house-speaker-paul/story?id=37187861" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who’s a relative of Jackson’s by marriage</a> — testified in her favor. And when she was appointed to the D.C. Circuit last year, three Republican senators — Lisa Murkowski, Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-and-kyrsten-sinema-will-probably-vote-for-bidens-supreme-court-pick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crossed the aisle to vote for her</a>. Graham, however, <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1497218172071645195?s=20&amp;t=x1FsqAM1h7qz2BN-j06c7w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has already indicated</a> that he’ll be taking a very different position on Jackson this time, tweeting that “the radical Left has won President Biden over yet again.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So she’s unlikely to get full-throated support from Republicans this time. The question is how much of a fuss they want to make, considering that no matter how liberal Jackson turns out to be, her confirmation won’t shift the conservative tilt of the court.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 midterm election hasn’t even happened yet, but speculation about the 2024 presidential race is already underway, with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ignore-what-potential-2024-presidential-candidates-say-watch-what-they-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many potential</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/pence-delivers-campaign-speech-schools-2024-speculation-mounts-n1282654" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates positioning</a> themselves <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/04/josh-hawley-2024-465756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for a possible run</a> — and in the case of former President Donald Trump, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/01/trump-arizona-rally-2024-election/621244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing so quite publicly</a>. Early general election polls are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already testing Trump against President Biden</a>, too, with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/22/biden-confirm-2024-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many questioning</a> whether <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/why-biden-wants-you-to-think-hes-running-in-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden will even run again</a> in 2024, when he’d be 81 years old. Some Democrats <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/582071-democrats-question-whether-biden-will-actually-run-in-2024?rl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have even gone as far as to venture</a> that a rough midterm election for their party — which seems quite possible — might discourage Biden from running again, opening the door for Vice President Kamala Harris or another Democrat to win the party’s nomination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while a strong Republican performance in 2022 might influence Biden’s thinking on 2024, it’s a mistake to expect the midterm result to predict how the country will vote in the ensuing presidential election. As the chart below shows, there’s little relationship between the margin in the national popular vote for the U.S. House in a midterm election and the national popular vote margin in the next presidential contest.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.displayr.com/what-is-correlation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;correlation&lt;/a&gt; is a weak -.258 from 1946 to 2020. Of course, there were a handful of presidential cycles with sizable third-party vote shares, such as George Wallace’s &lt;a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1968&amp;amp;f=0&amp;amp;off=0&amp;amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;14 percent in 1968&lt;/a&gt; and Ross Perot’s &lt;a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992&amp;amp;f=0&amp;amp;off=0&amp;amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;19 percent in 1992&lt;/a&gt;, which complicates calculating the presidential vote margin, but even if you exclude those two cases where a third-party candidate won more than 10 percent, there is still little relationship between midterm and presidential results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> So whatever happens in the House this November, don’t expect it to forecast the results of the next presidential race.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1008" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley.POLLAPALOOZA.0225.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley.POLLAPALOOZA.0225.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley.POLLAPALOOZA.0225.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley.POLLAPALOOZA.0225.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">More often than not, midterm and presidential results have been miles apart. For instance, in 1994, the GOP captured Congress in the midterm “<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2007/11/congress-runs-into-republican-revolution-nov-8-1994-006757" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Revolution</a>” amidst then-President Bill Clinton’s <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/1994/1011/11191.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor approval ratings</a>, winning the House popular vote by about 7 percentage points. But in 1996, Clinton ended up claiming a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/23/the-least-important-election-of-our-lives-400075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleepy reelection victory</a> by 8.5 points over Bob Dole — a swing of more than 15 points. In fact, on average, there’s been a swing of about 12 points from the midterm to the subsequent presidential contest.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, midterm elections and their following presidential races have sometimes run close together: Democrats swept back into power in the 2006 midterm election with an 8-point edge in the House vote, for instance, and then-President Barack Obama won by a similar 7-point margin nationally in 2008. In fact, midterm and presidential elections have run closer together in recent years — but importantly, there is still not much of a relationship despite this. Rather, this seems to be happening because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-biden-blowout-didnt-happen-and-why-a-2024-blowout-is-unlikely-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landslide presidential wins</a> are increasingly a thing of the past. Instead, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lopsided midterm results</a> for the party not in the White House are increasingly becoming the norm, then followed by highly competitive presidential races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One big reason midterm and presidential elections have such different outcomes is that they are fundamentally different kinds of contests. Midterm elections, for instance, <a href="http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to have much lower turnout</a> than presidential elections, and what’s more, voters from the party that’s not in the White House are often much <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to turn out</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3365&amp;context=facoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some voters switch</a> from the president’s party because of dissatisfaction with the status quo. And because the president’s party usually loses ground in a midterm, you still often see <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ominous-signs-for-obama-in-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narratives that suggest</a> a president’s reelection chances <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/11/28/republicans-face-indecision-conflict-as-they-assess-1982-election-losses/4f3d86a6-7e8b-497b-8baa-5b7851fca329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may now be in peril</a> just after a midterm election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet presidents can, of course, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2647652" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change their approach</a> following a difficult midterm and/or their <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e234d1aa-d947-11e0-884e-00144feabdc0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opponents in Congress can overstep</a> after winning power, both of which can help improve the president’s public standing. And perhaps most importantly, two years is a lifetime in politics, leaving plenty of time for important factors like the state of the economy or war and peace to change in meaningful ways that will influence the electorate. For instance, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/12/poll-most-see-obama-losing-in-2012-046499" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggling economy</a>, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mediocre approval ratings</a>, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/04/us/reagan-facing-demands-for-compromise-on-economy-after-26-seat-loss-in-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad midterm</a> can become a <a href="https://www.aei.org/economics/again-the-1980s-boom-was-about-more-than-just-the-reagan-tax-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roaring economy</a>, “<a href="https://youtu.be/pUMqic2IcWA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Again In America</a>,” and a <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1984&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landslide victory</a> in that narrow span of time, as was the case for former President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 reelection bid. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given all this, Biden and Democrats who are uncertain about the party’s standing probably shouldn’t look to the 2022 election result as a sign of whether the president can win in 2024. It’s true that the midterm outcome could alter the public’s perception of Washington if Biden is facing off with a GOP-controlled Congress. But the actual midterm results won’t really tell us whether Biden is doomed or can win reelection. After all, we have no idea where things will stand in a couple years when it comes to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-isnt-going-anywhere-and-americans-know-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation and the overall economy</a>, much less sudden developments like the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-currently-support-sanctioning-russia-for-invading-ukraine-but-are-reluctant-to-deploy-troops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S.’s potential role</a> in the conflict in Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, with all this said, it is indeed fun to take a look at the early polling of the 2024 race — trust me, it’s like catnip. Nevertheless, we need to take those early polls with <em>many</em> grains of salt. After all, even polls taken six months out from the general election <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-can-pay-attention-to-those-trump-vs-biden-polls-but-be-cautious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are only moderately predictive of the final result</a> — and at that point, we usually know who the nominees are. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2024 election is likely to be pretty competitive considering how divided our politics are, but the candidates do matter at the margins. So regardless of how many polls test Biden against Trump, time will tell whether we will really see the first general election rematch since 1956 — or if one or both parties end up nominating someone else entirely. But one thing is for certain: The result this November will not guarantee any result for November 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Other polling bites</strong></p>



<ul><li>Russia <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/russia-ukraine/?id=82467772">attacked Ukraine early Thursday morning</a> in a conflict that has already killed dozens. But while Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-currently-support-sanctioning-russia-for-invading-ukraine-but-are-reluctant-to-deploy-troops/">generally support helping Ukraine</a>, they largely oppose military intervention and think the American government should be minimally involved at this point. According to a Feb. 19-20 poll from Morning Consult, 51 percent of <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/22/ukraine-russia-polling-donbas-sanctions-gas-hikes/">registered voters think the U.S. should impose sanctions</a>, while just 19 percent think the U.S. should deploy troops into eastern Ukraine. And with the caveat that this poll doesn’t account for Russia’s recent attacks, support for sanctions has increased 7 percentage points since Morning Consult last asked this question on Feb. 7.</li><li>Amidst ongoing efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/books/book-ban-us-schools.html">ban books from school libraries</a>, and statewide efforts to <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06">restrict how public schools teach race</a>, a Feb. 15-18 poll from CBS News/YouGov found that Americans <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/book-bans-opinion-poll-2022-02-22/">largely oppose efforts to remove books</a> that contain controversial themes from schools. At least 83 percent said books should never be banned for containing political ideas they disagree with, discussions on race, depictions of slavery, or criticisms of historical figures and events from U.S. history. And over three-quarters of respondents, including 63 percent of Republicans and 89 percent of Democrats, said that public schools should be able to teach about ideas and historical events that might make some students uncomfortable.</li><li>Fifty-nine percent of American workers who can do their job from home <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/">are doing so all or most of the time</a>, according to a Jan. 24-30 survey from the Pew Research Center. That marks a 12-percentage-point decline from those who said the same in October 2020, but the share who say they’re <em>choosing</em> to work from home versus those whose workplaces remain closed or unavailable has almost flipped. Back in October 2020, 64 percent worked at home because the office was closed versus 38 percent now, while 36 percent chose to work from home versus 61 percent now.</li><li><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/02/22/covid-health-care-workers-poll-pandemic-burnout/6844789001/">Healthcare workers still report high job satisfaction</a>, but a majority also say they’ve been struggling with burnout. In a Feb. 9-16 poll from USA Today/Ipsos, 80 percent say they are very or somewhat satisfied with their job. Fifty-nine percent say they feel hopeful or motivated to go to work, while 56 percent say they feel optimistic. But 52 percent report feeling burned out, especially younger workers — 61 percent of healthcare workers under 30 felt this way, versus 45 percent of those 50 and older.</li><li>Americans are paying less attention to national news, with the decline <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/articles/americans-attention-to-national-news-lowest-in-four-years/">mostly coming from Democrats</a>, according to a recent Gallup/Knight Foundation report. A poll of 4,221 U.S. adults from Nov. 23-Dec. 3 found that the share who said they pay a great deal of attention to national news (33 percent) was the smallest since the Knight Foundation started tracking that question in April 2018. The biggest drop in attention came from Democrats: Just 34 percent of Democrats said they pay a great deal of attention to national news, versus 69 percent in November 2020. To be sure, though, attention to national news might be down, but it’s still larger than the overall share who say they pay a great deal of attention to local (21 percent) or international news (12 percent).</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Thursday, Russia invaded Ukraine, precipitating the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/politics/us-military-ukraine-russia/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest military conflict in Europe</a> since World War II. In response, President Biden has delivered on his promise to impose <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-vows-consequences-russia-stages-full-scale-attack/story?id=83085065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweeping economic sanctions</a> against Russia, after weeks of saying he would institute severe sanctions against the country in such an event.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear at this point what these sanctions will do to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin in his invasion of Ukraine, but the sanctions issued by the U.S., in partnership with its allies, intend to hobble Russia’s economy by restricting its major banks’ ability to conduct business as well as the country’s overall ability to remain competitive in the global marketplace, including in particular its ability to bolster its military. In his address earlier this afternoon, Biden also reaffirmed financial and humanitarian support for Ukraine and promised that U.S. military forces in Eastern Europe would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/us/politics/biden-russia-sanctions-ukraine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defend America’s NATO allies</a>, but he was adamant in saying that American troops would not fight against Russia in Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s still very early in understanding how the U.S. and its allies will respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but one key factor in how the Biden administration charts its path forward will undoubtedly hinge on <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060406.214132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American people’s receptiveness to U.S. involvement</a> in this conflict. And on that point, recent surveys suggest that Americans are leery of U.S. intervention in Ukraine, especially when it comes to sending American troops. This attitude <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-crisis-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t changed much</a> in the past few weeks, either, even as a Russian invasion became more likely. Americans continue to have strongly negative views of Russia and support imposing strict sanctions that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/will-wests-russia-sanctions-anything-damage-deter-putin-ukraine-rcna17301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could damage the Russian economy</a>, but Americans don’t yet seem ready to support direct U.S. military action.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s little doubt that Americans view Russia as a threat, though. Indeed, 71 percent of Americans told <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/4bmkoc0k8o/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> this week that Russia posed a somewhat or serious threat to the U.S., with 41 percent calling Russia an “immediate and serious” threat — higher than for any other country or group the poll asked about. And in the same survey, 52 percent said it was more important for the U.S. to take a “strong stand” against Russia to prevent it from taking over Ukraine, compared with 24 percent who said it was more important to maintain good relations with Russia. On that question, a majority of both Democrats and Republicans prioritized opposing Russia in the Ukraine situation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Americans don’t support the U.S. becoming seriously involved in the conflict and, at this point, strongly prefer sanctions and other forms of nonmilitary action to hurt Russia and help Ukraine. For instance, an <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/americas-role-in-the-russia-and-ukraine-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP-NORC poll</a> from last week found that 52 percent of Americans wanted the U.S. to have a minor role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, compared with only 26 percent who wanted the U.S. to have a major role (although what “major” and “minor” meant here was left open to interpretation). Meanwhile, that Economist/YouGov survey found that 57 percent of Americans felt that imposing economic sanctions on Russia was a good idea, and a sizable plurality of Americans (45 percent) supported giving Ukraine financial aid. But 55 percent thought it was a bad idea to send troops to Ukraine to fight Russians, and a slight plurality (37 percent) said the same of sending U.S. forces to Ukraine for support but not to fight the Russians.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that Americans <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/22/ukraine-russia-polling-donbas-sanctions-gas-hikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have become even more skeptical</a> of putting troops on the ground now than they were earlier this month. Morning Consult conducted polls on <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/08174124/2202035_crosstabs_GEOPOLITICAL_RISK_UKRAINE_RVs_v2_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 7</a> and <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/22150208/2202127_crosstabs_GEOPOLITICAL_RISK_RVs_v2_CC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 19-20</a> in which they asked registered voters if they preferred imposing sanctions on Russia or sending more U.S. troops to Eastern Europe under a variety of scenarios, ranging from a Russian-backed coup establishing a pro-Russian government in Ukraine to a complete Russian occupation. And across four of the five scenarios Morning Consult asked about, American voters prefered imposing sanctions to military action in both polls, except in the event that Russia invades and occupies all of Ukraine. In early February, respondents were more likely to support sending troops than just imposing sanctions, but by last week, Americans were evenly split. This speaks to a broader trend between Morning Consult’s two polls: The share of registered voters who preferred sanctions rose slightly in its second poll while the share who backed sending more U.S troops to the region shrank.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This doesn’t mean that Americans would necessarily oppose a deployment of American military forces to the region, however. Americans were split, after all, on that worst-case scenario in Morning Consult’s latest polling, and more broadly, The Economist/YouGov found that a plurality (44 percent) of Americans thought it was a good idea to send troops to NATO allied countries in Eastern Europe, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Understanding where American views go from here is difficult, but as images from Ukraine take over the news, and as Biden and other U.S. leaders direct the country’s response to Russia’s invasion, it’s possible American views on Ukraine will change. By its very nature, a military action of this scope creates an incredibly volatile situation, which means it’s hard to understand Americans’ attitudes at this point. But as things change, we will be keeping a close watch on what Americans think about the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Who Gets To Be A ‘Real American’ Has Always Been About Exclusion</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When Sen. Mitch McConnell was asked, last month, about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-failure-to-pass-a-voting-rights-bill-fits-a-pattern-of-failing-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the concerns that people of color</a> have about their voting access in the upcoming midterm elections, he <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/mcconnell-responds-uproar-voter-comments-82405797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded by saying</a>: “The concern is misplaced because if you look at the statistics, African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You could say McConnell’s comment and the way it differentiated between African Americans and Americans was just an inartful phrasing or a slip of the tongue. But it comes as Republicans around the U.S. have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed and enacted laws</a> that make it harder for people to vote, especially voters of color and young voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, whatever he personally intended, McConnell’s “slip of the tongue” was no slip at all: Throughout U.S. history, white people and institutions have sought to define American identity in a way that excludes people of color, and language has been an important tool in that effort. McConnell’s comment fits neatly into that history. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a long history of patriotic rhetoric that equates Americanness with whiteness — a tactic that influences the public’s perceptions of American belonging and who gets political or social power, according to research. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Whatever we typically think of as patriotic language often puts borders in place about who counts and who doesn’t count,” said Lisa A. Flores, a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, and political rhetoric researcher. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Some of us are not even real Americans. We’re suspect, right? And our bodies are a problem to the nation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Much of this language can seem innocent enough in that it doesn’t mention race or ethnicity outright. Think <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/only-20-percent-of-voters-are-real-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“real” or “regular” Americans</a>, the “<a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/07/23/what-is-silent-majority-trump-nixon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silent majority</a>,” “<a href="https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/159782" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take our country back</a>” and “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079816/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make America great again</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That kind of coded language has a long history in U.S. politics. Take, for instance, “take back our country.” The phrase was one of the last things former President Donald Trump uttered in his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speech before the Jan. 6 insurrection.</a> “We’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country,” Trump said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Variations of that phrase were also <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/496747/rise-tea-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a favorite of the tea party</a>, which sprang to life in no small part in reaction to the election of the nation’s first Black president. Former KKK leader David Duke <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fULPlGwjJMA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used the phrase</a> while explaining the purpose of 2017’s “Unite the Right” demonstration in Charlottesville, and <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?22755-1/louisiana-gubernatorial-runoff-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his concession speech</a> after losing the race for Louisiana governor in 1991. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pat Buchanan, who ran a race-baiting campaign for president in 1992, ended his <a href="https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/buchanan-culture-war-speech-speech-text/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">address to the Republican National Convention that year</a> by saying, “We must take back our cities, and take back our culture, and take back our country.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">George Wallace, former Alabama governor and presidential candidate, ran on the slogan “Stand Up For America” in the 1960s. The motto couched <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-channels-george-wallace-racial-appeals-64654653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigns marred by</a> racism, pro-segregation sentiments and Wallace’s love of the “the great Anglo-Saxon Southland.” He was elected to the governor’s office four times.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This kind of rhetoric is powerful because it allows racism to play out right in front of people’s faces, according to Jamaal Muwwakkil, a socio-linguist and Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s left unsaid who exactly the country is being taken back from.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It passively establishes a hierarchy of Americans on the status of authenticity,” said Muwwakkil. “It is based on the user and the listener to fill in those gaps that aren’t stated explicitly with what they understand to be more authentic characteristics of American.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Painting nonwhite, urban, non-Christian Americans as “fake,” illegitimate or not-the-standard American implies that these populations are less worthy of political or social representation, the experts I spoke with said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We start to use language and we don’t even recognize we’re doing it. You’ve got good people all over the country who are using [this] language, and not intending to be racist,” Flores said. “And that’s the most important piece, because they may not even know how much [Americans have] bought into white supremacy as individuals and as a nation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Language like this has been used to implicitly signal white voters, Flores said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“One of the ways that our brains sort of makes sense of the world around us is that we’re really good at detecting patterns,” said Efrén O Pérez, a professor of Political Science and Psychology at UCLA. “Anytime you use language in that way, you’re tapping into the various associations that people might have with categories, with certain ideas, with certain values.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Flores and Pérez note, language — political rhetoric in particular — is an effective tool to activate this exclusionary version of American identity. In “White Identity Politics,” Duke University political scientist Ashley E. Jardina argues that white racial grievances have a more powerful effect on political beliefs when white people perceive themselves as under threat. As Michael Tesler, a FiveThirtyEight contributor and professor of political science at the University of California, Irvine, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-rise-of-white-identity-politics-explains-the-fight-over-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>, that’s “one reason why Trump was so effective in his <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trumps-use-of-white-identity-politics-strategic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many appeals</a> to the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-stephen-miller-capitalize-white-america-s-fear-its-racial-ncna1102081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/us/politics/donald-trump-white-identity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/06/21/donald-trump-is-a-symbol-of-white-identity-politics-in-europe-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical threats</a> that they were supposedly facing.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-trumps-racist-appeals-might-be-less-effective-in-2020-than-they-were-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots of research has found</a> that Trump’s racist and racialized rhetoric in 2016 helped him win support from white voters who had “conservative” views on race, including many who had previously cast a ballot for then-President Barack Obama in 2012.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The rhetoric matters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it matters beyond elections. This type of language both flows from and reinforces a belief among some Americans, particularly white Americans, that national identity is defined, in part, by whiteness, research has found. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-01818-003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2005 paper</a> in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, “American = White?,” looked at six separate studies on the subject. Overall, it found that African Americans and Asian Americans were viewed as being less American than white Americans (Latinos and Hispanics were not featured in this study). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s despite the fact that both African Americans and white Americans were perceived as having strong ties to American culture. African Americans were seen as more related to a “foreign” label than white Americans, and Asian Americans were not merely viewed as foreigners, but were more likely to be excluded from the “American” label altogether. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-05814-011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 study</a> from the same journal found that white Americans reported concerns that the group’s long-standing claim of being “All-American,” and the term’s growing precarity, may create a growing opposition to diversity.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Gains for minority groups somehow represent a loss for some groups of white people,” said Juliet Hooker, a professor of Political Science at Brown University.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, political language and law go hand-in-hand, experts said. Where racism flows, discriminatory laws may follow. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The law was used as a way of defining who’s American and who’s not along racial lines,” said Kevin Johnson, professor of public interest law at the University of California, Davis. “We should remember that our discriminatory history of immigration laws tells us a little bit about what we are as a nation, and we should pay attention to that.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This can be seen in the <a href="https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/exhibitions/artifact/h-r-40-naturalization-bill-march-4-1790#:~:text=This%201790%20act%20set%20the,born%20abroad%20to%20U.S.%20citizens." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1790 Naturalization Act</a>, <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/our-history/overview-of-ins-history/early-american-immigration-policies#:~:text=The%20general%20Immigration%20Act%20of,for%20new%20federal%20enforcement%20authorities." target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1882 Immigration Act</a>, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/immigration/chinese-exclusion-act-1882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act</a> or <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-agrees-review-trump-travel-ban-case/story?id=48279061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s 2017 Muslim ban</a>. The law has continuously been used to identify and delegate who can be considered an American or worthy of representation in the U.S. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, of course, it’s no coincidence that McConnell’s comment came in a conversation about elections, where who counts as a “true” American is most clearly and literally at stake. Throughout American history, laws have been enacted to deny people of color the vote and representation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Several policies during the Reconstruction and Jim Crow era limited Black voters’ access to elections using loopholes in the 15th amendment that was supposed to guarantee voting rights for Black men. Poll taxes, literacy tests, felony disenfranchisement laws and intimidation are just some of the many ways that Black voters were shunned from the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ongoing <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jim-crow-republicans-democrats-odds-voting-rights/story?id=77188460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting efforts and recent voting restrictions</a> have been dubbed the “new Jim Crow” because of their disproportionate impact on voters of color. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roughly 20 states have restricted voting access since the 2020 election, following Trump’s false claim of widespread election fraud, the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/voting-reform/state-voting-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brennan Center for Justice reports</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, you can see these perceptions about who’s a “true” American, and the language that surrounds those beliefs, in Trump’s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They have resulted not only in a majority of Republicans believing the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to polls</a>, but in a myriad of efforts to find fraud (none of which have succeeded). But look at where those efforts focused: According to Hooker they targeted, “ multiracial cities and cities with large Black populations.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea, Hooker added, is that Trump and his supporters lost because of people who, in their view, shouldn’t get a say at all, and certainly shouldn’t be able to determine the outcome of a U.S. election.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">If there’s one thing you know about FiveThirtyEight, it’s that we love polls. But, contrary to popular belief, we don’t usually conduct polls ourselves — we just collect and analyze them.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On rare occasions, we will sponsor a poll to better understand, say, &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-debate-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;who performed best in a debate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;why millions of Americans don’t vote&lt;/a&gt;, but we always do so in service of a story we’re reporting, not the horse-race toplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>8</sup></a> And all the polls we publish can be found in one place: our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling tracker</a>, which we’ve just revamped in preparation for the 2022 midterm elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few other websites aggregate polls, but in our opinion (completely unbiased, of course), the FiveThirtyEight polling tracker is the best. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, it is comprehensive: It lists virtually every public general-election poll for president, Senate, House and governor, virtually every public presidential primary poll, and virtually every public poll of the president’s and vice president’s approval ratings, other important politicians’ favorability ratings,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, we just list former President Donald Trump’s, but we may start tracking favorability ratings for other politicians in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> and finally the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a>, or which party voters would support for Congress if the election were held today. (The only polls we exclude are those that fail to meet <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/polls-policy-and-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our criteria for transparency and methodology</a>, which almost all reliable pollsters easily meet.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Second, the polling tracker is powerful: You can filter all those polls by race, state, quality and more to see the ones you’re most interested in. You can also download our entire public database — thousands upon thousands of polls — to play around with the data yourself.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2340" height="1680" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/projects.fivethirtyeight.com_polls.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/projects.fivethirtyeight.com_polls.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/projects.fivethirtyeight.com_polls.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/projects.fivethirtyeight.com_polls.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Here’s a quick primer to help you get the most out of the new iteration of our polling tracker. As you can see, there are six columns of data for each poll. First are the <strong>dates</strong> when the poll was conducted. By default, the polling tracker orders polls by the last date they were in the field, from newest to oldest. However, you can change this by clicking “Added” under “Sort by Date” in the gray area at the top of the page. This will sort the polls by the date we found and added them to the polling tracker (again, from newest to oldest), which can be useful if you check the page regularly and want to see all the polls that have been added since your last visit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The second column lists the poll’s <strong>sample</strong> — how many and what kind of people were polled. This is important because polls with smaller sample sizes have bigger margins of error, and polls can also yield different results depending on whether they survey adults (“A”), registered voters (“RV”) or likely voters (“LV”).<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, when we don’t know exactly what kind of voters have been surveyed, you’ll see a simple “V” in this column, for “voters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> For more details on how different samples (and other methodological quirks) can affect a poll’s bottom line, check out <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-read-2020-polls-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our guide</a> to being an intelligent consumer of polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The third column lists the <strong>pollster</strong> that conducted the poll, along with (in most cases) a letter grade. That letter grade represents its <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight pollster rating</a> — our assessment of the pollster’s quality based on its historical accuracy and methodology. You can click on the pollster’s name to see its full track record over the years. (If you want to read the poll itself, click on the dates.) When a pollster doesn’t have a letter grade next to its name, it means it doesn’t have a pollster rating — probably because it’s new on the polling scene. And when the pollster’s rating contains a slash (e.g., “A/B”) inside a dotted circle, it means <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/polls-policy-and-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rating is approximate</a>; there just isn’t enough data to give the pollster a more precise rating.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In our forecasts and averages, we consider every scientific poll, no matter how low its pollster rating (though we do give higher-quality polls more weight). But you might be a bit pickier, so the polling tracker gives you the ability to hide lower-quality polls if you want. At the top of the page, you can click and drag the bar under “Filter by Pollster Grade” to filter out polls below a certain grade. (For the purposes of this filter, pollster grades with a slash are rounded up, and pollsters without grades are treated as the equivalent of C+ pollsters.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fourth column contains the poll’s <strong>sponsor</strong>, if any — in other words, who commissioned the poll if not the pollster itself. Sometimes, this is a nonpartisan organization like a media outlet or university. But other times, it’s a partisan actor like a PAC or even a campaign. We’ve marked partisan sponsors with a red, blue or black diamond (hollow for campaigns or official arms of the party, solid for party-affiliated outside groups) to indicate potential bias toward the GOP, Democratic Party or another party, respectively. Take these partisan polls with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grain of salt</a>: They’re often several percentage points too rosy for their party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the fifth column lists the <strong>result</strong> of the poll, and the sixth column lists its <strong>net result</strong>, or margin, for those of us too lazy to do the mental math (hey, no judgment). If you see a black dot next to a candidate’s name here, it means he or she is the incumbent in that race; if you see the word “More” with a little arrow, it means the poll asked about more than two candidates (just click the “More” to reveal the full results). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When you first land on the polling tracker, it shows a <em>lot</em> of poll questions — more than 30,000 if you click the “Show more polls” button at the bottom enough times. (This is not recommended.) But as mentioned, you can filter the polls down to a specific race (for example, only <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate polls</a>), a specific state (for example, only <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls of Nevada</a>) or a specific election (for example, only polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Georgia governor’s race</a>) using the drop-down menus at the top of the page. (Each filter has a specific URL, essentially creating mini polling trackers for each election that you can return to in a single click.) You can also use the search bar to narrow the list down to only polls meeting your own custom criteria, such as polls conducted by a given pollster, paid for by a given sponsor or asking about a given candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The polling tracker lets you do a lot with our huge database of polls, but for some polling nerds, it isn’t enough. Therefore, we also make our data available for download so you can play with it on your own. At the bottom of the polling tracker, you’ll see another drop-down menu that lists all the polling data sets we have available for download, right next to a big ol’ “Download” button. You’ll also see a link to our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/polls-policy-and-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls policy and frequently asked questions</a>, which should be able to answer every question you have about our polling tracker that I haven’t already addressed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The cherry on top is that, in addition to listing every poll in our database, our polling tracker is also a hub for accessing some of our most popular averages that feed off those polls: our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker of President Biden’s approval rating</a>, our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker of Vice President Kamala Harris’s approval rating</a>, our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker of former President Donald Trump’s favorability rating</a> and our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker of generic congressional ballot polls</a>. There are links to these polling averages at the top of the page, of course, but you can also use the drop-down menus to filter down to those specific polls and our charted averages will magically appear. And if you filter down to a specific election and we have a polling average available for that race, it will appear right on this page too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As you can see, we’ve designed the polling tracker to be a one-stop shop for all your polling needs. So, if you plan to follow the polls in 2022 and can bookmark only one website, make it this one.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">No one seems happy about politics these days. A <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/emerging-trends-and-enduring-patterns-in-american-family-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new survey conducted by the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life</a>, which I lead, found that less than half the American public felt optimistic about the country’s future. But there is a fairly stark divide among Americans on this question, with white Americans expressing far more pessimism about our country’s direction than members of other racial groups.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">White evangelicals were the most pessimistic group we surveyed, but I found in follow-up analysis for FiveThirtyEight that there was a notable racial divide among Democrats as well.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes Democratic leaners. Black and white racial demographics includes only respondents who identified as non-Hispanic Black and white, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> More than 6 in 10 Black Democrats (68 percent), and 62 percent of Hispanic Democrats said they were somewhat or very optimistic about the country’s future but white Democrats were much more divided — roughly as many said they felt optimistic (53 percent) as pessimistic (47 percent) about where the United States is headed.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="586" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cox.OPTIMISM-GAP.0223.png" alt="Stacked bar chart showing the share of Democratic and Democrat-leaning Americans who expressed each view about the future of the country, by demographic. 53% of White, non-Hispanic respondents expressed feeling very or somewhat optimistic, while 47% expressed feeling very or somewhat pessimistic. In contrast, 68% of Black, non-Hispanic respondents felt very or somewhat optimistic and 32% felt very or somewhat pessimistic. 62% of Hispanic respondents felt very or somewhat optimistic and 38% felt very or somewhat pessimistic." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cox.OPTIMISM-GAP.0223.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cox.OPTIMISM-GAP.0223.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cox.OPTIMISM-GAP.0223.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Despite feeling somewhat more optimistic overall than Republicans about where the country is headed, Democrats — particularly those who are white and college educated — expressed far higher levels of politically based anxiety than Republicans. What’s odd about this development, though, is that over the past several decades American society has moved to the left. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A greater share of Americans identify as liberals today than at any point in the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388988/political-ideology-steady-conservatives-moderates-tie.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past 30 years or so</a>, according to polling from Gallup, even if they are still significantly outnumbered by self-identified moderates and conservatives. On political issues from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/16/americans-overwhelmingly-say-marijuana-should-be-legal-for-recreational-or-medical-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marijuana legalization</a> to <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/despite-partisan-rancor-despite-partisan-rancor-americans-broadly-support-lgbtq-rights-broadly-support-lgbtq-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ rights</a>, the youngest generation of Americans consistently expresses more liberal positions than the ones preceding it. In fact, in an analysis of 50 years of trend data from the General Social Survey,<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long-running interview survey conducted regularly by the National Opinion Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> sociologist <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/85/4/1009/6458238?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Hout found</a> that the U.S. has primarily moved in a liberal direction. On more than half of the variables included in his analysis, Hout found public opinion moving in a liberal direction, while only 11 percent of measures showed attitudes becoming more conservative, a roughly five to one liberal advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With many once-liberal positions being adopted into the mainstream, such as same-sex marriage, one might expect a feeling of hopefulness among left-leaning voters. So, why is the feeling of doom and gloom so pervasive among many white liberals?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One possible explanation may lie in how white liberals prioritize politics over other types of activities. Certainly, when it comes to religious participation — an activity <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/loneliness-epidemic-how-marriage-religion-and-mobility-explain-the-generation-gap-in-loneliness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly associated</a> with stronger social connections and feelings of personal satisfaction  — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-not-just-young-white-liberals-who-are-leaving-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberals have experienced a precipitous decline</a> over the past few decades. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Gallup data</a>, only 35 percent of liberals belonged to a church or religious congregation in 2020, down from 56 percent in 1998. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Research by my colleague Ryan Streeter also finds that the most politically active among us are <a href="https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2020/03/20/the_lonely_political_crowd_487105.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less engaged in civic and social activities</a>. This group of people leans farther left than the general population. Streeter argues that for some on the left, politics has replaced religious activities and participation in local community efforts. “When our tribal needs are not met in familial and communal association, our ideological associations play a larger role in our lives — and nowhere is ideological community stronger than in politics,” he wrote. But political activism that doesn’t require interacting with others in person and building relationships does not offer the same social return on investment as other types of activism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another possible reason white liberals express political pessimism might have to do with their media diet. Compared to other Americans, white liberals spend much more time consuming political news. Interest in politics <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/07/20/since-trumps-election-increased-attention-to-politics-especially-among-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surged among left-leaning voters</a> after former President Donald Trump’s election in 2016. And a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/24/1-partisanship-and-political-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by the Pew Research Center</a> found that the most liberal Americans, a group that is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/24/appendix-1-typology-group-profiles-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predominantly white</a>, became much more attentive to politics in the wake of Trump’s victory — 67 percent report spending more time following politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Dan Hopkins, a political scientist and University of Pennsylvania and FiveThirtyEight contributor, has argued that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-politics-is-national-because-all-media-is-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationalization of politics</a> has occurred because the media increasingly focuses on national debates. And more than other Democratic-leaning voters, white liberals’ news consumption is strongly skewed toward national politics. Almost four in 10 white liberals report that they follow news about national politics very closely, while only 20 percent say they follow local news as often.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One unfortunate side effect of the hyperfocus on national news is that white liberals sometimes embrace policies that are out-of-step with the communities the policies most affect. For instance, Black and Hispanic Democrats <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more supportive</a> of increasing spending on local policing than white Democrats are. In <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/crime-policing-and-the-racial-divide-on-the-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent poll</a> by the Survey Center on American Life, 71 percent of white liberals said they support cutting funding from police departments and shifting it to social services instead. But Black Americans were more divided. Slightly more than <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/public-places-and-commercial-spaces-how-neighborhood-amenities-foster-trust-and-connection-in-american-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half (53 percent)</a> supported this policy, but 44 percent didn’t. This is not to say that Black and Hispanic Americans don’t think there are problems in how the police treat Black and brown people (<a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-black-americans-police-dd91c883-1b3b-4eba-87e2-726357d108d7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they do</a>), but their feelings on the issue are complex, and they <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/17/21292046/black-people-abolish-defund-dismantle-police-george-floyd-breonna-taylor-black-lives-matter-protest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often support an expanded police presence</a> in their own neighborhoods.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another reason for dispiritedness among white liberals may have to do with the political fights that they engage in. Take the 2020 Senate election in Kentucky. Democratic challenger Amy McGrath raised more than <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2020/12/04/amy-mcgrath-spent-90-million-failed-bid-defeat-mitch-mcconnell/3824451001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$96 million</a> in her bid to oust then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, but in the end, the race was not close — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-kentucky-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McConnell won by nearly 20 percentage points</a>. Beating McConnell, despite <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-a-candidate-in-kentucky-but-can-she-beat-mitch-mcconnell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his tepid approval ratings</a>, was always going to be a long shot, yet many liberals became <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/19/democratic-campaign-donations-spike-after-ruth-bader-ginsburgs-death/5839031002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotionally invested in the race</a>. Perhaps because of the time and energy spent following national politics, a lot of liberal fundraising flows to these <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-actblue-is-trying-to-turn-small-donations-into-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile national campaigns</a> that ultimately have a low probability of success.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not difficult to see how deeper investment in more winnable races might ultimately prove more rewarding.<strong> </strong>This underscores yet another reason why white left-leaning voters may be more pessimistic: How they engage in politics is different from other Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Tufts University, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/political-hobbyists-are-ruining-politics/605212/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued in 2020</a> that college-educated white Americans — a group that has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trended leftward in recent years</a> — tend to engage in politics very differently from Black and Hispanic Americans. In his research, Hersh found that “white people reported spending more time reading, talking, and thinking about politics than black people and Latinos did, but black people and Latinos were twice as likely as white respondents to say that at least some of the time they dedicate to politics is spent volunteering in organizations.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hersh suggested that white, college-educated, left-leaning voters are much more likely to engage in “political hobbyism” than in building coalitions to address social problems. These efforts often require sustained energy and investments, which for many left-leaning hobbyists is likely a less attractive way of participating in politics, though it may prove more effective in the long run.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, consuming so much political news and information warps our perception of the world. Consider that white liberals are far more likely than other Americans to say that politics says a lot about the type of person someone is. <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/socially-distant-how-our-divided-social-networks-explain-our-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2020 survey conducted by the Survey Center on American Life</a> found that 75 percent of white liberals believed that a person’s politics defines who they are, higher than the public overall (64 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This phenomenon may also help explain why the same survey found that white liberals (69 percent) were far more likely than white conservatives (33 percent) to say they would be upset if their child married someone whose views of Trump diverged from their own. Left-leaning singles who are looking for a relationship consistently express <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/24/most-democrats-who-are-looking-for-a-relationship-would-not-consider-dating-a-trump-voter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater reservations</a> about dating across the political divide as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">White liberals are also more likely to argue about politics with strangers. In the same 2020 survey, close to half (44 percent) reported having had a political disagreement with someone they did not know well within the previous 12 months; Americans overall were less likely to quarrel about politics with strangers, with 34 percent reporting they had in the same timeframe. The problem with this, though, is that research shows that thinking the worst about our political opponents makes us miserable. A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study published in 2019</a> said, “People who hold harsher views of their political opposites also tend to report that politics has negative impacts on their lives.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, pessimism about the future isn’t entirely unfounded for liberals. The political balance of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-conservative-6-3-majority-would-reshape-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court has shifted much further to the right</a> during the Trump administration, and the electoral map, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly the Senate</a>, presents ongoing challenges. On the policy front, issues like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/health/climate-anxiety-therapy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change can feel intractable</a>, too, given the political realities of the moment. But political predictions are often wrong. At the start of the 2020 redistricting cycle, for instance, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/04/with-fewer-state-governments-divided-by-party-than-in-years-past-gop-has-edge-in-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many political experts</a> expected <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/23/redistricting-cycle-begin-484510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the GOP to lock in significant gains</a>, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-countless-confusing-sometimes-contradictory-takeaways-of-the-2021-22-redistricting-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this hasn’t materialized so far</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good news for left-leaning voters is that the higher rates of national media consumption may have been largely driven by interest in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/27/attention-to-covid-19-news-increased-slightly-amid-omicron-surge-partisans-differ-in-views-about-the-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news about COVID-19</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/07/20/since-trumps-election-increased-attention-to-politics-especially-among-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a>. With Trump no longer dominating the media landscape, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 case numbers falling</a>, the appetite for national news on the left is likely to change. In fact, <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/articles/americans-attention-to-national-news-lowest-in-four-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new study by the Knight Foundation</a> shows that Democrats are already paying far less attention to national news today than they were just a few months earlier. Taking an interest in politics is an important part of being an engaged citizen, but for liberals, greater participation in local affairs and organizations may ultimately prove more personally rewarding.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">At the height of the pandemic, state officials warned that their governments would need billions of dollars of support to keep their budgets afloat. The federal government responded with huge spending bills, and now states have billions and billions to spend on their politicians’ top priorities — but they’re not all spending the money the same way. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses what states’ spending decisions tell us about partisan divides. They also look at the best way to poll Americans’ satisfaction with their own lives and the direction of the country and delve into public-opinion polling on U.S. involvement in Ukraine.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389375/satisfaction-own-life-five-times-higher.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moment of deep political gloom</a>, having faith in any politician might feel like a dangerous game. But starting with President Biden’s victory in the 2020 election and continuing into his first months in office, polls showed that Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/us/politics/biden-approval-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were starting to feel more hopeful</a>. Vaccinations for COVID-19 <a href="https://qz.com/2100168/the-first-covid-19-vaccine-was-given-one-year-ago-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began to roll out</a> en masse. Case numbers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/05/us/covid-peak-comparison.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started to subside</a>. The first stimulus checks under his administration <a href="https://www.usa.gov/covid-stimulus-checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went out in March</a>, and Biden promised that, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56368328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by July 4</a>, the country would be able to start celebrating its “independence” from the virus. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gimmicky, sure — but Democrats were there for it. A <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/03/11/rel2b-coronavirus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN/SSRS poll</a> conducted in March 2021 found that 82 percent of Democrats had a lot of confidence in Biden’s ability to lead the country out of the pandemic, and 74 percent thought the worst of the pandemic was behind us, <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/01/21/rel1c.-.coronavirus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up from 38 percent</a> in January 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By Biden’s six-month anniversary in office, though, Democrats were starting to feel a lot less certain that Biden could deliver on his big plans and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/20/18631452/joe-biden-2020-presidential-announcement-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promises to return to normalcy</a>. Now, more than a year into his presidency, Biden is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing sliding approval ratings</a> and growing doubt — even among his own supporters — that he can restore the country to where it was pre-pandemic. There was a clear turning point for Democrats, too: the summer of 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, those mere months were a perfect storm for Biden:</p>



<ul><li>He missed his self-imposed July 4 deadline to have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-doubles-vaccine-efforts-missing-july-4th-goal/story?id=78688063">70 percent of Americans vaccinated</a>, and the delta variant of the coronavirus <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2022/omicron-comparison-cases-deaths-hospitalizations/">hospitalized and killed thousands of more Americans</a>.</li><li>His promised withdrawal from Afghanistan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/us/politics/biden-afghanistan-withdrawal.html">was chaotic and much-criticized</a>.</li><li>Inflation and supply-chain issues <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/cpi-report-july-2021.html">worsened</a>, despite officials’ claims <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/investing/inflation-stocks-economy-federal-reserve/index.html">that these issues would be temporary</a>.</li><li>One of Democrats’ big election-reform bills <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-wont-support-sweeping-voting-rights-legislation-now-or-anytime-soon/">failed in Congress</a>.</li><li>And talks of Democrats’ <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/23/sinema-35t-spending-bill-506583">sweeping social spending plan stalled</a>, becoming less certain after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema rejected its price tag.</li></ul>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans, for the most part, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/29/amid-infighting-republicans-unite-bash-joe-bidens-speech/7386489002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had written off</a> Biden as well as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-really-really-dislike-biden-but-its-not-just-about-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Democratic administration</a> well before the summer. But during those months, there was also a noticeable dip in Biden’s approval rating among independents, which sank 12 percentage points between July and September, according to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/23/views-of-biden-and-congressional-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>. Perhaps what’s most striking, though, is that optimism among Biden’s base, Democrats, also started to evaporate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to weekly tracking surveys conducted by YouGov, the president once enjoyed the support of large shares of Democrats. Per a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/lvncclv7qj/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June survey</a>, 53 percent of Democrats classified him as a “very strong” leader. However, that number dropped significantly by early August, when a new <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/gh8y14nnzo/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> survey showed that only 44 percent of Democrats viewed him in the same light. And by mid-September, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/lib6k0abqf/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that number dropped even further, to 37 percent</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It wasn’t just that Democratic voters started to lose confidence in Biden’s strength as a leader, however. During the summer months, YouGov also found that Democrats became less and less likely to believe that he could successfully bring the country together.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Fewer Democrats think Biden can unite the country" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QHhh2/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If we recall how things were a year ago at this time, the vaccines were just being rolled out and there was a tremendous amount of optimism that the end of the pandemic was near,” said <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/political-science/people/faculty-directory/david-hopkins.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Hopkins</a>, a political scientist at Boston College. “That’s the way that the media and Biden portrayed the situation.” But, Hopkins said, the rise of the delta and omicron variants of COVID-19 were an unwelcome surprise that frustrated Americans. “Even though it’s not fair to blame Biden for the mutations of a virus, it does seem that he hasn’t been able to deliver on the ‘better days are ahead’ message he promised everyone a year ago.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Things didn’t improve once fall rolled around, either. In fact, polling suggests that Biden’s standing among all voters — most notably Democrats — got even <em>worse</em><em> </em>as time went on. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By November, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357545/biden-approval-ratings-mostly-underwater.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most polls had</a> Biden’s overall approval rating <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underwater</a>. It wasn’t just that Americans were upset at his handling of the ongoing pandemic or inflation or a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/us/politics/democratic-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stalled legislative agenda</a> — they also became less likely to trust that things would get better under his administration. That lack of satisfaction among Democrats was perhaps most startling, though. According to YouGov, Democrats’ happiness with the new administration continued to fade in the winter months and into this year as well. By January 2022, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-joe-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Pew poll found</a> that Democrats’ confidence in Biden’s ability to handle the pandemic and the economy, as well as other issues like immigration and criminal justice, had fallen substantially since soon after he took office.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The ‘public opinion’ answer is that people aren’t terribly sophisticated about responsibility and blame. If you’re in charge right now and things aren’t going well, things are your fault. I don’t know if voters have a more nuanced view,” said <a href="https://www.jenniferwolak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Wolak</a>, a political scientist at Michigan State University.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Democrats' views about the country's direction are wavering" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xIi4v/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">So why was the summer a turning point for Democrats? The answer isn’t a simple one, and experts warned us that dissatisfaction likely increased little by little as the months passed. But factors like perceptions of the economy had a lot to do with it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The inflation numbers may not have registered with people until later in the year,” Wolak said. “They’re going back to normal more over the summer, traveling more and spending more — that’s when they’re really noticing that all of this demand is pushing the prices up.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, inflation has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been a bugbear</a> for the Biden administration. Inflation is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/10/january-2022-cpi-inflation-rises-7point5percent-over-the-past-year-even-more-than-expected.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at its highest level</a> since 1982, with the cost of products like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/10/new-inflation-data-is-worse-than-expectedheres-what-you-need-to-know.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used vehicles and gas</a> soaring over the past year. But for months last year, Biden’s advisors <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-inflation-temporary-fed-should-do-what-it-deems-necessary-recovery-2021-07-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued that inflation was temporary</a>. Over the previous summer and fall, though, it became clear that it might be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/upshot/jerome-powell-inflation-pivot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more persistent than they had hoped</a>. As a result, consumer sentiment — a metric of how optimistic everyday people feel about the economy — dropped precipitously over the summer.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Consumer confidence was strong — before it fell a lot" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2Yv8l/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">As our colleague Santul Nerkar <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last December</a>, rising inflation is closely tied to drops in presidential approval. In other words, Americans tend to punish presidents when inflation happens — particularly when very visible costs, like gas prices and grocery bills, go up. “One thing that we know very predictably about presidents is that their approval rating is tied to general perceptions of the performance of the national economy and the conditions of the country more generally,” Hopkins said. “If people think we’re in good times, then the president benefits — whether or not the president actually has anything to do with it.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And although pessimism about the economy these days is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-pessimistic-views-on-the-economy-have-little-to-do-with-the-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often tied more to partisanship</a> than actual economic conditions, Republicans weren’t the only ones <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/23/national-economic-ratings-and-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressing concern</a>. YouGov tracking surveys found that even Democrats were feeling more and more anxious, with a shrinking share — particularly over the summer months — saying the economy was getting better and a growing share saying that the economy was getting worse. And experts warned us that those <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-and-republicans-get-wrong-about-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">views of the economy are unlikely to improve</a> unless inflation starts to fall.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Democrats are less optimistic about the economy" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WIk4V/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not just the economy that has Americans worried. Issues such as the ongoing pandemic and numerous failed campaign promises — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-failed-voting-rights-push-is-a-setback-for-democracy-and-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting rights</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/year-george-floyds-killing-congress-agree-police-reform/story?id=80188065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police reform</a> and an <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2021/12/19/scoop-manchin-refused-a-call-from-wh-before-killing-bbb-495521" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded social safety net</a> — have also impacted Biden’s standing among Democrats. According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/views-on-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a>, concern about the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans remained high from July 2021 and into this year; however, this polling suggests those fears increased among Democrats during the delta wave in summer and, again, during the omicron wave in winter. Watching the situation break down in Afghanistan <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-end-of-the-afghanistan-war-and-bidens-handling-of-it-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely played a role</a> in Biden’s standing with voters, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/13/how-bidens-definition-bipartisanship-has-quickly-evolved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned on restoring bipartisanship in America</a> and now, as president, was struggling to deliver — and some Democrats appeared to be souring on him as a result. “Biden sold himself as a pragmatist. His appeal was not one of personal charisma and personal inspiration. He sold himself as the guy who could get the job done that you needed to get done,” Hopkins said. At least for Democratic voters, the first job was defeating Trump, he said, but beyond that, “[Biden] was the guy who knew how to work the system and knew how to work with Congress and how to manage the government, even if he wasn’t someone who was personally inspirational.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A decent amount of Biden’s current predicament is not unique to him, however. Many presidents come in with high expectations they <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/cruel-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t realistically meet</a>, and Biden was facing an especially big challenge <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/26/1068063536/biden-struggles-with-his-image-as-covid-19-proves-difficult-to-stay-ahead-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the pandemic</a>. There are probably things he could have done better — <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rising-cases-omicron-highlight-holes-bidens-covid-strategy-experts-say-2021-12-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experts have criticized</a> his administration’s response to COVID-19, and members of his own team <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-12-17/kamala-harris-in-interview-says-administration-did-not-anticipate-omicron-variant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have admitted they were surprised</a> by the rise of new variants — but the course of the pandemic was always going to be unpredictable, and much of what’s happening is out of his control. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, a more realistic message — something along the lines of “Hey, this pandemic will probably be around for a while regardless of what we do, and it might keep wreaking havoc on our economy, too” — wasn’t likely to endear Biden to Americans both desperate for both a return to life before the COVID-19 pandemic and eager to get former President Donald Trump out of office. Biden may have made things worse for himself by promising to work across the aisle, which was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bipartisanship-in-the-senate-is-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always going to be an uphill battle</a>. Mostly, though, Biden’s current political morass may have been exactly what he signed up for when he took the helm of the country during a global pandemic. To dispel the gloom that’s enveloping some of his supporters, he’ll have to make people feel better about the pandemic and the economy as well as fulfill more campaign promises — which, as the past year has shown, turns out to be <em>much</em> easier said than done.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Biden is just facing a dilemma that has bedeviled pretty much everyone who came before him, especially when you happen to be in office when times are rough and the demands can’t easily be satisfied,” Hopkins told us. “In principle, it would be nice if we kind of, you know, reset ourselves closer to reality. But I wouldn’t expect any president to try to do that, because all they might do is just further disappoint people.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The idea that Americans are tired of the pandemic has become conventional wisdom, with important policy implications. Democratic governors in blue states like New Jersey and California have <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/2/11/22904377/democrat-governors-pandemic-mask-mandates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled back mask mandates</a>, citing the importance of “normalcy.” But is “normal” what Americans really expect? And what does “normal” even mean, anyway?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_013122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent Monmouth University poll</a> found that 70 percent of Americans agreed with the statement, “It’s time we accept that Covid is here to stay and we just need to get on with our lives.” This poll got a lot of attention — it was featured in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/us/politics/covid-restrictions-americans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a><em>, </em><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/592102-large-majority-say-its-time-to-just-accept-covid-19-as-part-of-life-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill</a> and other outlets, and was even discussed in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-americans-exhaustion-with-covid-19-is-shaping-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent episode of FiveThirtyEight’s Politics podcast</a>. It’s not an outlier, either. <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Tables-Wave-103.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Feb. 11-13 poll from Harris</a> found that 71 percent of Americans agreed with the statement, “We will be living with COVID in some form forever.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, most Americans believe COVID-19 will persist into the near (or distant) future, but what that means to people’s daily lives is the subject of much more dissent. That’s because understanding COVID-19 as an ongoing reality means something different to everyone. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For some, it means going back to pre-pandemic life, without mask mandates, vaccine requirements or other public health measures to contain the spread of the virus. But that’s not what it means to most, according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Feb. 4-7 Axios/Ipsos poll</a>, in which just 21 percent of Americans said we should “get back to life as usual with no coronavirus mandates or requirements.” To be sure, 29 percent thought we should move toward that goal with some precautions, while 23 percent wanted to mostly keep precautions in place and 21 percent wanted to increase precautions. Part of the reason opinion is so divided is that Americans are simultaneously ready <em>and</em> not-ready to go back to pre-pandemic life. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vtm70v61hq/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over three-quarters of Americans</a> said they were “ready to return to normal”, according to a Feb. 12-15 poll from The Economist/YouGov. And yet the Axios/Ipsos poll showed that <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-02/Topline_Axios_Ipsos%20W62%20FINAL_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent thought</a> doing so posed a large or moderate risk.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What Americans want regarding COVID-19 is all over the place. And there’s only so much the polls can tell you. For instance, they can’t list <em>every</em> public health response to COVID-19, much less every combination of responses. But polls show that support is shifting more toward individual precautions than toward COVID-19 protections mandated for society at large.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Americans seem to be OK with being more cautious in their personal decisions. That is, they’re more willing to undergo measures like mask-wearing or vaccinations for themselves, though they may not want to institute it as a requirement. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/09/increasing-public-criticism-confusion-over-covid-19-response-in-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Jan. 24-30 poll</a> from the Pew Research Center, 73 percent of Americans were fully vaccinated, but just 58 percent supported requiring proof of vaccination to fly. And Americans were even less supportive of requiring vaccines for the four other activities Pew asked about — attending a sporting event or concert (53 percent), going to college in-person (52 percent), eating inside a restaurant (46 percent) and shopping inside a store (40 percent). In fact, overall support for vaccine mandates may be declining. Americans were 3 to 5 percentage points more supportive of requiring vaccines for these activities when Pew polled about this in August 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for mask mandates is mixed. In the aforementioned Harris poll, 55 percent of Americans <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Tables-Wave-103.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly or somewhat agreed</a> that it was time to lift indoor mask mandates. But the Monmouth poll found that 52 percent supported statewide mask and social-distancing guidelines, though this figure is down from 55 percent in December and from 63 percent in September. Likewise, according to Axios/Ipsos, support for local and statewide mask mandates in all public places <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-02/Topline_Axios_Ipsos%20W62%20FINAL_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to fluctuate inside a somewhat narrow range</a> of 60 percent to 67 percent, with the greatest support roughly correlated to the peaks of the delta and omicron waves. But one thing is clear: Even if Americans <em>are</em> backing mask mandates less, most still say they would wear a mask indoors. The Harris poll also found that 69 percent of Americans were at least somewhat likely to keep wearing masks indoors now that indoor mask mandates were being lifted, and for those living in places with mask mandates, 58 percent said they would continue to occasionally mask up once those requirements were removed, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vtm70v61hq/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to The Economist/YouGov</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason support for vaccine and mask mandates may be falling is that the public simply doesn’t trust the government to handle the pandemic correctly. Approval ratings for hospitals’ and medical centers’ responses to COVID-19 were still very high, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/09/increasing-public-criticism-confusion-over-covid-19-response-in-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Pew</a>, but approval ratings for President Biden, public health officials and elected officials in state and local governments all declined by double digits since March 2020. In fact, Pew found a significant decline in the approval rating for state elected officials, from a high of 70 percent in March 2020 to a low of 46 percent in January 2022. This may be why governors in particular are pushing for a return to normal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pew also found that shifting public health guidelines have led to an increasing share of Americans who feel confused or less confident in public officials’ recommendations. They also just <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996331692/poll-finds-public-health-has-a-trust-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust public health officials less</a> than they used to. After almost two years of dealing with the pandemic, Americans may trust their own decision-making more than guidance from the government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gone, too, are the days of declaring a “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/biden-declares-war-on-covid-t7n5r3hgm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-scale wartime effort</a>” until the virus is “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-covid-fourth-of-july/2021/07/04/13afcc66-dcc2-11eb-9f54-7eee10b5fcd2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanquished</a>.” Instead, there’s more acceptance among Americans that the pandemic is probably here to stay in some form. What this means, though, has been the subject of so much debate that it’s unsurprising that so many Americans are uncertain about what actions should be taken on a broader scale to address the pandemic. Regulating their individual actions — and expressing their discontent — may really be the only thing under their control.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The COVID-19 pandemic has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/great-resignation-may-be-altering-workforce-dynamic-for-good.html">reshaped the workforce</a>, with many workers quitting their jobs to seek other opportunities, but Americans still think employers have the upper hand. According to a Feb. 5-8 poll from The Economist/YouGov, Americans thought that employers had “a great deal” or “a lot” of <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/02/15/who-do-americans-think-has-more-leverage">leverage in the labor market</a> (43 percent), versus workers (20 percent) — even though many Americans (47 percent) believed the pandemic increased the bargaining power of workers. (Another 34 percent said it had no effect and 18 percent said that it increased the power of employers.)</li><li>Health care workers <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/16/health-care-workers-pandemic-response-polling/">give themselves, their coworkers, their employers and hospitals high marks</a> when evaluating their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Jan. 31-Feb. 11 Morning Consult/Axios poll. Eighty-nine percent said they strongly or somewhat approved of how health care workers had handled the pandemic, compared with 83 percent for their coworkers, 79 percent for employers and 78 percent for hospitals. But similar to other Americans, health care workers were dissatisfied with how the pandemic was handled by the Biden administration (just 44 percent approved) and the American public (34 percent approved).</li><li>More Americans are growing dissatisfied with current levels of immigration in the U.S., but that’s because Republican dissatisfaction <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389708/dissatisfaction-immigration-level-rises.aspx">hit a record high of 87 percent</a>, an increase of 32 percentage points from last year, according to a Jan. 3-16 poll from Gallup. That large spike among Republicans is to be expected — immigration is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/">an increasingly partisan issue</a>, and the GOP tends to disagree with how Democratic presidents handle the issue.</li><li>There were also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/02/16/publics-top-priority-for-2022-strengthening-the-nations-economy/">sharp partisan divides</a> surrounding what Americans believe the federal government’s biggest priorities for 2022 should be, according to a Jan. 10-17 survey from the Pew Research Center. The greatest differences were in dealing with climate change (65 percent of Democrats cited this as a top priority, versus 11 percent of Republicans) and COVID-19 (80 percent for Democrats, 35 percent for Republicans). But Americans of all political stripes viewed strengthening the economy as the most important issue overall, with 71 percent saying it should be a top priority (although that is a decline of 9 percentage points from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/01/28/economy-and-covid-19-top-the-publics-policy-agenda-for-2021/">last year</a>).</li><li>Overwhelming majorities of Republicans want a presidential candidate <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-republicans-disloyalty-opinion-poll-02-2022/">who shares former President Trump’s views</a> on policy issues (84 percent), the COVID-19 vaccine (78 percent) and the 2020 election (70 percent), according to a Feb. 8-11 poll from CBS News/YouGov. But their opinion on Trump’s personal conduct is more mixed. Just 54 percent said they want someone who comports themselves similarly to Trump. That said, Republicans still favor Trump running again: 69 percent said he should run again in 2024, with 70 percent of that group saying he would be the best Republican candidate.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">In recent months, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60201752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news reports</a> in the U.K. revealed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson attended parties in government buildings while Britain was in strict COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. His approval rating has now sunk to <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/boris-johnson-approval-rating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 percent</a>, and it’s unclear if he’ll hang on to his leadership position. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politics podcast</a>, two hosts of the British “<a href="https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talking Politics</a>” podcast, <a href="https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/Staff_and_Students/professor-david-runciman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Runciman</a> and <a href="https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/Staff_and_Students/dr-helen-thompson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helen Thompson</a>, discuss why the British public and some members of the Conservative Party have soured on Johnson in a way that American Republicans never soured on President Trump, despite Trump’s numerous scandals. They also reflect on how British and American politics changed during the period when Brexit and Trump dominated the two countries’ news cycles and consider their lasting impact.</p>

			<category>The Big Lie</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The aftermath of the 2020 presidential election was probably most Americans’ introduction to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state who rebuffed then-President Donald Trump’s entreaties to “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/trump-demands-georgia-elections-official-overturn-his-defeat-in-hourlong-call/6MRGK445JNAGHBL2HXLZ3FIVZU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find 11,780 votes</a>” that would allow him to carry the state. Same with Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/08/texas-ken-paxton-election-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a baseless lawsuit</a> to get the Supreme Court to throw out 60 of then-President-elect Biden’s electoral votes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Secretaries of state and state attorneys general have <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2016/10/how-to-rig-election-2016-secretary-of.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always been influential</a> within <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2014/10/ag-order-2014-race-ratings-for-attorney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their own states</a>, but the attempted abuse of these offices to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election has finally awakened the rest of the country to their importance. As a result, campaigns for these offices that flew under the radar in 2014 (when Paxton was first elected) and 2018 (when Raffensperger was) have been thrust into the national spotlight here in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, 27 secretaries of state and 30 attorneys general will be elected nationwide (other states either elect them in other years or don’t elect them at all). And since the secretaries of state and attorneys general who are elected in 2022 will wield power in 2024, this year’s elections could plunge our democracy into further danger if would-be election subverters win them.</p>



<h2><strong>Secretary of state</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the ones who oversee the administration of elections and the certification of results in most states, secretaries of state play a fundamental role in our democracy. And given their discretion to interpret and implement election laws in ways that either make it <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-93094-529536--,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easier</a> or <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2018/10/19/georgia-voter-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder</a> to vote, they’ve already drawn a lot of attention for 2022: Candidates for the office are raising <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/candidates-top-election-posts-fundraising-record-setting-pace/story?id=82199309" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record sums of money</a>, Trump has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personally pushed</a> to install loyalists in three key states, and incumbents who otherwise might have sailed to an uncontroversial reelection are now facing rabid primary challenges.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The list of secretary of state elections to watch starts with <strong>Georgia</strong>, where Raffensperger first faces a tough primary from Rep. Jody Hice. While Raffensperger has made it clear there was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/weve-found-systemic-fraud-overturn-election-georgia-secretary/story?id=74560956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no election fraud in Georgia</a> and that Biden won the state, his challenger Hice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted against the certification</a> of the 2020 election in the House. He also continued to baselessly claim that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/politics/jody-hice-georgia-elections-secretary-of-state-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of thousands of potentially fraudulent votes</a> were cast and that Trump, in fact, carried Georgia. (He didn’t.) Hice isn’t the only election denier in the race, though: Former Alpharetta Mayor David Belle Isle has claimed there were “<a href="https://www.thegeorgiavirtue.com/2022-georgia-election/sos-candidate-launches-video-series-to-look-at-2020-election-irregularities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irregularities</a>” in the 2020 election, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s still early, but Hice looks like the primary front-runner. Through the end of January, he has <a href="http://capitol-beat.org/2022/02/hice-nguyen-leading-battle-for-bucks-in-race-for-georgia-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $1.6 million</a> to Raffensperger’s $597,000 and Belle Isle’s $376,000, and he has the golden ticket in any GOP nomination fight: <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/hice-launches-challenge-to-raffensperger-in-race-for-secretary-of-state/IBLOYKCCNFBOTN5FCSEM5PMBAA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>. But his path to the secretary of state’s office is not clear in this newly minted swing state. Whichever Republican emerges from the primary will then face a tough general election against the well-funded ($1.1 million raised so far) Democratic state Rep. Bee Nguyen in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump and his allies aren’t just targeting their fellow Republicans, though. Democratic secretaries of state who spent the 2020 election cycle expanding voting access are in the crosshairs, too. The most vulnerable Democrat is likely Jocelyn Benson of <strong>Michigan</strong>. And unlike in most states, her Republican challenger will be chosen at a <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/16/michigan-gop-sets-early-convention-declines-vote-hand-count/8149133002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party convention</a>, not a primary, which could lead to a more radical nominee who appeals to party diehards. That’s good news for college professor Kristina Karamo, who has <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/07/donald-trump-backs-michigan-election-critic-secretary-state/5758348001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Karamo became a right-wing celebrity when she claimed she witnessed fraud as a poll watcher in the 2020 election, and she has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/16/politics/kristina-karamo-michigan-secretary-of-state-candidate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">espoused conspiracy theories</a> such as that Trump actually won Michigan and that the Jan. 6 rioters were actually members of antifa. Other Republicans in the race have more conventional resumes for the state’s chief election official: state Rep. Beau LaFave, Chesterfield Township Clerk Cindy Berry and Plainfield Township Clerk Cathleen Postmus. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans are also hoping to flip control of the <strong>Arizona</strong> secretary of state’s office, but there, Democratic incumbent Katie Hobbs isn’t running for reelection, leaving a crowded field of hopefuls to replace her. Former Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes (who used to oversee elections in Arizona’s most populous county) and state House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding are the two Democratic candidates and the only two candidates in the race who have acknowledged Biden’s victory as legitimate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the four Republicans in the race, meanwhile, two have tried to overturn the 2020 election results. State Rep. Shawnna Bolick, for instance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/backers-trumps-false-fraud-claims-seek-control-next-us-elections-2021-09-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed onto a resolution</a> that urged Congress to award Arizona’s Electoral College votes to Trump, and she also <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/06/22/shawnna-bolick-author-of-bill-to-reject-voters-presidential-choice-running-to-be-top-elections-official/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a bill</a> that would have allowed the legislature to revoke the certification of presidential elections in the state,<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill died in committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> although she has argued that she wasn’t part of the “Stop the Steal” movement. Meanwhile, state Rep. Mark Finchem signed onto the same resolution as Bolick and <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/06/02/mark-finchem-was-much-closer-to-the-jan-6-insurrection-than-he-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 insurrection</a>. Finchem, who has <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/09/13/trump-endorses-mark-finchem-arizona-secretary-state-election/8322839002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>, also has ties to the <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-legislators-to-speak-at-qanon-conference-in-las-vegas-11884331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAnon conspiracy theory</a> and has identified as a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republican-state-lawmakers-white-nationalists-rslc-silent_n_5bcd82e4e4b0a8f17eee0a1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member of the Oath Keepers</a>, a far-right anti-government militia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The two other GOP candidates, advertising executive Beau Lane and state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, have <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/blog/ad-agency-exec-beau-lane-joins-gop-primary-for-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined to say</a> whether the 2020 election was illegitimate, but Ugenti-Rita has voted like she thinks it was. She sponsored multiple <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1003/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting</a> <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1485/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictions</a> that passed the legislature last year, and she initially supported an unfounded <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/post-election-audits-are-normal-whats-happening-in-arizona-is-anything-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan audit</a> into the 2020 election results in Maricopa County (although she later <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-gop-ugenti-rita-withdraws-support-audit-calls-botched-2021-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned against it</a>, complaining it had been “botched”). Ugenti-Rita has other baggage as well: A lobbyist has accused her of making <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/02/05/lobbyist-details-harassment-claims-involving-arizona-senator-michelle-ugenti-rita-brian-townsend/4647264002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwanted sexual advances</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Nevada</strong>’s secretary of state post is also open following the retirement of Republican Barbara Cegavske, who was <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2021/04/12/nevada-gop-censures-barbara-cegavske-defending-election-results/7192091002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured by the state GOP</a> for her insistence that the 2020 election was not fraudulent. Trump himself has not yet weighed in on the <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/2020-election-fraud-conspiracy-theories-remain-central-to-many-republican-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP primary here</a>, but if he does, he’ll probably back former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, who wants to conduct an Arizona-style “audit” into Nevada’s results and attended an election-fraud conference put on by businessman and Trump ally Mike Lindell. Another <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/reno-developer-former-state-senator-jesse-haw-to-run-for-secretary-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-funded Republican candidate</a>, former state Sen. Jesse Haw, says on his <a href="https://www.jessehawnv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign website</a> that Nevada’s liberal voting laws “have made it easier to cheat.” However, there is one pro-democracy Republican running: Sparks City Councilman Kristopher Dahir. Dahir has said he does not believe the 2020 election was stolen and has praised Cegavske’s leadership. There’s also a competitive primary on the Democratic side between Cisco Aguilar, a staffer for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and former state Assemblywoman Ellen Spiegel.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are four of the biggest secretary of state races in which democracy is on the line in 2022. But there are a couple of dark-red states where the Republican primary (as the de facto general election) could have huge consequences for democracy as well. The incumbent secretaries of state of both Idaho and Alabama are retiring, and the primaries to replace them have become referenda on the legitimacy of the 2020 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, in <strong>Idaho</strong>, there are three candidates vying to replace outgoing Secretary of State Lawerence Denney. Phil McGrane, who runs elections in Idaho’s biggest county, has said that Idaho’s elections are <a href="https://magicvalley.com/opinion/columnists/malloy-state-s-election-system-is-sound/article_932fc81d-7cc8-5865-b979-77a08af0d689.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally secure</a>. But state Sen. Mary Souza has pointed to “<a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2022/01/24/introducing-each-candidate-who-is-running-secretary-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weaknesses</a>” in Idaho’s election laws, while state Rep. Dorothy Moon last year <a href="https://wendyrogers.org/update-146-legislators-from-38-states-write-a-letter-to-the-american-people-calling-for-a-50-state-audit-decertification-where-appropriate-and-possible-convening-of-the-us-house-of-representatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a letter</a> calling for an “audit” into the election results in all 50 states along with the decertification of the 2020 election if necessary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, the candidates to succeed <strong>Alabama</strong> Secretary of State John Merrill include one experienced election administrator and multiple pro-Trump election deniers. Ed Packard, who worked in the secretary of state’s elections division for more than 24 years, maintains that there is <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/02/spotlight-shines-on-alabama-secretary-of-state-race-as-views-over-2020-election-and-trump-loom-large.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence of widespread voter fraud</a>, whereas state Rep. Wes Allen <a href="https://twitter.com/RepWesAllen/status/1336791872426086403?s=20&amp;t=gy33vMUpIdo2jNAGXdA0UA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> Texas’s lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election and Alabama Auditor Jim Zeigler has said there is “preliminary information” to suggest there were “strange voting returns” in some counties. </p>



<h2><strong>Attorney general</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">They may not be responsible for the administration of elections, but as their states’ “top lawyers,” state attorneys general provide legal advice and representation for government agencies and officials, investigate crimes and otherwise work to ensure that the state’s laws are being enforced. In the past year, this has meant a lot of wading through — and in some cases initiating — claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In total, we’ve identified five attorney general elections in which claims of election fraud have been a significant issue, ranging from Texas, whose <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/texas-sues-georgia-to-try-to-overturn-election-results/EVEDMTX2J5E2DJ3O6FOGMDS7PM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general led the charge</a> to overturn election results, to Wisconsin, where neither Republican candidate has explicitly claimed that Trump won in 2020 but have nonetheless made election fraud a significant part of their platforms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The most controversial state attorney general right now is likely <strong>Texas</strong>’s Ken Paxton, who is mired in election-related disputes as well as two different criminal investigations. As we said at the outset, Texas was at the forefront of attempts to overturn the 2020 election result, in large part thanks to Paxton’s baseless lawsuit to block the results in four states Biden had won. Trump <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/26/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-2022-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Paxton</a> last July, but he’s also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-louie-gohmert-endorse-opponent-texas-attorney-general-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praised Rep. Louie Gohmert</a>, who <a href="https://abc13.com/louie-gohmert-lawsuit-mike-pence-biden-electoral-count/9284409/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed his own lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election</a> and is now challenging Paxton for attorney general. There are two other Republican candidates in this race: George P. Bush, the Texas land commissioner and son of 2016 candidate (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/05/06/477077226/jeb-bush-wont-vote-for-trump-i-cannot-support-his-candidacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/12/jeb-bush-trump-should-stop-tweeting-focus-on-agenda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequent</a> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/26/jeb-bush-warns-trumps-character-may-drag-down-gop-2018-elections/1067795001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/jeb-bush-trump-qanon-praise-dee2dc47-1db1-4d1f-bae9-fa88bff6dd85.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critic</a>) Jeb Bush, and former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Bush is the only candidate to <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/554119-george-p-bush-says-2020-election-wasnt-stolen-but-would-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have rebuffed claims</a> that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump; Guzman hasn’t said anything publicly about it but has said she would welcome <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/21/texas-eva-guzman-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s support</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the scandals Paxton finds himself in — he faces felony charges from <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/06/19/ken-paxton-criminal-case-timeline-texas-attorney-general-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2015 securities fraud case</a> when he was a member of the Texas Legislature and is also the subject of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/criminal-investigations-dallas-ken-paxton-coronavirus-pandemic-crime-3657864db01b3e2525f53f8f523af316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate FBI investigation</a> over allegations that he engaged in bribery and other crimes while attorney general — the most recent polling of the race shows <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/new-poll-shows-tx-ag-paxton-staring-down-runoff-race-abbott-well-ahead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paxton leading the pack, with 47 percent</a> of the vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Kansas</strong>, meanwhile, the attorney general election is wide open after incumbent Derek Schmidt <a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-dwight-eisenhower-kansas-legislation-coronavirus-pandemic-87542690cbd10047f1e557f7eb5ff57f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to run for governor,</a> creating an opening for <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-kansas-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the GOP’s most vocal proponents of election fraud</a>: former Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Notorious for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/19/621304260/judge-tosses-kansas-proof-of-citizenship-voter-law-and-rebukes-sec-of-state-koba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a controversial law</a> he championed as secretary of state that required residents prove their citizenship before registering to vote, Kobach is now mounting his third bid for statewide office despite two previous unsuccessful attempts — he first <a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/political/laura-kelly-topples-kris-kobach-in-kansas-gubernatorial-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in the 2018 gubernatorial race</a> and then lost to <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article244717957.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then-Rep. Roger Marshall in the 2020 Senate GOP primary</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s likely Kobach’s failure to win these recent elections that has attracted competition in this primary, despite his Trump bona fides. (He hasn’t claimed the 2020 election was fraudulent, but <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/12/07/kobach-texas-case-challenges-election-directly-at-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he did write an op-ed in the conservative media outlet Breitbart</a> in support of Paxton’s lawsuit.) Meanwhile, both state Sen. Kellie Warren, who launched her campaign with <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/07/06/kellie-warren-joins-kris-kobach-kansas-attorney-general-race/7872788002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a thinly veiled dig</a> at Kobach, and former prosecutor Tony Mattivi are running against him. Neither Mattivi nor Warren have spoken publicly about whether they dispute the results of the 2020 election, instead focusing more on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-health-senate-elections-election-2020-616fd7663ffd5cfa25b698b7126d98f9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging the Biden administration</a> on issues like vaccine mandates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Idaho</strong>, it’s a question of whether Republican incumbent Lawrence Wasden, who has defended the 2020 election result, will survive a primary challenge. Lawrence broke with <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/529614-18-states-join-texas-case-seeing-to-overturn-biden-win" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a dozen Republican attorneys general</a> when he <a href="https://www.ag.idaho.gov/newsroom/wasden-issues-statement-on-texas-election-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in December 2020</a> that he wouldn’t be joining Texas’s effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election result. That, in turn, precipitated <a href="https://cdapress.com/news/2020/dec/12/coeur-dalene-attorney-art-macomber-considered-atto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a primary challenge</a> from attorney Art Macomber, who said he was inspired to run when Wasden didn’t join the suit; Dennis Boyles, <a href="https://www.idahoednews.org/kevins-blog/wasden-will-seek-re-election-joins-crowded-a-g-s-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another attorney in the state</a>; and <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/11/17/raul-labrador-launches-attorney-general-campaign-appoints-treasurer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Rep. Raúl Labrador</a>, Wasden’s only challenger with any political experience. But all of these challengers likely face a steep climb to the nomination — Wasden is the <a href="https://www.naag.org/attorney-general/lawrence-wasden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longest-serving attorney general</a> in Idaho’s history, having served for nearly 20 years. And with the exception of <a href="https://archive.sos.idaho.gov/ELECT/results/2002/primary/tot_stwd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his first primary in 2002</a>, he’s handily defeated all subsequent opponents by double-digit margins. That said, both Labrador and Macomber <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/12/10/more-than-1-6-million-already-raised-in-idaho-campaigns-for-statewide-offices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have outraised Wasden</a>, which is a favorable sign for their campaigns.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in <strong>Michigan</strong>, it’s another case of a pro-democracy Republican pitted against proponents of the Big Lie in the GOP primary. At this point, however, <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/politics/2022/01/12/poll-dana-nessel-has-edge-in-re-election-bid-for-michigan-ag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling shows</a> incumbent Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel with a small lead over her two main Republican challengers, former Michigan Speaker of the House Tom Leonard and attorney Matt DePerno.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As is true in Michigan’s secretary of state election, GOP convention-goers will <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/09/michigan-gop-plots-shift-statewide-nomination-process-amid-fight-over-future/7915760002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately decide who the nominee</a> is, not primary voters. And if Leonard wins the nomination, the 2022 election will be a rematch of 2018, which Nessel won by just 3 percentage points. He is also the only Republican running who has said <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-attorney-general-nomination-race-could-test-trumps-hold-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there isn’t any evidence</a> that the election results were invalid. DePerno is polling worse against Nessel than Leonard, but it’s close, and his endorsement from <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/16/trump-endorses-michigan-election-challenger-deperno-attorney-general/8371724002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> may sway some delegates. DePerno has also been a vocal proponent of the claim that Trump’s election loss was fraudulent, even <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/07/attorney-accused-of-pushing-false-election-fraud-claims-wants-to-be-michigans-next-attorney-general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filing a lawsuit in Antrim County</a> alleging that the voting machines used in the election were compromised (the suit was ultimately dismissed). Finally, state Rep. Ryan Berman is also running as a Republican who backs the Big Lie — he <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2020/12/10/gop-lawmakers-hide-from-questions-about-trumps-quest-to-overturn-the-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed onto a letter</a> in late 2020 that raised allegations of election fraud and asked for an independent audit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another state that Democrats are defending is <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, where incumbent Democrat Josh Kaul faces two Republican challengers, who haven’t backed the Big Lie but who have still made “election security” a big part of their platforms: Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney and former state Assemblymember Adam Jarchow. Toney, for instance, has tried to build a name for himself as the district attorney who has prosecuted the most cases of election fraud in the state. (Toney has prosecuted <a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-attorney-general-race-could-decide-fate-of-fraud-allegations-against-wisconsin-elections-commissioners/article_0bec141e-2866-5a5d-9f1a-af7cb688172b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven of 10 cases</a>, the most of any Wisconsin district attorney.) Meanwhile, Jarchow <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamforAG/status/1492202669934628873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has attacked Kaul</a> for insufficiently investigating allegations of election fraud, although he hasn’t gone as far as to question the 2020 presidential result. It’s early yet, but at this point both Jarchow and Toney <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/15/adam-jarchow-takes-more-month-than-eric-toney-raised-year/6791141001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are behind Kaul’s</a> fundraising; Kaul had over $1 million ready to spend in his campaign account at the end of December, while Jarchow and Toney have each raised between $80,000 and $100,000.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">But of course, these are only some of the highest-profile offices on the ballot in 2022 that could impact the 2024 election. Since it’s still early in the campaign, races for secretary of state and attorney general in other states could become hotly contested over the next few months. And a lot of the nuts and bolts of administering a free and fair election are hammered out on the county level, where there are <a href="https://boltsmag.org/whats-on-the-ballot/local-election-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countless more election officials</a> getting elected this year. So while it’s frighteningly difficult to know how likely it is that the 2024 election will actually get overturned, it’s definitely possible that, after 2022, the pieces will be in place to do so.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When President Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law last March, he funded federal programs designed to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and provided a third round of stimulus to Americans. But the bill also provided $350 billion in aid sent directly to states, counties and local governments to spend as they saw fit. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was an almost unprecedented amount of money. According to an analysis from <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/06/28/how-far-american-rescue-plan-dollars-will-stretch-varies-by-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pew Charitable Trusts</a>, states received aid equivalent to anywhere from 4.9 percent (Wisconsin) to 22.7 percent (Wyoming) of their spending in the previous fiscal year. Most states have a legal obligation to balance their budgets, which means unexpected surpluses like this are rare. But combined with previous coronavirus response bills and spending packages, the federal government has now spent <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/disaster/covid-19?publicLaw=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $5 trillion</a> addressing the pandemic, money that will flow through communities over the next decade and change the funding landscape in states and cities across the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">States are awash with cash.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not clear yet where all this money will go — states have an enormous <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amount of leeway</a> as to how they’ll spend it and until 2026 to do so. (In total, <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/how-states-can-best-use-federal-fiscal-recovery-funds-lessons-from" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$155 billion went out to states</a> in 2021, with the rest due to be distributed later this year.) Most states have used the windfall of cash to address the budget problems caused by the economic downturn following the pandemic and to address the inequities thrown into sharp relief during the past two years. But while there are broad commonalities in how states have spent the money, it’s also true that how relief from the pandemic is defined varies widely — not necessarily across partisan lines but in ways that are still shaped by local conditions and ideology.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These differences are more apparent after drilling down past broad categories of funding. In Oklahoma, for example, Gov. Kevin Stitt <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2021/05/17/unemployment-oklahoma-1200-workers-governor-kevin-stitt-economy/5130077001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended the enhanced unemployment benefits</a> available to many workers during the pandemic, and used some of Oklahoma’s American Rescue Plan money last spring for $1,200 bonuses to the first 20,000 workers who stopped collecting unemployment and started working full time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other states combined back-to-work bonuses with <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMmQ2NDRiNDYtN2NkZC00OTE2LThjYzQtYjAzNTE2ZDRjZWFiIiwidCI6IjM4MmZiOGIwLTRkYzMtNDEwNy04MGJkLTM1OTViMjQzMmZhZSIsImMiOjZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader workforce development packages</a> that included bonus pay for essential workers who’d worked through the pandemic and job retraining programs. Meanwhile, Vermont used <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/ACTS/ACT009/ACT009%20As%20Enacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 million</a> <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/ACTS/ACT009/ACT009%20As%20Enacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of its recovery plan</a> money to provide free classes at state colleges to workers who wanted to change careers, and Washington state used almost $169 million <a href="https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5092-S.PL.pdf?q=20210426164608" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to help pay for its paid leave program</a>. While there are variations from state to state, they will determine the recovery landscape for millions of Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that there is so much federal money flowing doesn’t change local politics, said Ed Lazere of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that has been tracking and analyzing how states are allocating their relief money. “In many cases it is shaped by what the values of the policymakers were beforehand.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, there are broad trends in how states are spending the money: Almost every state that has allocated money so far has spent some on broadband, water and sewer infrastructure, which was one of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big spending categories determined by Congress</a>.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A formula taking into account states’ unemployment rates and lost revenue from lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions determined how much aid states received, whether they received it all at once, and whether they could use it to replace lost tax revenue, and so the stimulus picture looks different in every state. Some states received all of their money at once and have already allocated it all, while a handful of states — South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, Mississippi and South Carolina — are &lt;a href="https://yallpolitics.com/2021/06/15/mississippi-to-receive-1-8-billion-from-the-american-rescue-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;just starting&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2022/01/04/extra-meetings-planned-appropriations-committee-spending-requests-accumulate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;make determinations&lt;/a&gt; on it. (Additionally, another $122 billion went &lt;a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-distribution-all-american-rescue-plan-esser-funds-and-approval-all-52-state-education-agency-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;directly to school districts&lt;/a&gt;, which largely can determine how to spend it themselves. Funding for cities and counties also complicates the picture. A tiny fraction of money allocated to municipalities — less than 0.3 percent of the total funds available, according to a 15-state study from the &lt;a href="https://www.nlc.org/article/2022/01/03/data-finds-small-municipalities-declining-arpa-slfrf-funds-is-rare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National League of Cities&lt;/a&gt; — was declined, but the rejections could have stemmed from logistical reasons rather than ideological ones.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a></p>

Within states, this has meant a mix of new programs, funding for existing programs and expansion of broadband services to more rural areas where the lack of access to reliable, fast internet made it harder for some children to attend virtual school during lockdowns. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Infrastructure has also been a big priority for states like Florida, which is <a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/globalassets/dem/recovery/american-rescue-plan-act/florida-recovery-plan-for-sfrf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending money on highways and other transportation projects</a> that had been long-planned but unfinished. Lazere said some of the need for infrastructure goes all the way back to the Great Recession, which began in 2007, and the long, slow recovery that followed. “These were areas of need that had not been addressed, [for which] there hadn’t been a dedicated state or federal funding source, so the rescue plan gave them the opportunity to tackle these problems that had been around for a long time,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, because the funds are a large, one-time payment, with no expectation that they’ll continue into the future, it encourages spending on infrastructure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It really starts with states doing that analysis, to be able to know what’s affordable over the long-term and what’s not,” said Josh Goodman, who is part of The Pew Charitable Trusts’s state fiscal health project.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But because the categories in which states are allowed to spend the money are so expansive, and the money is given without many strings attached, the kinds of projects states plan to spend the money on also reveals local political priorities and political philosophies. Broadly, states are allowed to replace revenue lost during the pandemic, and how local lawmakers define those challenges and decide how to address them varies widely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Alabama, $400 million will be used for building two new prisons. New correctional facilities for the state had been one of Gov. Kay Ivey’s priorities; <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/01/alabama-gov-kay-ivey-calls-for-gas-tax-new-prisons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/02/alabama-will-build-3-prisons-for-men-ivey-announces-do-not-publish.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she announced plans</a> for three prisons that were ultimately scrapped. But the state has been under a court order to improve mental health care in its prisons <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/documents/the_opinion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2017</a>, and advocates of the new law say using the recovery funds to build a new prison will address those problems, as well as overcrowding and inadequate staffing. They also say the new facilities will improve the overall health care and mental health care available to incarcerated individuals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The proposal passed <a href="https://abc3340.com/news/local/alabama-house-votes-to-use-400-million-from-american-rescue-plan-act-to-build-prisons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a special legislative session in September</a>. In the state House, the vote passed along party lines, with Republicans all in favor and most Democrats against, but in the state Senate it received broader support and only one Democrat voted against it. The House Democrats’ objections, along with criminal justice reform advocates in the state, are that building a new prison absent other reforms won’t solve the criminal justice system’s problems, and that the funds could have been spent on more urgent needs revealed by the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two dozen Alabama groups <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2021/12/21/organizations-challenge-use-of-covid-relief-funds-to-build-prisons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a letter</a> to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee asking for an investigation of Alabama’s use of the funds for building the prisons. “Building more prisons is a gross misuse of funds that were sent to help the people of Alabama, not punish them,” JaTaune Bosby, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, <a href="https://www.aclualabama.org/en/press-releases/alabama-organizations-call-us-house-financial-services-committee-halt-use-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in the letter</a>. But the state has argued the use falls within guidelines, and has plans to move quickly on construction. In a <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/01/31/alabama-2022-legislative-report-first-special-session/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special session last month</a>, the state also moved to allocate most of the rest of the funds to water and sewer infrastructure, broadband, and unemployment insurance tax breaks for businesses.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In more liberal states and localities, lawmakers are pursuing new financial assistance programs for local families. One idea that has picked up steam is funding <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/phoenix-approves-universal-basic-income-program-for-1000-families-12052702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guaranteed</a> <a href="https://iecam.illinois.edu/news/chicago-approves-guaranteed-basic-income-pilot-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">income</a> <a href="https://www.newarknj.gov/news/guaranteed-income-pilot-program-expands-to-400-newark-residents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pilot programs</a>, with eligible residents receiving between $500 and $1,000 in cash assistance monthly. Support for these programs <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-28/the-u-s-cities-giving-residents-direct-cash-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been growing across the ideological spectrum</a>, especially in the last few years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Madeline Neighly, who directs the guaranteed income program at the Economic Security Project, said there are currently over 60 cities involved in planning guaranteed income projects, using a mix of public funds from the American Rescue Plan and private funds. (Some programs were already in the works, and the ARPA funds are just a new potential revenue source.) And the state of California will itself <a href="https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2021/07/universal-basic-income-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend $35 million launching guaranteed income programs</a> statewide over the next five years. The money was allocated when Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/12/california-roars-back-governor-newsom-signs-100-billion-california-comeback-plan-to-accelerate-states-recovery-and-tackle-persistent-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed the state budget into law</a> last summer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Neighly said the previous pandemic relief bills helped build awareness and increased interest in launching such projects. “We saw the power of cash during the pandemic,” she said. “We saw it with the stimulus checks and the expanded child [tax] credit.” She said guaranteed income could work in concert with many of the other programs states are launching to rebuild their economies. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The impact this money will have will become even more apparent as the funds work their way into communities and start touching individual lives. Overall, though, the unprecedented amount of money is an opportunity for states to reimagine and reinvent their local economies, which could mark an important shift after two years of responding to emergencies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Lazere, the biggest takeaway is that states are all using the money, and will continue to do so as the next payments are dispersed this year. So far, no states have rejected the money outright. “What we’re hoping for and looking for is not just states plugging this money into budget holes, but actually deliberately using it to strengthen public health and the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic,” he said. “We are looking for states to use the money in ways that really set them up for a robust recovery.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Feb. 24, 7:52 a.m.):</strong> Russia has now launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. (For the latest developments, follow <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/russia-ukraine/?id=82467772" target="_blank">the ABC News live blog</a>.) Russia’s dramatic escalation of the conflict since we published the article below could shift public opinion around the world, including in the United States. But Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine comes against a backdrop of a U.S. public that is skeptical of American intervention. On Wednesday, <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/americas-role-in-the-russia-and-ukraine-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> released a survey finding that only 26 percent of American adults said the U.S. “should have a major role in the situation”; 52 percent said “minor role,” and 20 percent said “none at all.”</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">For days now, there have been reports that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/russia-ukraine/?id=82467772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia could attack Ukraine at any moment</a>, although it’s possible <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/14/world/russia-ukraine-news#as-russian-forces-menace-ukraine-western-leaders-continue-an-urgent-diplomatic-effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued diplomatic talks</a> could avert military conflict. Russia is <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-possible-invasion-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking concessions</a>, such as a promise from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that Ukraine <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-putin-nato-invasion-demands-rcna9116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will never be allowed to join the coalition and/or</a> reductions in NATO’s <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-urges-de-escalation-as-scholz-visits-moscow-for-putin-talks/6442259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">troop presence and missile deployment</a>. But as <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/03/27/a-brief-history-of-nato-from-truman-to-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the leading nation in NATO</a>, the United States must now grapple with how it will help protect its allies, many of whom are located near Russia, while managing its relationship with Ukraine, which has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/war-with-russia-has-pushed-ukrainians-toward-the-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become closer to the West in recent years</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In light of these challenges, President Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/politics/biden-zelensky-call/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has promised</a> further <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/22/ukraine-russia-military-weapons-nato-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Ukraine</a>, but <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060406.214132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. public opinion may affect</a> just how far his administration is willing to go to aid the beleaguered nation. As with many foreign policy issues, Americans don’t necessarily have well-established views on how the U.S. should respond, and in some cases their attitudes are mixed. For instance, polls suggest Americans would prefer to avoid becoming heavily involved in the conflict, but many support taking Ukraine’s side against the Russians. There is also a significant amount of variation in how and to what degree Americans want to assist Ukraine as well as a number of partisan- and age-related divisions over potential American responses. Those splits might reflect broader views on the country’s role in world affairs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked about the U.S. position in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Americans at first glance prefer to remain above the fray. In a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-u-s-involvement-opinion-poll-02-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov survey</a> conducted last week, 53 percent of Americans said the U.S. should stay out of the situation by siding with neither Ukraine or Russia in ongoing talks, while 43 percent said the U.S. should back Ukraine (only 4 percent wanted to side with Russia). A <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/557651509/20220207-Yahoo-Tabs-Ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo News/YouGov poll</a> conducted earlier in February found a similar split, with 49 percent of respondents wanting to avoid taking sides and 46 percent preferring to back Ukraine (just 5 percent said Russia). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the same poll, Americans demonstrated how their views on the larger geopolitical situation are muddled: When asked which of two statements came closer to their opinion, 40 percent said it was in the U.S.’s best interest to stop Russia and help Ukraine, compared with 33 percent who said the conflict was “none of America’s business” (although a sizable 27 percent said they didn’t know which position was closer to their view).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the mixed opinions on the broad contours of American foreign intervention, some of these questions also exposed partisan and age differences in public attitudes. For instance, in both surveys, about 3 in 5 Democrats preferred supporting Ukraine over staying out or backing Russia, while about half of Republicans and more than half of independents preferred to support neither country. But while Americans under 45 <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to be more Democratic-leaning</a>, they were more likely to say the U.S. should support neither country — or that they weren’t sure — while older Americans felt more strongly that the U.S. should support Ukraine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The age splits could reflect lingering anti-Russian views among older Americans who remember the Cold War. Polling from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/npwlx2cq4r/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov last week</a> found that about half of Americans ages 45 or older viewed Russia as an “enemy” of the U.S., while only around a quarter of those under 45 said the same. The divide may also reflect <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/the-clash-of-generations-and-american-foreign-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the skepticism</a> that many young Americans have toward American military intervention, as many came of age during the lengthy and troubled wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked about specific policy ideas, though, more Americans than not tend to favor providing assistance to Ukraine through diplomatic or economic means. Last week, 50 percent of Americans told The Economist/YouGov that it was a good idea to implement economic sanctions against Russia — including 50 percent of Republicans and 59 percent of Democrats — while only 20 percent viewed this as a bad idea. That was the most popular policy The Economist/YouGov asked about, but pluralities of slightly more than 40 percent also said allowing Ukraine to join NATO and sending Ukraine financial aid were good ideas, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And polls suggest that Americans look askance at Russian diplomatic demands: 58 percent told Yahoo News/YouGov that Putin’s desires for NATO to withdraw from Eastern Europe and bar Ukraine from joining NATO were unreasonable, compared with 12 percent who said they were reasonable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, economic sanctions and aid for Ukraine are still more popular, too, than military-based interventions. It’s true that <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/08174124/2202035_crosstabs_GEOPOLITICAL_RISK_UKRAINE_RVs_v2_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult found last week</a> that registered voters were about evenly split on whether the U.S. should send weapons to Ukraine’s government while the U.S. continues to seek a diplomatic solution with Russia, with 41 percent supporting the move and 42 percent preferring to not send weapons. But a solid plurality, 49 percent, opposed sending additional troops to Eastern Europe while talks with Russia were ongoing, compared with 36 percent who supported doing so. Moreover, there was <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/10/americans-support-sending-troops-to-russia-in-only-one-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just one scenario</a> in Morning Consult’s polling where more respondents preferred deploying troops to Eastern Europe over imposing sanctions against Russia: If Russia invaded and occupied all of Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Americans may be open to sending troops to the region or even Ukraine proper. The U.S. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/11/russia-ukraine-us-troops-poland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has already deployed 3,000 more soldiers</a> to NATO defenses in nearby Poland, and sending troops to Eastern Europe but not Ukraine as part of a larger NATO operation did get support in Morning Consult’s poll. Similarly, 61 percent expressed support for sending troops directly to Ukraine as part of a NATO coalition, compared with only 37 percent if the U.S. acted on its own. And among American adults more broadly, a plurality (40 percent) said they supported sending troops to support NATO allies in the Economist/YouGov poll. On all these questions, older Americans had more favorable attitudes toward military assistance than their younger counterparts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear what will happen in Ukraine at this point, but for now more Americans support continued diplomacy or economic sanctions versus sending military assistance to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion. But Americans are also open to U.S. military action under some circumstances, and in such a volatile situation, public opinion could change quickly depending on what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine.</p>
