<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Two of us are writing this week’s Pollapalooza, but I — Kaleigh Rogers — am taking this top bit since we’re focusing on the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/webbfirstimages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first images from the James Webb Space Telescope</a> and space exploration is in my blood. During his time as a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9adbba/apollo-fire-feature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quality-control inspector at NASA</a>, my grandfather worked on the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions, helping to put the first man on the moon and earning himself an Exceptional Bravery Medal. So when there are new discoveries from the great beyond, I tend to get a little emotional. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cut to me audibly gasping and visibly tearing up as I saw those intergalactic images. The rich data and level of detail moved me and made me think about our infinitesimal place in the universe. It wasn’t just my fellow space nerds who were feeling the feels this week, either. Social media exploded with awe and wonder at the remarkable images (and <a href="https://twitter.com/JillKrajewski/status/1546626633054015490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more</a> than <a href="https://twitter.com/_rallycap/status/1546890570815209477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dominicknero/status/1546846199151529987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memes</a>). And while I’m not convinced the public’s enthusiasm for these deep-space delights indicates much about President Biden’s approval rating (unlike <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkJacob16/status/1546821979919073283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some publications</a>), I was curious to find out what Americans think about NASA and space exploration in general.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It turns out, this is one of the few areas where Americans largely agree. In <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/07/16/americans-support-sending-astronauts-moon-and-mars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July 2021 poll from YouGov/The Economist</a>, a majority of Americans said the U.S. should send astronauts to the moon and Mars. This was true across political parties, with slim majorities for Democrats, Republicans and independents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most Americans are on the same page about funding space exploration, too. About a third of Democrats, Republicans and independents said government funding of space exploration should be kept the same, and about 40 percent of each group said funding should be increased. Find me another issue where roughly the same share of Republicans and Democrats agree that the government is not spending enough money. Grandpa Buck would be happy to know that about three-quarters of Americans across the political spectrum — 77 percent of Democrats, 76 percent of Republicans and 75 percent of independents — also agreed that the effort made to land the first astronauts on the moon was definitely or probably worth it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For me, one of the most exciting findings from the Webb telescope actually wasn’t one of the eye-popping images but a graph of atmospheric composition instead. That’s because the graph showed evidence of water vapor on an exoplanet called WASP-96b (cool name). We all know water is a key ingredient for life, so whenever we detect it on another planet, it tends to conjure up mental images of extraterrestrial life (though <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/07/13/jwst-exoplanet-wasp-96b-water/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this particular planet</a> is very hot, doesn’t have a rocky surface and is missing a thin atmosphere, so experts don’t suspect it’s a great candidate to host life). On the question of alien lifeforms, Democrats and Republicans are also aligned. In <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/05/24132604/2205143_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH_05-25-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> from May, registered voters were asked whether they believed life exists outside of Earth. Roughly the same share of Democrats, independents and Republicans (28 percent, 25 percent and 23 percent, respectively) said “yes, definitely.” Another 40 percent of Democrats, 37 percent of independents and 32 percent of Republicans said “yes, probably.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are also equally conspiratorial on this front. Seventy-nine percent of Democrats, 73 percent of independents and 84 percent of Republicans said the government has definitely or probably hidden evidence of UFOs from the public. I guess finding consensus among American voters isn’t that hard — you just have to look a little further.</p>



<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>Tampons have become increasingly expensive and difficult to procure, and younger voters are noticing. Forty-one percent of likely voters between the ages of 18 and 29 are “very” concerned about national tampon shortages, according to <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/7/7/young-voters-are-more-concerned-about-the-tampon-shortage">a poll conducted by Data for Progress</a> last month. Only 14 percent of likely voters of all ages, however, were very concerned about such a shortage. Supply chain bottlenecks and higher prices for materials have contributed to a nearly 10 percent rise in national average tampon costs since the start of 2022. The same survey also assessed attitudes toward the “pink tax,” or how products marketed toward women cost more than the same products marketed toward men. A sizable majority of likely voters (76 percent), regardless of age, said they would “strongly” (56 percent) or “somewhat” (20 percent) support legislative efforts to ban such discrimination in product prices.</li></ul><ul><li>Over half of Americans believe they are their harshest critic, per <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/veycmvelf3/toplines_Imposter_Syndrome_20220607.pdf">a June 7-10 YouGov survey</a> studying imposter syndrome. Fifty-three percent said they criticize themselves more than others criticize them, while only 11 percent thought others criticized them more. (Ah, to be one of those chosen few!) Only 10 percent thought they exaggerated their achievements, compared with 38 percent who said they downplayed achievements. Notably, 46 percent of Americans stated they would rather struggle alone than reach out for help. </li></ul><ul><li>A whopping 64 percent of Democratic primary voters do not prefer Biden as their party’s presidential candidate in 2024, <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/us0722-crosstabs-nyt071122/33ffa85627ee4648/full.pdf">according to a July 5-7 New York Times/Siena College poll</a>. A third of these naysayers cited his age as their primary concern, while another third referenced his job performance. Meanwhile, 77 percent of all voters said the United States was heading in the wrong direction. Though the exact figure varies slightly, a majority of voters across every party, race, age group, level of educational attainment, region and gender agreed that the nation’s trajectory was negative. That’s a second thing Americans can agree on, beside the stunning space photos: We’re all barreling toward something bad. Unity!</li></ul><ul><li>Eating just a little bit can’t hurt, right? Well, depends who you ask. Americans are split on whether certain foods, even when consumed in choice amounts, can be beneficial for a healthy diet, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/health/articles-reports/2022/07/08/which-foods-and-drinks-do-americans-think-are-bad">per a survey conducted by YouGov last month</a>. While 23 percent said consuming salt in moderation was healthy, 44 percent thought it was detrimental to one’s health. The divide carries over to caffeinated beverages, as 36 percent of Americans said black coffee was good for one’s health, and 14 percent said it was not. Meanwhile, 37 percent said red meat was good for you, but 27 percent had beef with that take. </li></ul><ul><li>Forty-three percent of American adults under the age of 30 say they know people who use gender-neutral pronouns such as “they,” compared with just 27 percent of all adults, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2022/07/08/viewpoints-pronouns-yougov-poll-june-29-july-4-202?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=gender">according to a recent YouGov survey</a>. Interpersonal relationships seem to affect Americans’ feelings about using these pronouns: A majority of adults who personally knew someone who used gender-neutral pronouns said they’d feel “very” (43 percent) or “somewhat” (31 percent) comfortable using these pronouns for anyone who asked them to do so. To a certain degree, the converse was also true: Americans who did not personally know anyone who used gender-neutral pronouns were more likely to report feeling very (33 percent) or somewhat (28 percent) uncomfortable if asked to use them.</li></ul><h2>Biden approval</h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">This week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/biden-approval-polling-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Siena College/New York Times poll</a> showed President Biden with just a 33 percent approval rating, a result so poor that it touched off speculation — including from <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1546520924957990913?s=20&amp;t=jKKV0neUqZUotFWPk7xMBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yours truly</a> — about whether he would even run again in 2024. The Siena/New York Times number is on the low end of the polling consensus, but Biden’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating in our polling average</a> — about 39 percent<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> — is nonetheless a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically low number</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet, the same poll showed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/upshot/poll-2022-midterms-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neck-and-neck race for Congress</a>. Democrats led by 1 percentage point among registered voters<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which makes for the most direct comparison with the poll’s Biden approval number, which was also taken among registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> on the question of which party voters preferred controlled Congress and trailed by 1 point among likely voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What to make of this seeming divergence? How much does the president’s approval rating <em>actually </em>matter for predicting congressional outcomes?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From a zoomed-out perspective, the answer is that there’s a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasonably strong relationship</a>. If you knew nothing else about the race for Congress, you’d expect an unpopular president’s party to lose seats. And indeed, that’s likely what will happen this year, too. Republicans are an 87 percent favorite to take over control of the House, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Deluxe version of our forecast</a>. The Senate <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remains much closer to a toss-up</a>, but that has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more to do with poor Republican candidates</a> than anything the Democrats are doing well.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-continue-win-georgia-2022-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-86847505</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But predicting the number of seats lost in Congress based on the president’s approval rating is not <em>quite</em> the question we’re interested in from a forecasting standpoint. Rather, we want to know how much the president’s approval rating matters <em>given all the other information we have about the race</em>. In other words, is Biden’s poor approval already “baked in” to the congressional generic ballot polls and polls of individual House and Senate races? Or is there reason to think that the Democrats’ standing will get worse between now and November?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The statistical answer is that it’s <em>mostly</em> baked in. Warning: The following paragraphs are going to be a bit technical. If you want more of an intuitive answer, skip ahead to the bolded bullet points below.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way our model addresses this</a> is by looking at every congressional race since 1990 and evaluating how predictable the movement in the generic ballot has been based on baseline conditions, which we sometimes refer to as the “fundamentals.” Specifically, the factors it looks at include the president’s approval rating, the result of the previous election for Congress, whether or not the election is a midterm and the degree of political polarization. (Times of high political polarization — like now — will tend to produce less dramatic swings in races for Congress because there are fewer swing voters.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-dems-energizing-abortion-evens-midterms-equation-silver-86558599</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Right now, those “fundamentals” expect Democrats to eventually lose the House popular vote by about 8 points, which would be an awful result for the party and would very likely result in its loss of both chambers of Congress. By comparison, if Biden had a breakeven approval rating instead of being about 17 points underwater, the “fundamentals” would predict Democrats to lose the popular vote by around 4.5 points, which would still mean almost certain doom in the House but might be enough for them to save the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the model also weighs those “fundamentals” against the current state of affairs. Right now, Democrats <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trail in our generic congressional ballot polling average</a> — a proxy for the House popular vote — by about 2 points. But that’s actually more like a 4-point deficit among likely voters, since Republicans are likely to have a turnout advantage in November. Our model accounts for this, but the model also accounts for factors aside from the generic ballot in forecasting the House popular vote, and when we take into consideration those factors, our model predicts Democrats to lose the popular vote by almost 6 points, not that far from what the “fundamentals” show.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-supreme-court-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-86637136</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Even if there were a bigger gap, though, the “fundamentals” ultimately do not get all that much weight in the model. The reason is simply that, even at this fairly early point in the cycle, the generic ballot (at least if you properly adjust it to account for likely voters) and other indicators directly related to the current election have historically been more reliable predictors than the “fundamentals.” The model does expect conditions to get a bit worse for Democrats, but really just a bit.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, at this point, the model regresses about one-sixth of the way toward the “fundamentals,” which means that it expects the House popular vote to swing about half of a point more toward Republicans between now and November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what is the intuition behind this? Here are a few factors to keep in mind:</p>



<h2>1. <strong>Voters have good reasons to disapprove of Biden without wanting Republicans in Congress</strong> </h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">When your approval rating has fallen into the 30s, you’ve not only lost the confidence of most swing voters but also some members of your own party. The Siena/New York Times poll, for instance, showed Biden with <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/us0722-crosstabs-nyt071122/33ffa85627ee4648/full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a 70 percent approval rating even among Democrats</a>. However, <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/us0722-crosstabs-nyt071322/a775fbafdcf9db9d/full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90 percent of Democrats in that same poll</a> prefer Democratic control of Congress, compared to just 4 percent who want the GOP in charge.<br><br>One concern for Democrats is that those disaffected voters won’t turn out. Still, there’s no particular reason to expect them to vote Republican if they do. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/biden-approval-polling-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lot of them think Biden is too old</a> — a concern also shared by many independent voters — but that’s more a factor for 2024 than in congressional preferences for 2022.<br><br>And on many issues — from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-midterms-could-most-affect-abortion-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/10/texas-trans-kids-abortion-lgbtq-gender-ideology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ rights</a> to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-election-deniers-dominating-the-primaries-in-colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrity of the 2020 vote</a> — Republicans are adopting highly right-wing, partisan positions that have little appeal to swing voters and might even motivate otherwise disaffected Democrats to turn out. Parties <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-strongest-house-candidates-in-2020-were-mostly-moderate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally pay a penalty for ideological extremism</a>. In other words, although Democrats have also adopted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/magazine/moderate-democrat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular left-wing positions</a> on many issues, Republicans aren’t as poised to capitalize on a high inflation and poor electoral environment for Democrats as a more moderate, less Trumpian version of the party would be.</p>



<h2>2. <strong>It’s usually best to trust a direct measure over an indirect one</strong> </h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is just a good principle of statistical analysis. If you have a direct measure of the quantity that you’re interested in, there’s not much need for a proxy or an indirect one.<br><br>Suppose, for instance, that you’re trying to estimate the volume of home sales in — I don’t know — Indianapolis. You could imagine some clever ways to get at this. You could drive around town and count the number of “FOR SALE” signs. Or you could track the number of clicks on Zillow and other websites that list homes for sale. But all of that is beside the point because home sales can be <a href="https://indianarealtors.com/consumers/housing-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directly measured</a>, albeit with something of a lag until reports are compiled.<br><br>Likewise, if you’re interested in races for Congress, and you ask voters how they’re going to vote for Congress and also how they feel about the president, voters’ preference for Congress is the direct measure and the one that should be more reliable. It’s presumptuous, frankly, to suggest otherwise and to disbelieve a voter who says she disapproves of Biden but also wants Democrats to stay in charge of Congress.</p>

<h2>3. <strong>Biden and Democrats weren’t that popular to begin with</strong> </h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national exit poll in November 2020</a>, 52 percent had a favorable opinion of Biden and 46 percent had an unfavorable opinion. That’s considerably better than his numbers now, and Biden won a fairly comfortable victory in the popular vote. But, it also wasn’t the sort of sweeping mandate that, say, former President Barack Obama had in 2008, which was accompanied by approval and favorability numbers that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/04/23/obama-at-100-days-strong-job-approval-even-higher-personal-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially soared into the 60s and 70s</a>. Moreover, Democrats rode into Obama’s first term with 257 House seats, far more than the 222 they held after the 2020 election.<br><br>Part of the reason that the 2010 midterms were so awful for Democrats was because they had a long way to fall from being about as popular as a party probably could be in modern American politics. In 2022, Democrats don’t have that problem because they weren’t very popular to begin with. They barely held onto the House.<br><br>So while goodwill toward Biden may have been just enough to get him over the hump in 2020 — and a lot of that goodwill has now evaporated — conditions aren’t necessarily <em>that</em> different than they were two years ago. The major parties are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355280/party-favorable-ratings-near-parity-viewed-negatively.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both unpopular</a>, there are few if any nationally beloved political figures and the country is highly polarized. What’s more, with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular</a> former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/14/trump-2024-announcement-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially set to declare a 2024 bid soon</a>, he could also be a factor in the race — maybe one that helps Democrats.</p>



<h2>4. So far, presidential approval and the race for Congress have diverged, not converged </h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, I’d note that if you had predicted some months ago that polls for Congress and Biden’s numbers would have converged toward one another, you would have been wrong. Since May 1, Biden’s approval rating has declined by about 9 points:</p>



<figure><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And yet, the generic ballot has been essentially unchanged:</p>



<figure><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/generic-ballot-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/generic-ballot-2.png"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Instead, as voters have gathered more information about the race, they have drawn more of a distinction between how they feel about Biden and what they’d like to see happen in Congress. Maybe this trend will reverse itself. But the “fundamentalists” — the analysts who think the races for Congress are predictable based on presidential approval and other baseline conditions — have been wrong so far.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (July 15, 2022, 11:06 a.m.):</strong> A previous version of this article calculated the change in Biden’s approval rating from May 1, 2021 — not May 1, 2022. That calculation has been updated to reflect the change in Biden’s approval since May 1, 2022.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the 2020 election cycle, Georgia found itself at the center of the American political universe. Georgians handed control of the U.S. Senate to Democrats in a pair of dramatic runoffs and voted for a Democrat for president for the first time in 28 years. But just a few years before, it was hardly a battleground state. In 2016, Trump won the state without ever having visited a single time as the Republican presidential nominee. So how did Georgia find itself in such a prominent place in American politics?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In his new book, “Flipped: How Georgia Turned Purple and Broke the Monopoly on Republican Power,” Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Greg Bluestein writes about Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and their successful elections to the U.S. Senate as well as Stacey Abrams and the Democratic coalition she helped turn out at the polls. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Galen Druke talks to Bluestein about his book and delves into how Georgia politics are evolving in the 2022 midterms.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In games such as golf, you win by scoring lower than any of your opponents. But in the realm of presidential job approval, such an approach is a recipe for political upheaval, as President Biden has found over the past few months. Polls continue to show his approval rating in poor shape, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/biden-approval-polling-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even Democrats are asking questions</a> about his political future amid broad dissatisfaction with the current state of the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Biden is dancing with a bleak bit of history: His <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating of 39 percent</a><a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> is now the worst of any elected president at this point in his presidency since the end of World War II, according to FiveThirtyEight’s historical presidential approval data. In other words, Biden is arguably in worse shape than any other elected president heading into his first midterm election, including his four most recent predecessors, who, like Biden, were operating in an increasingly polarized political climate.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Biden could have the lowest midterm approval rating" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iIUGB/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="495" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">After entering office, most recent presidents see a decline in their approval ratings, but since Biden’s numbers peaked at 55 percent in March 2021, they have moved in only one direction: down. To some extent, President Barack Obama’s approval rating followed a similar trajectory, but he started off with better numbers than any of the other four most recent presidents and was still well above where Biden is at this point in his presidency. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/latest-jan-hearing-testimony-affect-midterm-elections-86274149</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">By comparison, President Bill Clinton actually mounted a comeback nearly a year into his presidency before his approval fell again in the latter part of 1994. Even President Donald Trump’s low approval rating ticked back up into the low 40s in 2018 after falling to 36 percent in December 2017. And, of course, President George W. Bush topped them all when his approval jumped to a record-high 88 percent in 2001 due to a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rally-around-the-flag-events-are-rare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally-around-the-flag moment</a> shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why is Biden’s approval so low? For starters, Americans have a really dim view of how things are going in the U.S. For instance, about 75 percent believe the country is on the wrong track according to the <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RealClearPolitics average</a> of recent polls, while only 18 percent say the country is moving in the right direction. To be sure, Americans have long held negative views about the direction the country is moving in — RCP’s average hasn’t been net positive once in the past 13 years — but this is still the highest level of dissatisfaction since 2011.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-when-americans-dont-trust-institutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many factors</a> are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-feel-burnt-out-personally-and-politically/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving</a> this overall <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-americans-unhappy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feeling of dissatisfaction</a> among Americans, but inflation is arguably the biggest reason. Inflation, which is at its <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=rocU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest point since the early 1980s</a>, has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/american-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently ranked as the top issue</a> Americans are worried about in our polling with Ipsos. In the most recent <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-birth-control-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos</a> poll, 62 percent of Americans told us that inflation or increasing prices was one of the most important issues facing the country, ranking far ahead of any other topic we asked about. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-continue-win-georgia-2022-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-86847505</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, too, inflation has soured Americans further on Biden’s job performance. For instance, an <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/three-in-five-americans-disapprove-of-bidens-handling-of-economic-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early June poll from Ipsos/ABC News</a> found that only 28 percent of Americans approved of Biden’s handling of inflation; along with his handling of gas prices (27 percent approved), inflation ranked lowest of any of the issues the poll asked about. This stacks up with what’s happened to past presidents, too, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable upticks in inflation</a> have often coincided with sharp declines in presidential job approval. This is particularly true of rising gas prices, as studies have found that <a href="https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Presidential-Approval-and-Gas-Prices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gas price increases</a> are linked to lower presidential approval — and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-americans-may-or-may-not-blame-biden-for-higher-gas-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gas prices have soared</a> during this period of high inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recently, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-economy-still-the-most-important-thing-for-trumps-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connection between economic perceptions and presidential standing</a> hasn’t been as strong, but political scientists John Sides and Robert Griffin found that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/12/biden-approval-economy-inflation-presidential-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling consumer sentiment</a> is once again a useful indicator for understanding presidential approval, as it explains a lot of what we’re seeing with the decline in Biden’s approval.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, that reconnection between the economy and presidential approval may be partly down to the decreasing confidence Democrats have in the state of the economy. In fact, even though Democrats are still more confident than Republicans or independents about the economy, we can see that Democrats’ opinions about economic conditions are actually worse now than at any time during Trump’s presidency, using consumer sentiment data from the <a href="https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers</a>.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Even Democrats are down on the economy" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZsSD7/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The upshot is that this may have weakened Democratic loyalty to Biden. Just 69 percent to 76 percent of Democrats said they approved of Biden in polls from <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/ipsos-core-political-presidential-approval-tracker-07072022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos/Reuters</a>, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/sdsvy1azjc/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a> and <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/07/11135504/2206231_crosstabs_GEOPOLITICAL_RISK_RV_RVs_v1_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> conducted in early July. This sounds high, but it’s much lower than what <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2018-07/reuters-ipsos-data-core-political-2018-07-11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these pollsters</a> found for <a href="https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180708_crosstabs_POLITICO_v1_DK-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s approval rating among Republicans</a> during the same period <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/j4bk4qaafk/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2018</a>, when it hovered between 84 percent and 88 percent. Of course, economic conditions were more favorable during Trump’s presidency, which may have helped keep Republicans firmly behind Trump, but regardless of party loyalty, the reality is that Biden has lost ground among pretty much every group we have numbers for, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuing a trend</a> we first observed in October. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back then, close to 35 percent of independents approved of Biden, a figure that’s now sunk to around 30 percent. Meanwhile, Biden’s approval among Black Americans may have fallen even more, going from the high 60s to about 60 percent; among Latino Americans, his approval has gone from around 50 percent to the low-to-mid 40s. White Americans are more Republican-leaning, so Biden had less ground to lose with them to begin with, but even still, his numbers among them have slipped from the high 30s to the mid 30s.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One other group that has soured on Biden is younger Americans, especially considering they were <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Elections/exit-polls-2020-us-presidential-election-results-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most Democratic-leaning</a> age group in 2020 (and in most recent elections). The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a> and the Cooperative Election Study suggest that around 60 percent or more of voters 18 to 29 backed Biden in 2020, yet <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/0atxy0xx1u/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent polls suggest</a> Biden’s approval among that age group has <a href="https://60p3co1nax34ovc830mr2sak-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/June-2022-Omnibus-External-Crosstabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fallen into the 30s</a>, or <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/us0722-crosstabs-nyt071122/33ffa85627ee4648/full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even lower</a> in some surveys.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-supreme-court-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-86637136</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Economic dissatisfaction certainly plays into the disillusionment that young people may have of Biden, but other reports suggest that some of that frustration may also lie in their anger over the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/23042037/joe-biden-young-voters-disapprove-progressive-gen-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited progress on issues</a> like climate change and canceling student debt. Looking ahead to the midterm elections, the discontent young people feel toward the president could be a real problem, as it might dampen their enthusiasm to vote — that could be bad for Democrats since young voters are already <a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far less likely to turn out</a> in midterms than in presidential elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As it currently stands, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394628/americans-intensity-running-high-midterms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls suggest</a> that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/economic-issues-top-publics-agenda-poll/story?id=85183412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans as a whole are more enthusiastic</a> than Democrats about the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-more-voters-trust-republicans-handle-inflation-crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming election</a>, although most recent surveys asking that question predate the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing abortion as a constitutional right. This is an issue that could be motivating for Democrats this fall, and in fact, we’ve already seen some movement toward Democrats in our generic ballot average. It remains to be seen, though, whether that’s a short-term blip or a more long-lasting change in the electoral environment, and of course someone who is unenthusiastic can still vote — an unenthusiastic vote counts the same as an enthusiastic one.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-dems-energizing-abortion-evens-midterms-equation-silver-86558599</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Nevertheless, the historical relationship between presidential approval and the performance of the president’s party in midterm elections should scare Democrats. Generally speaking, the worse a president’s approval is, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the more seats that party tends to lose</a> in the House.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This relationship is somewhat true for the Senate, too, but because only about one-third of Senate seats are up each cycle, it’s not a truly national election like it is for the House, where all 435 seats are up. For instance, while &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Republicans lost control of the House&lt;/a&gt; in the 2018 election, they actually &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;gained two seats&lt;/a&gt; in the Senate despite Trump’s approval rating sitting in the low 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> Thinking back to that first chart, three of the four presidents preceding Biden saw their party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose at least 40 House seats</a> in their first midterm election. The exception was Bush, whose party actually gained six seats in the 2002 election, but he had an unusually high approval rating at the time of his first midterm. That’s still notable, though, because it means it has taken that kind of anomaly to see the president’s party suffer fewer losses — or even achieve gains — in House elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We can’t know for sure where Biden’s approval will go from here, but many of the factors playing into his approval rating don’t look likely to disappear anytime soon. And that could be a major anchor weighing down Democrats this fall.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">During an hours-long meeting at the White House on Dec. 18, 2020, White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson fired off a text: “The west wing is UNHINGED” — emphasis hers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The meeting Hutchinson was referring to that night involved then-President Donald Trump, White House attorneys and a coterie of outside influencers assisting in a crusade to overturn the election. At the meeting, voices grew so loud that staffers could hear shouting from down the hall. Eric Herschmann, then a senior adviser to Trump, nearly got in a fist fight with Michael Flynn, the retired general and former national security adviser. And Rudy Giuliani may or may not have <a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1546917426863931392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called Trump’s White House advisers</a> “a bunch of pussies.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/02/02/trump-oval-office-meeting-sidney-powell?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details of this meeting</a> had already leaked, but the full scope of the tense evening was outlined in testimony during the Tuesday hearing held by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Unsurprisingly, these salacious details dominated the reactions following the hearings, both online and in media reports. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the true lurid details of the hearings are in the whole trying-to-overturn-democracy thing. Trump’s White House staff, his campaign and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/bill-barr-calls-bullshit-on-trumps-election-lies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his own Justice Department</a> made clear to him there was no evidence of election fraud, but he continued to claim there was anyway. He continued to pressure election officials and then-Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the results. Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-panel-looks-trump-white-house-cassidy-hutchinson-testimony-rcna35550" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew many of his supporters were armed</a> that day when he spoke to them, but he encouraged them to go to the Capitol anyway. He knew they had breached the Capitol, yet he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-mob-failure/2021/01/11/36a46e2e-542e-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waited hours to call off his supporters</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/latest-jan-hearing-testimony-affect-midterm-elections-86274149</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The Dec. 18 meeting, then, is important in how it augments <em>those</em> events. The committee took care to emphasize the timing: The meeting took place four days after the Electoral College vote, a deadline after which many in Trump’s inner circle believed (and logic would dictate) the fight over the results should have ended. This was made clear through testimony from former Attorney General Bill Barr, who said, “In my mind that was the end of the matter,” and former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who said once the litigation had concluded she started to plan for “life after the administration.” Even Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, when asked <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/12/1111123258/jan-6-committee-hearing-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether she thought the Electoral College vote marked the end</a> of the administration, said, “I think so, I think it was my sentiment probably prior as well.” Yet just days later, here was Trump hosting individuals who continued to claim there was a path to overturning the results. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The tension itself that night was also part of the broader story of Trump’s election fraud claims. Members of both the election-denying crew who visited the White House that night — which included Giuliani, Flynn, lawyer Sidney Powell and Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrne — and members of Trump’s staff testified in recorded depositions that the evening became heated because the outsiders continued to push the election fraud theory while the staffers reminded them that there was no evidence. Both sides said the animosity that night was because Trump’s closest advisers were pushing back against the baseless claims of fraud, yet in the wee hours of the next morning, Trump sent out a now-infamous tweet announcing the rally on Jan. 6 to his followers: “Be there, will be wild!”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday’s hearing wasn’t the first time titillating details were included in the testimony — sprinkled throughout the hearings were allegations such as Giuliani <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/rudy-giuliani-blasts-trump-aides-said-was-drunk-election-night-rcna33485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting hammered</a> on election night (a claim Giuliani has denied) and Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/28/january-6-hearings-cassidy-hutchinson-key-moments-video-analysis-00042914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurling a plate of ketchup</a> at the wall of the White House dining room (a claim <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/108568349673244821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump has denied</a>). But while it’s easy to get distracted by these moments, the committee has kept its eye on the ball, unveiling exactly what the president knew and when he knew it. It’s not a crime to host a heated meeting or to smash a plate of food against the wall. It is a crime to mount an insurrection. The committee is more focused on trying to figure out whether the latter than the former happened, even if the headlines suggest otherwise.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Planned Parenthood has been controversial since its 1916 founding, but the latest wave of political battles against it <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12189446/mike-pence-planned-parenthood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began in earnest in 2007</a>, when then-Rep. Mike Pence introduced an amendment to a House of Representatives’ appropriations bill to block federal funds from going to the organization’s nationwide network of reproductive health clinics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Planned Parenthood was targeted because it’s the largest abortion provider in the United States, but it wasn’t its abortion services that were on the chopping block. Federal law already prohibits federal funds from being used for abortion services. Instead, the bill would have ended payments to Planned Parenthood for other health services, like cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted infections, regular reproductive health exams and contraception. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The goal of Republican pro-life lawmakers like Pence has long been to put abortion clinics out of business. But what the long-running fight against Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers shows is that access to abortion and birth control are often linked. In fact, almost <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/journals/j.contraception.2010.04.010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all clinics that provide abortion services</a> also provide contraceptive services. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many states, anti-abortion politics can limit patients’ access to contraception, especially low-income women who rely on publicly funded clinics. That could be even more true as some abortion clinics around the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/us/abortion-clinics-closing-roe-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start to close</a> following the Supreme Court’s ruling last month <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturning the constitutional right to abortion</a>. For many people worried about an unplanned pregnancy, all of the tools that they might use to prevent one — from birth control to abortion — are out of reach simply because of where they live.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“My biggest fear right now is the fact that, as we are heading into this post-Roe phase, is that red states — and especially red Southern states — where there are already so few Planned Parenthoods, are going to lose them and as those are in essence, the same place that people can even get contraception, it’s going to make all of this so much more dire,” said Robin Marty, director of operations for the West Alabama Women’s Center.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Planned Parenthood clinics are an important part of the reproductive health landscape. Currently, many low-income patients without private insurance access birth control through Medicaid or Title X, the latter of which funds clinics that provide birth control and other family-planning services. According to Planned Parenthood, in 2018 <a href="https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/health-care-equity/medicaid-and-reproductive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of its patients received Medicaid</a>, and according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Planned Parenthood in 2019 served <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/financing-family-planning-services-for-low-income-women-the-role-of-public-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32 percent</a> of the patients who sought contraceptives at safety-net clinics.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/overturning-roe-means-abortion-access-us-fivethirtyeight-85676655</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But more than that, Planned Parenthood and other clinics that offer abortions are often exclusively focused on reproductive care, which means <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/financing-family-planning-services-for-low-income-women-the-role-of-public-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patients can sometimes obtain contraception faster and have a wider range of options</a> than other places, like <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/eligibility-and-registration/health-centers/fqhc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federally Qualified Health Centers</a> or through county health departments, that see other patients for needs beyond just reproductive health care.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marty said, for instance, that in Alabama, most Title X funds are distributed through county health departments and there is often only one department per county, regardless of the population relying on that clinic for services. “Because of that, most people are waiting three months, four months in order to be able to get in for birth control,” she said. “I’ve been in Alabama for a little over a year now, and one of the things that has utterly blown me away is how little birth control access already exists in the state and in the South,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And some states have already moved to further restrict access to these services. At least four states — <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-st-louis-region-southwest-missouri/who-we-are/press-releases/missouri-just-became-fourth-state-to-approve-defunding-planned-parenthood-biden-administration-must-take-action-immediately" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi and Missouri</a> — have attempted to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds. These bans have been challenged in court, but so far federal judges have allowed <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/16/543974021/federal-appeals-court-says-arkansas-can-block-medicaid-payments-to-planned-paren" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Arkansas</a> and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/03/10/planned-parenthood-medicaid-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas bans</a> to stand. Karen Stone, vice president of public policy and government relations at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement that Planned Parenthood is “urging the administration to enforce” a provision that says Medicaid recipients should be able to choose their own providers. “Right now, a number of the states that have or are attempting to ban abortion have also cut off Medicaid patients’ access to preventive care,” the statement said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even more fundamental, though, <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 states have not expanded Medicaid</a> under the Affordable Care Act at all. And without Medicaid expansion, <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=The%20uninsured%20rate%20among%20low,to%2034%20percent%20in%202019." target="_blank" rel="noopener">uninsured rates remain higher in these states than the rest of the nation</a>, which means patients who want access to contraception don’t have the care that Medicaid guarantees. And as you can see in the map below, there’s a lot of overlap between the states that haven’t expanded Medicaid and those that have or plan to limit access to abortion. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1210" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/potts.BIRTH-CONTROL.0713.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/potts.BIRTH-CONTROL.0713.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/potts.BIRTH-CONTROL.0713.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/potts.BIRTH-CONTROL.0713.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That said, even in states where Medicaid has been expanded but abortion is banned or limited within a few weeks of conception, there are other barriers to receiving contraceptive care. A particular point of contention is emergency contraception, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/02/22/172595689/morning-after-pills-dont-cause-abortion-studies-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which doesn’t end a pregnancy</a> but has come under fire from <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/05/19/some-states-already-are-targeting-birth-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislators who believe</a> it might prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. (Studies have shown it works primarily <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/02/22/172595689/morning-after-pills-dont-cause-abortion-studies-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by preventing ovulation</a>.) “I think that has opened the door for politicians, particularly in these more hostile states to … think about using language that that exists in anti-abortion bills” to limit access to birth control, said Megan Kavanaugh, a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fifteen states and Washington, D.C., currently require emergency rooms to dispense emergency contraception on request, but many of those states have not restricted abortion rights since the Supreme Court decision, according to the Guttmacher Institute. (Additionally, Arkansas, Colorado, Virginia and Texas require emergency rooms to provide information about emergency contraception, while Ohio and Pennsylvania require emergency rooms to dispense emergency contraception but lack an enforcement mechanism or allow providers to opt out.) Thirteen other states allow doctors, hospitals, pharmacists and/or employers to refuse to administer or prescribe emergency contraception. And many of these states that allow providers to opt out of providing emergency contraception are also now banning abortion, or limiting it to very early in pregnancy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Title X program is supposed to provide a backstop for uninsured patients to still have access to birth control, but how those funds are distributed and used is often political. For instance, in 2019, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2020/02/trump-administrations-domestic-gag-rule-has-slashed-title-x-networks-capacity-half" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instituted a rule</a> that clinics that provide or refer patients to abortion services couldn’t receive Title X funds, effectively blocking Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics from receiving money from the program. Providers referred to it as <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/in-huge-victory-for-sexual-and-reproductive-health-care-biden-harris-administration-announces-end-to-title-x-gag-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a “gag” rule</a>, and Planned Parenthood <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/trump-administration-gag-rule-forces-planned-parenthood-out-of-title-x-national-program-for-birth-control-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled out of some states</a> where they had been providing Title X-funded services because they refused to comply with the ban. (Six states — Hawaii, Maine, Oregon, Vermont, Utah and Washington — saw <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2020/02/trump-administrations-domestic-gag-rule-has-slashed-title-x-networks-capacity-half" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all of their Title X clinics</a> pull out of the program.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, in the following years, 2.4 million fewer patients were served by Title X clinics, <a href="https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2021-09/title-x-fpar-2020-national-summary-sep-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to an analysis</a> from the federal Office of Population Affairs. While some of that was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the OPA found that about two-thirds of the loss in clients was attributable to the Trump rules, versus about a third to the pandemic. The Biden administration reversed those rules <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/04/hhs-issues-final-regulation-aimed-at-ensuring-access-to-equitable-affordable-client-centered-quality-family-planning-services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2021</a>, but that only recently went into effect, and service levels haven’t bounced back. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/01/biden-title-x-reproductive-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funding for the program has thus far remained relatively stagnant</a>, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even before 2019, though, access to Title X services depended on where patients lived. In a 2021 study, political scientists Candis Watts Smith, Rebecca Kreitzer, Kellen Kane and Tracee Saunders <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article/46/2/277/166722/Affordable-but-Inaccessible-Contraception-Deserts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examined patient access to Planned Parenthood clinics in the Title X network</a> located within a reasonable distance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although the 10 states they studied distributed Title X funds in a variety of ways, overall, between <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article/46/2/277/166722/Affordable-but-Inaccessible-Contraception-Deserts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 and 53 percent of reproductive-age residents</a> lived in a contraception desert, meaning the nearest clinics were beyond what they classified a reasonable traveling distance.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The states studied included seven of the 10 most populous states. The researchers used a definition of “reasonable” which varied by where people lived: A 15-minute drive was considered reasonable for a densely populated area, for instance, while an hour’s drive was considered reasonable for people who live in an isolated community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> Moreover, low-income people and people of color were disproportionately likely to live in a contraception desert, and they found that this problem would be made worse if Planned Parenthood were blocked from the program entirely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, patients seeking abortions are already likely driving longer distances to receive care, further straining a system that also provides contraception care. “The health care centers located in what we’re calling surge states are going to necessarily need to be able to provide and meet these patients’ needs for abortion care, and that could very well impact their capacity to provide the other range of sexual reproductive health care needs that our patients have,” Kavanaugh said. They may need to focus on abortion care at the expense of other services in some instances, she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why as abortion clinics continue to close, an already strained system will now have to absorb all of the reproductive health care needs that will go unaddressed, especially if more pregnancies continue because of a lack of access to birth control and abortion. “Right now it’s important, it’s really important, to make sure that our family planning network is robust and well-funded across the country,” said Alina Salganicoff, director of women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “Particularly in places where abortion will no longer be available.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been more than two weeks since the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health</a> that there is no consitutional right to abortion, overturning the precedent set in 1973’s Roe v. Wade decision. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This has set off</a> a scramble <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-midterms-could-most-affect-abortion-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">across the country</a>, as <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/interactive-map-shows-abortion-bans-effect-doctors-face/story?id=85881916" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some states move to restrict legal access to abortion</a> while others seek to expand it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polls show that Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-views-on-abortion-are-pretty-stagnant-their-views-on-the-supreme-court-are-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely disapprove of the court’s decision</a>, and the latest <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey</a> found that Americans are now more likely to prioritize abortion as a major issue — even if it still isn’t their top concern. Conducted shortly after the court overturned Roe,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 27-July 5, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos once again interviewed the same 2,000 or so Americans from our previous two survey waves using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>. And from a list of 20 topics, the more than 1,500 adults who responded ranked abortion as the fourth-most important issue facing the country, with 19 percent rating it as a leading concern.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had 1,549 respondents in the third wave of the panel survey. As was the case in the previous waves of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. Sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.2 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> This marked a notable increase from the 9 percent who ranked abortion as a top issue in our last survey released in early June. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="More Americans are now worried about abortion after Dobbs" aria-label="Range Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pbyEu/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="603" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Despite the clear uptick in concern about abortion, however, the issue still substantially trailed three other issues: inflation or increasing costs, crime or gun violence and political extremism or polarization. Inflation is far and away Americans’ leading worry, as more than 60 percent named it as one of their top issues. Meanwhile, concern over crime and gun violence fell to 34 percent after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/over-40-percent-of-americans-now-rate-gun-violence-as-a-top-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching the low 40s in June</a>, while concerns about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-in-10-americans-named-political-polarization-as-a-top-issue-facing-the-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarization and extremism grew to 33 percent</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats and independents were especially likely to say abortion ranked as a top issue for the country.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independents included respondents who identified as “independent” or “something else,” or who skipped the question for party identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> The share of Democrats who named abortion more than doubled, from 13 percent in our previous wave to 27 percent in our latest wave, while the percentage of independents who mentioned abortion jumped from 8 percent to 17 percent. Republicans, too, were more worried about the issue, but their share only increased from 8 percent to 13 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">We asked these respondents why they listed abortion as a key issue, and many offered stark responses that showed the range of emotions that can accompany this issue — sometimes from unexpected sources. “Abortion is a personal topic for women. No one/no law should go against a woman's personal issue concerning this matter,” said a 60-year old Hispanic woman from New Jersey who identified as an independent but leaned Republican, while a 26-year old white woman in Colorado who identified as a Republican told us that “a nation that kills its babies cannot possibly survive as a strong, compassionate, cohesive nation.” A 20-year old Black man from California who identified as a Democrat wrote, “Women have less rights now than their mothers and grandmothers did.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, most Americans supported the underlying argument for Roe — that there is a right to privacy established in the Constitution; only not everyone agreed that it applied to abortion. Overall, 65 percent of Americans said the Constitution contains a right to privacy; only 10 percent said “no,” with almost no differences across party lines. However, a plurality (39 percent) said there was no legal right to abortion in the Constitution, while 30 percent said there was, a split largely driven by Republicans (70 percent of whom said there was no legal right to abortion).</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/overturning-roe-means-abortion-access-us-fivethirtyeight-85676655</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But the question now is where the fight over abortion will go next. For instance, the Dobbs decision <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/24/thomas-constitutional-rights-00042256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have opened the door</a> to future judicial rulings that threaten long-protected access to different forms of contraception. And some Republican-controlled state legislatures have even started <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/05/19/some-states-already-are-targeting-birth-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to restrict access to</a> different forms of birth control with legislation. Our poll found, however, that such bills might be a bridge too far for most Americans, as there is overwhelming support for legal access to common forms of contraception across party lines. Strikingly, around 90 percent of Americans said condoms and birth control pills should be legal in “all” or “most” cases, and 81 percent said the same of IUDs (intrauterine devices). And, there is very little difference in support for the legality of each of these contraceptives across party lines.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference in support between Democrats and Republicans is at most 2 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans of all stripes support most forms of birth control" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ln8zx/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="355" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Americans are more clearly divided over emergency contraception like Plan B pills, but 70 percent overall still said these methods should be legal, including 62 percent of Republicans, who were less supportive than Democrats or independents. But abortion itself brought out the sharpest partisan splits. At least 80 percent of Democrats said abortion in surgical or pill form should be legal, compared to about a third of Republicans. “I identify more with Republicans because the Democrats seem to be ‘everybody gets a free ride.’ But on this issue, I’m more with the Democratic Party,” said Debra W., an older white woman from Michigan. “Too many of [the Supreme Court justices] are too conservative. And they just are seeming to go back on a lot of rights.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, while Republicans were more likely to oppose abortion than Democrats or independents, they, like most Americans, rejected the idea of making abortion fully illegal, with no exceptions. This is notable because a number of almost entirely Republican-run states <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/health/abortion-bans-rape-incest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could end up with abortion bans</a> that contain no allowances in cases of rape, incest or when the mother’s life is in danger. But in our poll, 81 percent of respondents opposed such a comprehensive ban, including 74 percent of Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked whether they supported or opposed a series of items. We defined “support” as when respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported an item, and “oppose” as when respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” opposed an item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> “I feel like a lot of the conservative views are a bit more extreme than they were before,” said Soledad Ramos, a 33-year old Hispanic woman from Texas who identified as independent but leaned Democratic. “Regardless how it happened, [women] may end up in a situation where they may decide that abortion is the better option for them. And I feel like they should have the say to decide that.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some GOP-controlled states <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/29/abortion-state-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also looking to punish women</a> who seek abortions across state lines, yet 78 percent of respondents opposed making it illegal to cross state lines to obtain an abortion, including 73 percent of Republicans. And 76 percent overall opposed making it illegal to assist a woman seeking an abortion with money or transportation, including 61 percent of Republicans. More broadly, there just wasn’t much support for punishing those who violate laws against abortion, as only 18 percent of respondents supported criminally charging violators and having them face either jail time or a fine. By comparison, 13 percent supported them being charged with a misdemeanor and a fine, while 36 percent opposed any punishment at all (31 percent said they didn’t know).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans <a href="https://time.com/6191886/fetal-personhood-laws-roe-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also pushing forward</a> controversial fetal personhood legislation — laws that could <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/states-say-abortion-bans-dont-affect-ivf-providers-lawyers-worry-rcna35556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make in vitro fertilization illegal</a>. In our survey, we asked half our respondents whether <em>fetuses</em> should be given the same rights as children and adults, and the other half whether <em>fertilized eggs</em> should have those rights. Majorities opposed both proposals, but fetal personhood did receive a bit more support, especially among Republicans. Overall, 59 percent opposed making fetuses legal persons, while 36 percent supported the idea, including 66 percent of Republicans. By comparison, 62 percent opposed personhood for fertilized eggs, including 50 percent of Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond what states are doing to restrict or expand abortion access, there’s also the question of the issue’s impact on the 2022 midterm election. It’s early yet, but we’ve noticed a small trend in the Democrats’ direction in our generic ballot question among likely voters, not unlike that seen <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in some other recent polling</a>. Back in early May, Republicans led by 5 points among likely voters (40 percent to 35 percent), but the GOP edge shrank to 2 points in early June (40 percent to 38 percent), and in our latest wave Democrats actually led by 1 point (39 percent to 38 percent). Because the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll uses a panel, we’re talking about movement among largely the same group of voters, so this could be meaningful. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-court-dealt-big-blow-separation-church-state-85886797</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">However, we shouldn’t overstate the importance of this swing, as it’s only July and we know <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the generic ballot polling average tends to trend</a> toward the party not in the White House as we get closer to the election. Moreover, abortion (or any other issue, for that matter) doesn’t seem to have made people who weren’t likely to vote say they are <em>now </em>likely to vote. <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/majority-of-americans-think-supreme-court-overturning-roe-was-more-about-politics-than-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A lot of</a> coverage <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3543477-nearly-4-in-10-say-roe-v-wade-overturning-made-them-much-more-interested-in-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has cited polls</a> that ask respondents whether the Supreme Court’s decision has made them more likely to vote, but respondents who were already likely to vote could still answer “more likely” in such surveys, so those figures don’t tell us that much about potential increases in voter engagement. Meanwhile, in our survey, the share who said they were likely to vote has hardly changed across the three waves — and there’s been little change by party, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, while about 1 in 5 respondents cited abortion as a top issue, 3 in 5 named inflation or rising prices. Moreover, higher prices, particularly higher gas prices, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-cant-win-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often correspond</a> with abysmal presidential approval ratings, which, of course, usually align <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with worse midterm performances</a> by the president’s party. We didn’t ask about job approval, but President Biden’s favorability numbers remained poor: Thirty-three percent registered a favorable opinion of him, compared with 59 percent who held an unfavorable view.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Favorable opinions were those that were “very,” “somewhat” or “lean” favorable. Unfavorable opinions were those that were “very,” “somewhat” or “lean” unfavorable. Respondents were also given the option of “don’t know” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> Those numbers were somewhat better among likely voters (40 percent favorable, 59 percent unfavorable), but still quite negative for Biden. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, abortion has become a more pressing topic in the midterms, but the fundamental worry about rising prices and Biden’s low standing could still be a major boon to Republican fortunes in the fall.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In his <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/3535841-thomas-calls-for-overturning-precedents-on-contraceptives-lgbtq-rights/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/3535841-thomas-calls-for-overturning-precedents-on-contraceptives-lgbtq-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concurring opinion</a> in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he views not only abortion precedent as wrong but also precedents involving LGBTQ rights. Public opinion, however, is largely against restricting LGBTQ rights. Over the past few decades, these rights have steadily gained backing from the American public — for example, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for same-sex marriage has doubled</a> since the late 1990s. And laws intended to protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in jobs, <a href="https://adata.org/faq/what-are-public-accommodations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public accommodations</a> and housing garners the <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/americans-support-for-key-lgbtq-rights-continues-to-tick-upward/#page-section-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support of about 8 in 10 Americans</a>, including majorities of Republicans and white evangelicals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, however, policies curbing certain aspects of LGBTQ rights — particularly those pertaining to transgender people — have gained traction in state legislatures across the nation. A number of states have already implemented <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/nearly-240-anti-lgbtq-bills-filed-2022-far-targeting-trans-people-rcna20418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies affecting transgender Americans</a>, and more states are introducing similar measures. And despite widespread support for general nondiscrimination policies, many Americans actually <em>do</em> support restricting rights for transgender people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, the Public Religion Research Institute, where I’m the research director, found last year that <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/most-americans-support-pro-lgbtq-policies-but-are-more-divided-over-transgender-sports-and-bathroom-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47 percent of Americans favored “bathroom bills”</a> that would require transgender people to use the bathroom of their sex assigned at birth, not their gender identity.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll was conducted Aug. 9-30, 2021, and has a margin of error of +/- 1.86 percentage points. If respondents skipped a given question, they were excluded from its analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> Meanwhile, 52 percent of Americans said they were opposed to transgender boys’ participating in high school sports for their gender identity; 61 percent said the same of transgender girls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For some Americans — especially members of the LGBTQ community — supporting restrictive bathroom bills and opposing participation in sports of one’s gender identity are forms of discrimination and should be incompatible with broader support for nondiscrimination protections. Yet in that same survey from PRRI, we found that a considerable share of Americans held seemingly opposing views. Forty-six percent of Americans, for instance, said they both supported general nondiscrimination protections <em>and </em>opposed allowing transgender girls to participate in girls’ sports. Meanwhile, 37 percent supported nondiscrimination protections <em>and</em> opposed allowing transgender boys to participate in boys’ sports. Finally, 36 percent supported nondiscrimination protections <em>and </em>supported bathroom bills requiring transgender people to use the bathroom of their sex assigned at birth.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Who are these Americans with mixed views? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, a little bit of everyone. By partisanship, Republicans and independents are much more likely than Democrats to hold opposing views, or be “cross-pressured,” on this issue, but at least one-quarter of Democrats also fall into this cross-pressured category in each of the three situations described above.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cross-pressured opinions were most prominent among Americans age 50 to 64, with those 65 and older and those 30 to 49 being somewhat less likely to fall into this category. Americans age 18 to 29 were the least likely to be cross-pressured — although at least 30 percent of this age group fell into that category across all three situations. Americans with a college education were also less likely than those without a college education to be cross-pressured on the bathroom-use question, as were women compared with men on the issue of transgender girls participating in girls’ high school sports. Those who said they knew someone who is LGBTQ were also less likely to be cross-pressured on the bathroom-use question compared with those who do not know an LGBTQ person.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the exception of Hispanic Catholics, most Christian groups were considerably more likely than non-Christians or religiously affiliated Americans to be cross-pressured on nondiscrimination protections and transgender participation in sports. On nondiscrimination protections and bathroom restrictions, however, all Christian groups we surveyed, including Hispanic Catholics, were more cross-pressured than those who weren’t Christian or religiously affiliated at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In general, those who are less likely to be cross-pressured are more likely to support all three pro-LGBTQ-rights positions we asked about. That includes Democrats and young people across all three situations, and those with a college education or higher and women on some of the questions — although, notably, at least one-fourth of each of these groups were still cross-pressured.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These same patterns hold for just about every demographic and attitudinal comparison that analysts typically use to explain differences in opinion — many people remain cross-pressured, even those who are typically on the progressive end of the political spectrum. The policies and questions surrounding transgender rights are clearly not tapping into the same sense of fairness and anti-discrimination sentiment as the nondiscrimination-laws question. So, what is it tapping into?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The clearest picture emerges when we look at beliefs about gender. As with abortion, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-dividing-line-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the true dividing line</a> seems to have more to do with how people think about gender. Among those who feel strongly that there is a range of many genders (versus only two — a man and a woman),<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents selected whether they: 1) feel strongly that there is a range of many gender identities, 2) think there is a range of many gender identities but do not feel strongly about it, 3) think there are only two genders but do not feel strongly about it or 4) feel strongly that there are only two genders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> just 20 percent are cross-pressured when it comes to transgender girls’ participation in sports, and that share drops to 13 percent for transgender boys’ participation. Meanwhile, 25 percent support general nondiscrimination laws and bathroom restrictions. These are relatively low rates of cross-pressured responses compared with those who think there are only two genders, regardless of whether they feel strongly about that belief. And among those who feel strongly that there are only two genders, more than half are cross-pressured on these questions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s important to remember that opinions on these issues can be complex — and genuinely cross-pressured. Sometimes people haven’t thought much about how these issues connect — meaning, it does not occur to them that bathroom bills or rules about sports participation could be discriminatory. Other times people have thought about these issues and still believe they are not discriminatory at their core. Either way, opinion on LGBTQ rights — as with everything — is more nuanced and complex than a single general survey question can show.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">This past Supreme Court term featured the sharpest ideological divide in decades, with 21 percent of rulings seeing justices nominated by presidents of one party vote one way and justices nominated by presidents of the other party vote the opposite way. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew analyzes the rightward direction of the court this term and what the majority conservative court could have in store in the future. Then they break down the Democrats’ response and how the party could try to tip the balance of the court or limit the power of the justices.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But first the crew kicks off this SCOTUS-focused podcast by discussing a recent <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394103/confidence-supreme-court-sinks-historic-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll</a> that found American confidence in the Supreme Court at a 50-year low. The poll has inspired political commentators to argue that the court is putting its legitimacy in danger by straying too far from national public opinion.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Mike Jensen keeps a database of bad guys. As a senior researcher at the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), part of Jensen’s job is to identify violent events that occur in the U.S. and investigate whether the people involved have any ties to extremism. If they do, he adds them to his database. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In what he calls a “very active” year, Jensen says he might end up adding 300 individuals to the database. But after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Jensen’s database grew dramatically. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We have three times that on one day that potentially qualify,” Jensen said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the attack on the Capitol, Jensen started putting together a social network consisting of individuals who had been charged in relation to Jan. 6 and had existing ties to extremist organizations. He found many of the defendants had connections to extremist groups prior to Jan. 6, and that these groups were connected to one another. Relationships between defendants and a shared belief in the Big Lie forged new connections between these disparate groups. It’s not that your local Proud Boys chapter is regularly planning a bowling night with the neighborhood sovereign citizens collective. But when a lie about a stolen election aligns with their respective ideologies, they’ll be sure to show up in Washington, D.C., to riot together. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than 800 individuals</a> have been charged in relation to the Jan. 6 attack. To identify who had existing ties to extremist organizations, Jensen analyzed court filings, news reports and social media posts. He found roughly a third of those charged had preexisting ties to extremist groups<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of June 3, 2022. Jensen identified defendants as having extremist ties if they were a member of, self-identified as a member of, or praised an extremist group. He coded defendants as members if there was evidence that they had gone through a group’s established membership process, such as completing an application or paying dues. He coded defendants as praising or self-identifying with an extremist group if there was insufficient evidence that they had gone through the membership process despite expressing interest in joining; if the group or movement they praised does not have a membership process (like QAnon); or if they promoted the views of (i.e., publicly praised) the group. Public praise included publicly sharing or wearing the signs, symbols or slogans of a group or movement; publicly posting a movement’s ideology while attributing the ideas to said ideology; or sharing photos (including selfies) with group leaders or members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> and nearly one in five also had verifiable contact with <em>other</em> defendants prior to Jan. 6. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A photo of a defendant on social media sporting a Proud Boys T-shirt (a group that has a formalized membership) wasn’t enough to consider them a member of that group, nor was simply retweeting or liking a post from a member of that group, according to Jensen. He looked for more substantial connections, such as direct messages, posting on each other’s social media pages, or having a conversation in the comments or replies of social media posts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jensen’s data reveals a tangled web of individuals with connections to other defendants, as well as to a number of extremist groups including the Proud Boys (<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a far-right extremist group</a> that is known for street violence and boasting about “Western chauvinism”), the Oath Keepers (a <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/oath-keepers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far-right anti-government militia</a>) and QAnon, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/qanon-has-become-the-cult-that-cries-wolf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the wide-ranging conspiracy theory</a> alleging that major Democrats and Hollywood figures are part of a secret cabal of Satanic pedophiles. </p>

You would not have this coalition force. But on Jan. 6, what you saw is this perfect storm that brought together each of those distinct, disparate groups and movements, to act as one cohesive group in engaging in these actions,” said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. Certain ideology — like the unfounded belief that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump — can thread together otherwise disparate groups of extremists on the right, and can mobilize members of these groups to act collectively. When this happens, a single extremist organization can reach beyond its small sphere of influence, and it can lead to deadly results, as we saw on Jan. 6. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here’s what it looks like when all the extremist defendants’ connections are visible:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1410" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-2.png?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-2.png?w=2048 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1666" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-2-mob.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-2-mob.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-2-mob.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-2-mob.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In this database, Jensen has documented over 750 unique connections between defendants and between defendants and various groups. The resulting network is densely filled with connections between national leaders and lesser-known members of extremist groups. To understand how to parse it, let’s consider a couple of examples. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the time of the Jan. 6 attack, Enrique Tarrio was the national leader of the Proud Boys and Stewart Rhodes was the leader of the Oath Keepers. Unsurprisingly, these two individuals are found basically at the center of the web. Both the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers had a large presence on Jan. 6, and the groups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/us/politics/trump-flynn-stone-jan-6-extremist.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been accused</a> of plotting and coordinating ahead of the attack. Though Tarrio wasn’t at the Capitol on Jan. 6, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22053617-tarrio-et-al-superseding-indictment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he is alleged to have been coordinating</a> the Proud Boys movements from Baltimore, and to have helped plan the attack ahead of time. Both Rhodes and Tarrio were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/06/tarrio-proud-boys-seditious-conpiracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently charged with seditious conspiracy</a> (among other charges), a federal charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison. We reached out to Rhodes’s and Tarrio’s lawyers. Rhodes’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. Tarrio’s lawyer, Nayib Hassan, called the notion that the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers were connected a “fictious lie” and referred to a motion filed in the case disputing claims that the two organizations coordinated ahead of the attack. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/happen-jan-hearings-change-minds-85225807</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">In the chart below, you can see how Tarrio and Rhodes link the different points in the web together. Through dozens of other defendants from whom they are separated by one or two degrees, Tarrio and Rhodes connect almost three-quarters of the known extremist organizations that were present on Jan. 6:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1410" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-3.png?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-3.png?w=2048 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1510" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-3-mob.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-3-mob.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-3-mob.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-3-mob.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not only the leaders of national right-wing extremist groups who were heavily connected prior to the attack. Let’s highlight two other individuals: Dominic Pezzola and Charles Donohoe. Both Pezzola — a 45-year-old small business owner from Rochester, New York — and Donohoe — a 34-year-old handyman from the suburbs outside Winston-Salem, North Carolina — were members of the Proud Boys. At the time of the attack, Donohoe was a chapter president in North Carolina, while Pezzola was a somewhat new but active member in New York. Though not national figures, both men were allegedly members of the “Ministry of Self Defense,” or MOSD — a chapter of the Proud Boys’ inner circle that planned national rallies. According to court filings, Donohoe was also a member of the MOSD Leaders Group, a chat group that was allegedly created by Tarrio where members of MOSD planned the Proud Boys participation on Jan. 6. Donohoe also has a connection to QAnon — he <a href="https://www.fayobserver.com/story/news/2020/08/29/fayetteville-downtown-businesses-advised-close-early-before-march/5668323002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided security</a> for a QAnon “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/qanons-obsession-with-savethechildren-is-making-it-harder-to-save-kids-from-traffickers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save the children</a>” rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in August 2020.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/latest-jan-hearing-testimony-affect-midterm-elections-86274149</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Largely through their membership in these chat groups, even these lower-level Proud Boys end up deeply integrated into this web. Donohoe has direct contact with six other named defendants, while Pezzola has direct contact with eight others.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including one another. Calculated as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Degree_centrality" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;degree&lt;/a&gt;, which is the number of individuals that Jensen confirmed a person interacted with directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> While Donohoe has many connections with other groups and quite a few direct connections to other defendants, Pezzola is one of the main links between highly connected defendants and defendants who have relatively few connections.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculated as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;betweenness centrality&lt;/a&gt;, the number of shortest paths between everyone in the network that includes the person of interest. Betweenness can be interpreted as how many indirect connections exist because a specific person links them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>19</sup></a> </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1410" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-4.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-4.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-4.png?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-4.png?w=2048 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1530" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-4-mob.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-4-mob.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-4-mob.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fuong.rogers.J6-SOCIAL-NETWORK-4-mob.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Think of it like a chain of people holding hands. On one end, you have the Proud Boys, and on the other end, you have the Oath Keepers. In the middle of that chain is Pezzola, one of the links connecting the two groups. We reached out to the lawyers for both Pezzola (who has pleaded not guilty) and Donohoe (who has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/leader-north-carolina-chapter-proud-boys-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-and-assault-charges-jan-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded guilty</a>). Pezzola’s lawyer did not respond to follow-up requests for an interview. Donohoe’s lawyer, Ira Knight, sent a statement: “Charlie regrets his actions, and is remorseful for the conduct that led to these charges. He has accepted responsibility for his wrongs, and is prepared to accept the consequences.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The attack on the Capitol was the culmination of shared ideology — in this case, the belief in Trump’s false claims of a stolen election — mobilizing disparate groups into action. Soon after the attack on the Capitol, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/24/980754255/new-evidence-points-to-coordination-among-extremist-groups-ahead-of-capitol-riot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prosecutors claimed</a> that extremist groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers had coordinated ahead of Jan. 6. The alleged coordination and the relationships captured in Jensen’s data demonstrate how that shared ideology forged new connections between these groups.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-agree-disagree-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85543538</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s really narratives that the bigger, radicalizing, conspiratorial networks can capitalize on at any given moment to facilitate offline organizing,” said Samantha Kutner, a researcher at the Khalifa Ihler Institute, a Sweden-based think tank that focuses on ending extremism worldwide. Kutner has conducted extensive research on the Proud Boys.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jensen said he has a list of individuals with extremist ties who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 but aren’t in his database yet because they haven’t been formally charged. If and when that happens, he says the web will only become more entangled. What’s most troubling about this web, he said, is that the kind of ideas that link and can mobilize these groups are becoming more commonplace. He said it’s the popularization of those ideas that should be raising alarm bells, more so than any individual group’s actions or organization.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re in an environment right now in this country where we are so politically divided and polarized that almost everything now seems like a mobilizing event,” Jensen said. “I think we’re going to see more of that.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow week of polling over the holiday weekend</a> — happy birthday, USA — and the FiveThirtyEight midterm election forecast hasn’t changed much since we launched it last week. Republicans have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an 86 percent chance of winning control of the House in November</a> according to the Deluxe version of our model. But the Senate is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much closer to a toss-up</a>, with Republicans at a 53 percent chance of a takeover. Both of those numbers are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty much the same as when we launched the model</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we’ve seen some movement toward Democrats on the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they would support in an election. Democrats now trail Republicans by 1.6 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight average. That compares with a 2.3-point deficit on June 24, when the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health</a> that it would overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why make a huge deal of the difference between 2.3 points and 1.6 points? Well, I’m not making a <em>huge</em> deal of it. But because of the way our polling average is designed, it’s a bigger deal than it might seem at first glance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The truth is, when you design any sort of model, it’s rarely as simple as just following the data. Rather, you have a lot of choices to make. One of the most important ones is how sensitive a model or an average is to <em>new</em> data. It’s obviously possible to err in either direction. There’s a lot of noise in polling averages, and you don’t want a model that does acrobatics in response to every new poll, especially when it’s still many months out from the election and most voters are thinking more about what kind of meat to grill than about whom to elect to Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But polls can and do change in response to big news, and Roe being overturned — probably the most well-known Supreme Court decision of the past 50 years — is big news.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Usually, the generic ballot is a noisy measure, and if you know nothing about what’s causing the changes, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-a-new-less-volatile-version-of-our-generic-ballot-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best empirical strategy is to be quite conservative</a> in updating the average. If the polls move by several points and there’s no real underlying cause, it’s <em>probably</em> just noise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After all, most people — even most people who vote in congressional elections — are not following the news intensely on a day-to-day basis. Cable news ratings, for instance, reflect a <em>tiny</em> fraction of the American population: The most-watched cable news program is seen by something like <a href="https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/here-are-the-top-rated-cable-news-shows-for-q2-2022/510090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 percent of Americans on a typical night</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, in figuring out whether shifts in a polling average represent signal or noise, the model averages out <em>lots</em> of times when there’s nothing much going on and a <em>few</em> times when there is. The safe bet is usually “probably mostly noise, awaiting more evidence of signal.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But given that we do have a huge story on our hands, let’s do a direct before-and-after comparison. Six pollsters<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouGov has released polls in partnership with both Yahoo News and The Economist, but because of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1544674762332557313?s=20&amp;amp;t=svq7hp1sSmWNfnH0sWGzvw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;technical issue with the YouGov/Economist polls&lt;/a&gt;, we’re using only the Yahoo News version here. Note, however, that the Economist polls have also shown a shift toward Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a> have released generic ballot polls both before and after the Dobbs decision.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By “after,” we mean that the poll went into the field on June 24 or later, and by “before,” we mean that the poll went into the field between May 15 and June 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> All six of those polling firms have shown a shift toward Democrats. On average, Democrats trailed by 1.3 points in the pre-Dobbs version of these polls but led by 1.5 points in the most recent ones, a shift of almost 3 points toward the party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">If this persists, then our generic ballot average — and also our midterm model — will eventually catch up and move toward Democrats. Of course, that might not happen. The change <em>could</em> still be a statistical quirk. Or it could be temporary, an <a href="https://agadjanianpolitics.wordpress.com/2017/07/02/possible-evidence-of-differential-partisan-nonresponse-in-trump-approval-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artifact of partisan nonresponse bias</a>. That is, if Democrats are more engaged than Republicans by news of the Supreme Court’s decision — and there’s <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3537982-democrats-more-likely-to-vote-in-midterms-after-abortion-ruling-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence to suggest they are</a> — they may be more likely to respond to polls for some period of time, at least until the next news story takes hold. Then again, if Democrats are more motivated than Republicans to <em>vote</em> by the decision, that could help them in a real way in November, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bottom line: Most of the time, polling averages are exceptionally useful, but be wary of using them in ways in which they weren’t intended. The FiveThirtyEight generic ballot polling average is designed<em> </em>to be conservative and slow-moving and not really equipped to deal with breaking-news developments.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-makes-our-new-2020-democratic-primary-polling-averages-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;experimented with techniques&lt;/a&gt; in our presidential polling averages that allow them to move rapidly in response to pre-scheduled news events such as conventions and debates, but there’s nothing like that for the generic ballot yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>22</sup></a> That our generic ballot polling average is steady in reaction to the news doesn’t really prove anything either way, then. But because of the Dobbs decision, there may be some electoral upside for Democrats beyond what our model currently shows.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are feeling uneasy, and it’s hard to blame them. The things they want to change — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/business/economy/inflation-economy-recession.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/11/this-covid-wave-might-be-the-start-of-our-new-normal-experts-say.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 case numbers</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/democrats-crime-gun-violence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising violent crime</a> in some cities — seem more and more intractable. There was one big, abrupt shift in American life at the end of June, when the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned the constitutional right to abortion</a>. But that wasn’t a change <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/07/06/majority-of-public-disapproves-of-supreme-courts-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Americans wanted</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This sense of dissatisfaction showed up in <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394283/confidence-institutions-down-average-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent poll from Gallup</a>, which asked Americans how much confidence they have in various institutions. The survey found that since last June, when Gallup last asked this set of questions, Americans’ confidence in almost every institution has dropped. In the poll, which was conducted before the justices released their decision on abortion but after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a draft of the opinion leaked</a>, the biggest shifts were for the presidency, which saw a 15-percentage-point drop, and the Supreme Court, which saw an 11-point drop. But overall, the national mood is sour. Americans’ average confidence in 14 of the institutions that Gallup asked about was only at 27 percent — the lowest point since Gallup began the survey in 1979.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans' trust in major institutions reaches a new low" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/11amQ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="402" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Americans aren’t just cynical about their political institutions. In <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup’s trends</a>, you can see more and more disillusionment with pretty much every major institution. Some of these shifts are hard to blame on politics — confidence in banks, for instance, fell dramatically during the Great Recession. But experts told me that they’re also the result of increasing partisan polarization and a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/10/12/conservatives-have-long-stoked-distrust-government-now-were-paying-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades-long effort</a> by the Republican Party to sow distrust in a wide range of government institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic may have also reinforced Americans’ sense that the government won’t be there for them in times of crisis: According to <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_070522/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Monmouth University poll</a> conducted from June 23-27, 57 percent of Americans said that the actions of the federal government over the past six months have hurt their family regarding the issue most important to them, up from 34 percent in July 2021 and 46 percent in December.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This broad loss of faith in the institutions that organize our society is dangerous, experts say — and it may be hard to reverse. “Despite the political polarization, both sides feel like they’re losing,” said <a href="https://fletcher.tufts.edu/people/faculty/daniel-drezner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Drezner</a>, a professor of international politics at Tufts University. “And populaces and countries that are pessimistic about the future often end up doing really bad things.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-courts-approval-rating-dropping-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85385158</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The idea that the government doesn’t work for people — and therefore, we should have less of it — can be traced back decades, to the political campaigns of former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Those messages fed a sense of cynicism that was already growing, according to <a href="https://umaine.edu/polisci/faculty-and-staff/amy-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Fried</a>, a political science professor at the University of Maine who has studied the history of political mistrust. “Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there are all of these upheavals — Watergate, the Vietnam War, riots, assassinations,” she said. But politicians — mostly Republicans — have since amplified Americans’ doubts by continuing to talk about government overreach and corruption. Former President Donald Trump dialed up these messages, attacking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-convention-further-alienates-wall-street-and-its-money-players/2016/07/19/5872ade8-4dd2-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banks</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/18/why-is-donald-trump-attacking-the-us-intelligence-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">country’s</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42360540" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intelligence agencies</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-longstanding-history-calling-elections-rigged-doesnt-results/story?id=74126926" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its election system</a> during his campaigns and presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Political allegiances increasingly shape the way Americans view all kinds of institutions, too. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There are the obvious ones</a> — Democrats have more confidence in the presidency when a Democrat is in the White House, Republicans have more confidence in Congress when the GOP is in control — but trust in the medical system, organized religion and public schools are all shaped by partisanship too. According to Gallup, between 2021 and 2022, Republicans’ confidence in the military fell from 81 percent to 71 percent — a shift that Drezner said could be due to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/31/majority-of-u-s-public-favors-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-biden-criticized-for-his-handling-of-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">botched withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer</a>, or to a general sense among some conservative voters that even the military can’t be trusted under a Democratic president. “The culture wars have become so heavily partisan that they now spill over into institutions that previously were thought of as not partisan at all,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-the-stimulus-checks-a-mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-still-doesnt-know-how-to-track-a-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public health</a> responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, meanwhile, may have convinced more Americans that the government simply doesn’t know what it’s doing. <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/c/carman_katherine_grace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Carman</a>, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, was one of the authors of <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA112-7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2020 report</a> that examined why Americans trust institutions in the first place. “Competence and honesty — these are really important factors that contribute to trust,” she said. “We ask the government to make and enforce laws and policy for us. So we need them to be truthful about the information they’re providing. And we want them to have the skills and knowledge to actually do those things.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-trust-the-cdc-on-covid-19-trump-not-so-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, Americans said they generally trusted the government to handle the crisis and share accurate information about it. Their confidence in Trump’s response to the pandemic <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-coronavirus/trumps-handling-of-coronavirus-pandemic-hits-record-low-approval-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN26T3OF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eroded over the remaining year</a>, but when Biden came into office, approval of his handling of the pandemic was pretty high. Now, though, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s approval tracker for presidents' COVID-19 response</a>, 49 percent of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of the pandemic and 43 percent disapprove.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> And <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/biden-starts-year-two-with-diminished-public-support-and-a-daunting-list-of-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Pew Research Center poll</a> from earlier this year found that a declining share of Americans are confident that Biden is able to handle the public health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and that he has good judgment on economic policy, reflecting widespread public concern about rising inflation and a possible recession.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These shifts are happening among Americans of all political stripes, although to different degrees. The Gallup poll found that Democrats’ confidence in the institution of the presidency fell from 69 percent in 2021 to 51 percent this year — an alarming drop among members of Biden’s own party. That tracks, overall, with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-have-been-souring-on-biden-since-last-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a broader erosion in Biden’s support</a> among Democrats, many of whom are disappointed about his administration’s lack of policy achievements and increasingly frustrated about rising costs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The danger, Carman said, is that Americans’ trust in institutions doesn’t just decline — mistrust starts to grow. Her report found that there was already active mistrust of the government and media. “I think that’s particularly worrisome,” she said. “Active distrust means not only do you think they’re not always honest — maybe they lie to you. Maybe they’re trying to hurt you.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Widespread distrust can be dangerous. If people don’t trust government institutions, they’ll be more likely to believe that elections are untrustworthy too. Drezner said that as distrust increases, people are more likely to act in disruptive or even violent ways, like with the Jan. 6 insurrection. If Americans believe the institutions around them are failing, he said, they “might be tempted to take a risky gamble that puts you back to where you used to be.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s a bleak outlook. But Americans are in a bleak mood. Drezner said that if some of the trends that are sowing deeper distrust turn around — say, the pandemic fades into the background and inflation begins to abate — people might start to feel better about the government too. But for now, they’re not feeling happy about most of the institutions that order society — and that could be bad for democracy.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A majority of Americans said the second COVID-19 booster definitely (40 percent) or probably (19 percent) should be available to all adults, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2022/07/06/0048e/1">according to a YouGov poll</a> conducted Wednesday. This includes 83 percent of Democrats but only 42 percent of Republicans. Views didn’t vary too much by age, although older Americans were more likely to feel strongly that the second booster should be available to more people: 47 percent of those ages 65 and over believed everyone should “definitely” have the option, versus only 34 percent of those between the ages of 18-29. At present, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html">CDC guidelines</a> suggest the second booster for only immunocompromised people 12 and older as well as all adults 50 and older. </li><li>Sixty-three percent of Americans were worried about their individual financial outlook in the short-term future, <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/medicare-negotiation-tackling-price-gouging-taxing-the-wealthy-seen-as-effective-to-fight-inflation/">according to a June 23-27 survey from Navigator Research</a>. White Americans (69 percent) appeared to be the most concerned, although Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders weren’t far behind (64 percent). Meanwhile, a smaller share of Hispanic Americans (51 percent) and Black Americans (44 percent) reported feeling uneasy in this regard. This split among racial and ethnic groups is consistent among Americans when it comes to their overall opinions on the current economy: White Americans (83 percent) expressed the most pessimism about the economy, followed by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (79 percent), Hispanic Americans (68 percent) and Black Americans (61 percent). </li><li>With primaries well underway and an increasing spotlight on November’s midterm elections, just over half of Americans (53 percent) wanted political fundraising emails to count as spam, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/07/06/0048e/3">per a YouGov survey</a> conducted this week. More than Democrats and Republicans, independents drove the result, with 62 percent saying they wanted this sort of email classified as spam. </li><li>Support for the congressional hearings on the Jan. 6 insurrection rose over the past month, per <a href="https://projectdefenddemocracy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/American-Public-Opinion_-January-6-and-Efforts-to-Thwart-Will-of-American-Voters.pdf">research recently published by the Defend Democracy Project</a>, which studied one poll conducted May 13-16 by Politico/Morning Consult and another conducted June 11-19 by Lake Research Partners/Research Collaborative/ASO Communications. Sixty-three percent of Americans were in favor of the hearings in June (shortly after they began), up from 55 percent in May. That increase reflects considerably more support from independents — 53 percent in May versus 73 percent in June. Democratic support for the hearings was 94 percent in June, whereas Republican support was just 30 percent.</li><li>A majority of Democrats (80 percent) said the EPA should have the ability to create environmental protections even if those protections harmed industries, according to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/07/01/prioritize-environment-economy-splits-americans">a survey from The Economist/YouGov</a> published last week. But that number drops to 48 percent among independents and just 28 percent among Republicans.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Talking with voters about reproductive health issues, including abortion access, isn’t new for <a href="https://www.womenengaged.org/staff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malika Redmond</a>, the co-founder and CEO of Women Engaged, an Atlanta-based group that focuses on Black voter engagement. Not long after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973, access to reproductive care was harmed by the passage of the Hyde Amendment, which <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned the use of federal funds for most abortions</a>. This, Redmond told me, disproportionately impacted women and young people from perpetually disenfranchised and rural communities, particularly Black women and other women and young adults of color.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Georgia <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was among 33 states</a> that banned the use of state Medicaid funds for abortions, following federal guidance. And, by 2017, some <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/factsheet/sfaa-ga.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95 percent of counties in Georgia</a> had no clinics that provided abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Fifty-five percent of women in Georgia lived in these counties. The situation further deteriorated in 2019, when Gov. Brian Kemp signed a controversial bill that would effectively ban most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. At that point, Redmond said, her group started hearing more from people who wanted to understand the fate of reproductive health care in Georgia. That question is once again on the minds of Black voters in Georgia, as the Supreme Court has overturned Roe, and that six-week ban, which was <a href="https://time.com/5866714/georgia-heartbeat-abortion-law-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down by the courts in 2020,</a><em> </em>is now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/24/abortion-state-laws-criminalization-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to go into effect soon</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, access to reproductive health care, and the impact that its loss will have on people’s everyday lives, was always top of mind not just for Georgia’s Black voters, but also for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-women-south-bracing-roes-fall-decades-rcna27097" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black voters across the U.S.</a> It’s why, as we head into this fall’s midterms, <a href="https://seattlemedium.com/roe-decision-could-spur-massive-voter-turnout-during-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of pro-Black advocacy groups</a> have said that Black voters might view November’s midterm elections as a referendum on abortion access — a wish that some <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-democrats-aim-to-make-abortion-rights-a-unifying-midterm-message/T7NZXR7O5BBPVMHAYMXTQMZ5IM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic politicians are banking on</a>, too. But according to <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/gillespie-andra.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andra Gillespie</a>, a professor of political science at Emory University, “[I]t’s hard to say that Black voters are single-issue abortion voters. I think it’ll be couched in a mix of other things important to them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If history has taught us anything, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/black-and-hispanic-people-have-the-most-to-lose-if-roe-is-overturned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is that Black people</a>, particularly those who are poor, will be among the biggest sufferers in a post-Roe world despite some anti-abortion advocates claiming that banning abortion <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/19/16906928/black-anti-abortion-movement-yoruba-richen-medical-racism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be <em>good</em> for Black people</a>. But it’s unclear whether Black voters will prioritize Roe over issues like <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-8d17-dd36-a38c-cf5faa320000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising prices, the economy or police violence</a>. Moreover, it might be harder for Black voters across the nation to discuss one-size-fits-all abortion policies without first acknowledging how their communities have been disproportionally hurt by things like <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/black-disparities-youth-incarceration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high youth incarceration rates</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased maternal mortality rates</a> and a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unequal-opportunity-race-and-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of educational opportunities</a> for their children.  </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/overturning-roe-means-abortion-access-us-fivethirtyeight-85676655</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">“I think race-related issues are far more existential for African Americans, and they’re going to emphasize those issues and decisions,” Gillespie told me. “They’re going to have to figure out how to make peace with how their views on those issues fits with their overall views on abortion access.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least when it comes to support for abortion rights and access, though, some polls suggest that Black voters are more supportive than white voters, said <a href="https://twitter.com/teemoneyusa?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tresa Undem</a>, a co-founder of the nonpartisan research firm PerryUndem. In a <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PerryUndem-Abortion-Public-Opinion-Survey-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February survey</a> of registered voters, her firm found that Black voters (58 percent) were among the most likely to support a candidate who supports abortion access. Moreover, at 79 percent, Black voters were the racial group <em>most</em> likely to say they did not<em> </em>want to see Roe overturned. (Asian American and Pacific Islander voters came in second at 75 percent, and just 60 percent of white voters said the same.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-court-dealt-big-blow-separation-church-state-85886797</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">This is in line with other polling that has found Black voters becoming more<em> </em>liberal on abortion — even if they’re not naming it as their top policy issue. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/318932/black-americans-abortion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> survey conducted between 2017 and 2020 found that 46 percent of Black Americans said that abortion was “morally acceptable” — up from 31 percent who said the same between 2001 and 2007; non-Black racial groups that Gallup surveyed reported a slight change in how they felt about abortion (41 percent from 2001 to 2007, to 43 percent from 2017 to 2020). And another poll from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/chart/views-on-abortion-by-race-and-ethnicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a> published in May found that a greater share of Black adults (67 percent) than Hispanic and white adults (58 and 57 percent, respectively) thought abortion should be legal in all or most cases. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On their face, these numbers suggest that abortion access — or a lack thereof — might motivate Black voters to turn out. After all, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-americans-stand-on-abortion-in-5-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the share of women getting abortions</a> who is nonwhite (including Black women) <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also steadily grown</a> since the 1970s. But there are plenty of reasons why it won’t be a standalone issue for them. Namely, for many Black people, the debate over abortion access is inextricably tied to race — and access to equal opportunities once a child is born — in ways that white communities seldom face. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, pregnant Black people face worse health outcomes, such as higher <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/disparities-pregnancy-related-deaths/infographic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal and infant mortality</a> rates, which inevitably shape how abortion access is discussed in Black communities. A 2021 <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/58/6/2019/265968/The-Pregnancy-Related-Mortality-Impact-of-a-Total" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study from Duke University</a>, for example, suggested that a hypothetical total abortion ban would increase deaths the most among Black people the most compared to other racial groups. The study estimated that pregnancy-related deaths among Black people would increase by 33 percent in the years following an abortion ban, compared with a 21 percent increase for the overall population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But abortion access in Black communities isn’t just tied to health outcomes; it’s often tied to things like the quality of schools in predominately Black areas, racial disparities in health care or even the criminal justice system. That February PerryUndem survey found, for example, that Black voters connected abortion rights and access to control over one’s body (72 percent), women’s rights (72 percent) and health care (67 percent). A plurality of Black respondents — 47 percent — tied abortion access to racial justice, more than any other demographic group surveyed. And, of course, underlying the debate regarding Roe is the question of what banning abortions means for Black children. Rallying cries for change such as “Black Lives Matter,” a motto and movement created to highlight the abuses that Black people face at the hands of police officers, confronts difficult questions about the safety of both Black people and the children they may be forced to conceive. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“At its core, this issue for voters is about power and control over one’s own body. Given our nation’s history, I think Black voters across political ideology are more attuned than white people to threats to bodily autonomy,” Undem said. She added that her research has found that Black voters and people of color are more likely to see systemic factors affecting abortion access — because abortion access is about access to resources and opportunities to raise healthy children. As Undem told me, Black voters and people of color often see a lack of abortion access as “forcing people to have children, but not providing access to resources that are required, like affordable child care.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, losing access to safe abortions isn’t the only thing Black voters have to worry about. The Supreme Court may soon rule on a number of cases that could further strip away civil rights. Earlier this year, the high court agreed to decide <a href="https://ncpolicywatch.com/2022/03/31/upcoming-u-s-supreme-court-cases-could-curb-colleges-use-of-affirmative-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether race-based admissions programs</a> are lawful, raising questions about the future of affirmative action in higher education. The court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also considering a challenge</a> to Alabama’s congressional map which argues that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — one of the most important safeguards against racial discrimination in elections — requires a second seat in which Black voters can elect the candidate of their choice. If that law is weakened, our elections would lose one of their biggest protections against racial discrimination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, it’s hard to conclude that Roe will be the sole motivating factor bringing Black voters to the polls this fall. That’s because, as Redmond and Gillespie told me, Black voters, like all racial voting blocs, are neither a monolith nor single-issue voters. But it’s also possible that Roe’s fate brings more voters to the polls <em>because </em>it’s wrapped up in a number of racial and economic justice issues that Black communities also care about. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Nobody wants any rights to be taken,” Redmond said, adding that issues like abortion access are important, but wrapped “inside of a set of civil and human rights issues” that are key to ensuring Black Americans’ safety, as well as economic and racial justice. “These are all key to Black communities thriving.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Do state courts have the power to interpret their own state constitutions? The Supreme Court could be poised to say “no” — at least when it comes to redistricting and election law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/06/justices-will-hear-case-that-tests-power-of-state-legislatures-to-set-rules-for-federal-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to hear</a> the case Moore v. Harper in the coming fall term. In that case, Republican legislators in North Carolina are asking the court to overturn the <em>state</em> Supreme Court’s decision to throw out their <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/north-carolina-republicans-passed-a-heavily-skewed-congressional-map-how-will-the-courts-respond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gerrymandered congressional map</a> and impose <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the court’s own</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Their argument rests on an extreme reading of the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elections clause</a> of the U.S. Constitution that <a href="https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5885&amp;context=flr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posits</a> that only state legislatures and Congress have the authority to decide how federal elections are run. Under this school of thought, known as the “<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent state legislature</a>” theory, state courts would no longer be able to intervene — even when a legislature violated the state’s constitution, as was found to be the case in North Carolina.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The independent state legislature theory is <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer than 25 years old</a>, and for most of its life, it’s been relegated to the fringes of academia. But it was widely promoted by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/05/20/ginni-thomas-arizona-election-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump and his allies</a> as <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4041062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they attempted</a> to first undermine — <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-pennsylvania-suit-now-suggests-legislature-pick-winner-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and</a> then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/us/politics/john-eastman-trump-2020-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn</a> — the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And several Supreme Court justices have already suggested that they’re on board with the theory. During litigation over election laws in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/20-542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20a66_new_m6io.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a> in 2020, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch endorsed some version of the idea that state legislatures should have nearly unfettered power over how federal elections are run, and earlier this year, they said in an emergency-docket ruling that they would have <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a455_5if6.pdf#page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled in favor</a> of the North Carolina legislature.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-courts-approval-rating-dropping-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85385158</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">If the Supreme Court sides with North Carolina Republicans in this case, it would have massive implications for election law. Depending on how the court rules, state courts might no longer be allowed to strike down legislatures’ proposed congressional maps for being gerrymandered. And if this happens, the way American elections are conducted would change in dramatic and destabilizing ways. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/experts/thomas-wolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Wolf</a>, deputy director of the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program, said ruling for the North Carolina Legislature would be “stepping into an arrangement of election law that has never governed the country.” An extreme embrace of the theory by the Supreme Court would hand legislatures power over every aspect of how federal elections are run, to the exclusion of not only state courts but also possibly other state actors like governors and election administrators. “It would be a voter suppressor’s fever dream,” Wolf said.</p>



<h2><strong>Partisan gerrymandering could get much more extreme</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">First and foremost, if North Carolina Republicans prevail at the Supreme Court, state courts would lose some of their power to curtail gerrymandering — or maybe all of it. If the court accepts the independent state legislature theory but rules narrowly, it could allow state courts to overturn maps but not redraw them, according to <a href="https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/stephen-i-vladeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Vladeck</a>, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “The idea is that there are certain things state courts can’t do,” Vladeck said. “So a state court could look at the legislature’s map and say, ‘Nope, try again.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But several more extreme paths are possible too. One option is that state courts might be barred from overturning maps based on vague sections of their state constitutions — like an equal protection clause — which would hamstring their ability to intervene in many states. Or the Supreme Court might simply rule that state courts can’t get involved in partisan gerrymandering disputes at all. That would directly contradict a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 ruling</a> where the court’s Republican appointees said that federal courts couldn’t hear challenges to partisan gerrymandering,<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal courts still have the ability to throw out maps that are racially gerrymandered, but &lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/merrill-v-milligan-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;another case&lt;/a&gt; pending before the Supreme Court, regarding the Voting Rights Act, threatens to &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;undermine those protections as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>26</sup></a> but they explicitly noted that state courts were still free to intervene. But the court is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-partisan-divide-hasnt-been-this-sharp-in-generations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more conservative than it was then</a>, which means there might be a majority to turn around and limit state courts’ power.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could mean a lot more work for the federal courts — exactly the kind of work that the justices said three years ago that they <em>didn’t</em> want federal judges to be doing. But it would also likely result in much more aggressive and unfair gerrymanders. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/final-ish-map-congressional-districts-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85543675</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past year, state courts have struck down congressional maps in not only North Carolina but also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/25/maryland-congressional-map-thrown-out-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ohios-overturned-congressional-map-shows-how-lawsuits-might-scramble-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a>. If all of those rulings are invalidated, it would result in eight additional seats that lean at least 5 percentage points toward the legislature’s party, five fewer seats that lean at least 5 percentage points toward the opposition party and three fewer highly competitive seats.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the partisan upshot, it would result in two additional Democratic-leaning seats and one more Republican-leaning seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> More importantly, it would also embolden legislatures in other states — knowing their maps wouldn’t be subject to judicial review — to draw more extreme gerrymanders in the future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A ruling in favor of the independent state legislature theory could also jeopardize state redistricting commissions. A lot depends on the scope of the ruling, said <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/experts/ethan-herenstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethan Herenstein</a>, counsel with the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program, but embracing the idea that state legislatures have sole control over the redistricting process could imperil those commissions’ authority — even though the court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/arizona-state-legislature-v-arizona-independent-redistricting-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upheld their constitutionality in 2015</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the court eliminates redistricting commissions, gerrymandering would dramatically increase. During this past redistricting cycle, commissions enacted 10 congressional maps containing 125 congressional districts, and those maps were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/did-redistricting-commissions-live-up-to-their-promise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally much fairer than legislatures’ maps</a>: Commission-enacted maps of at least three congressional districts had an average <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficiency gap</a> of just 6 percentage points toward the party they favored, while legislature-enacted maps of at least three districts had an average efficiency gap of 16 percentage points.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But if those commission-enacted maps were suddenly rendered null and void, the court would actually give Democrats a major political boost. Out of those 125 districts, 84 are in states where Democrats would control the redistricting process, and 28-41 are in states where Republicans would (depending on whether governors still have veto power over new maps). Of course, these numbers may change after the 2022 elections, though probably not by much. Thanks in part to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-redistricting-affects-the-battle-for-state-legislatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the way their maps are drawn</a>, very few legislatures are <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to be competitive</a> this year.</p>



<h2><strong>The country’s whole system for federal elections could change</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the impact wouldn’t stop at redistricting. The Constitution’s elections clause also covers every aspect of how federal elections are run. That includes the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/voting-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">56 voting restrictions passed since the 2020 election</a> — laws that require ID in order to vote, discourage absentee voting, move up voter deadlines, cut early voting, purge voters from the rolls and ban giving food and water to voters waiting in line. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">State courts are already <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-rights-litigation-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing challenges</a> to several such laws, but those could all get kneecapped if the Supreme Court fully embraces the independent state legislature theory. For example, in 2021, a state court <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-25c1633fd815ae57ca6c703a45c9d636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> North Carolina’s voter-ID law, and the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/nh-supreme-court-to-issue-ruling-in-sb-3-voter-registration-law-appeal-friday/36908393#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> a law imposing burdensome proof-of-residency requirements on people without an ID who register to vote within 30 days of an election. These laws might very well go back into effect after a ruling in favor of North Carolina’s Legislature in Moore v. Harper.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, courts would not be able to unilaterally change federal election laws in an emergency, like the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pa-supreme-court-extends-mail-in-ballot-deadlines-to-3-days-after-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania Supreme Court did in 2020</a> when it extended the deadline for absentee ballots to be received amid <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/usps-mail-in-ballot-guidelines-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread delays in postal service</a>. “​​If the state legislature says, ‘Polls close at 7 p.m.,’ and on Election Day, there’s a hurricane and the [state] Supreme Court says, ‘Keep them open until 10,’ the legislature wins,” Vladeck said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A sweeping ruling could also remove election officials’ discretion over how to administer elections, creating chaos on the ground. Right now, for instance, secretaries of state and local election officials make lots of decisions, big and small, so that elections run smoothly. But the independent state legislature theory could hand those decisions to legislators who often don’t work full-time and who have much less knowledge about the thousands of minute details that govern elections. “Elections are way too complex for legislators to legislate every single nook and cranny,” Herenstein said. But an extreme ruling in this case could, he said, “stop or slow state legislatures from even voluntarily sharing their power with election administrators.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This would not only endanger programs that election officials have enacted of their own accord, like Colorado’s, Connecticut’s and Georgia’s implementation of <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic voter registration</a>. It would also tie their hands in emergencies. For example, in 2020, officials in at least 41 states made executive decisions to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loosen election regulations</a> and encourage people to vote by mail amid the COVID-19 pandemic — everything from <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/05/19/all-michigan-voters-get-absentee-ballot-applications-in-mail/5218266002/?utm_campaign=snd-autopilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailing voters absentee-ballot applications</a> to <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/07/merrill-extends-covid-19-emergency-absentee-voting-rule-to-general-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counting COVID-19 as a valid excuse to vote absentee</a> to <a href="https://dos.myflorida.com/communications/press-releases/2020/public-notice-secretary-of-state-laurel-m-lee-provides-update-about-voter-registration-in-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extending voter-registration deadlines</a> to <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/elections/absentee-drop-boxes-in-georgia-here-through-november-election/85-ac62bf26-b56e-4960-9ba5-67f8863e9976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting up ballot drop boxes</a> to <a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2020/03/24/carney-moves-primary-election-june-2/2911534001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postponing entire primaries</a>. This may no longer be possible come 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some Trump allies have also argued that the independent state legislature theory empowers legislatures to appoint an alternate set of state electors — which, in 2020, could have overturned the presidential election. However, <a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/leah-litman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leah Litman</a>, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said that it’s important to remember that even the independent state legislature theory doesn’t mean state legislatures would be <em>completely</em> unchecked, because the U.S. Constitution would still apply. But she added that part of what alarms her about the theory is that it’s so unclear what embracing it would actually do. “It’s just kind of a mess,” she said of the theory. “We really don’t know what it would look like.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also don’t know what the court will do. Three justices — Thomas, Gorsuch and Alito — seem likely to embrace the theory and rule in favor of the North Carolina Legislature since they already said that’s what they thought the court should do. Another Republican-appointed justice, Brett Kavanaugh, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a455_5if6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> earlier this year that the issue was “important” and that “both sides have advanced serious arguments on the merits,” which suggests that he’s at least open to the idea. It’s far from clear that there are five votes to sign onto the independent state legislature theory — but at least some of the conservative justices seem to be on board already.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">A year ago, Rep. Jim Banks, a Republican from Indiana, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20534328-banks-working-class-memo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a memo</a> to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy about how he thought the Republican Party should work to keep the coalition that had voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Republicans, he thought, could “permanently become the Party of the Working Class.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was a paradigm shift, he argued, and embracing it would be key to Republicans winning back the House and Senate in the midterm elections. “After five years,” he said, “it’s clear this reversal isn’t a temporary realignment contingent on Donald Trump’s presence in the White House — both parties are undergoing coalitional transformations.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Democrats, meanwhile, memos on how to hold on to or win back the working class are perennial favorites from <a href="https://democracycorps.com/focus-group-reports/getting-heard-by-our-discontented-working-class-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pollsters</a> and <a href="https://www.greenbergresearch.com/his-thinking/democrats-win-working-class-new-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategists</a>. This has been especially true during the midterm cycle as Democrats sound the alarm that their party is out of touch with their constituents. “The starting point for the strategy is seeing that both our base and our target persuasion audiences are working-class and struggling, and we see them and wear their shoes,” the longtime pollster Stanley Greenberg <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/polling-how-democrats-can-win-back-working-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a polling memo in November</a>. What’s left unsaid but is heavily implied in these appeals, though, is that Democrats are primarily concerned with losing the <em>white</em> working class.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These voters are the focus of key Senate races in Pennsylvania and Ohio, two states where the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016. President Biden narrowly won back Pennsylvania in 2020, but Ohio remained unattainable. Yet Democrats are following similar playbooks: In Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is <a href="https://johnfetterman.com/issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking about unions</a>, and in Ohio, Rep. Tim Ryan is promising to raise <a href="https://timforoh.com/issues/cutting-workers-in-on-the-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the minimum wage and expand child care</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/california-primary-races-watch-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85222569</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">These messages, though, are unlikely to work on their own because the dividing line in the American electorate is not economics; it’s race and culture. Democratic strategists often point to Barack Obama’s presidency and his response to the Great Recession as a turning point for the party’s appeals to working-class white people. After all, Obama <a href="https://www.270towin.com/2008_Election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won many of the Rust Belt states</a> partly on the strength of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/upshot/why-trump-won-working-class-whites.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white working-class vote</a>, but after his presidency, many of those voters <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/11/trump-won-a-lot-of-white-working-class-obama-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned to Trump and the Republican Party</a>. That’s because Obama’s presidency marked another big turning point in American society: a step toward greater racial equity. And on this issue, Democrats and Republicans could not be further apart. It’s why Democratic appeals to win back the working class are unlikely to work, too.</p>



<h2><strong>The parties’ pitches</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the <a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/building-a-stronger-fairer-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic Party’s 2020 platform</a>, “building a stronger, fairer economy” was the <a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second item listed</a>, after strategies to deal with COVID-19, and it sounded a populist note: that the American economy is tilted toward corporations and the wealthy, and that it’s harder than ever for Americans to move up the economic ladder. “Americans deserve an economy that works for everyone — not just for the wealthy and the well-connected,” their platform reads. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, Biden’s COVID-19 relief bill focused largely on the economy and passed soon after he took office. They’ve also concentrated on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/06/27/manchin-schumer-build-back-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other priorities</a> meant to help middle-class families financially, including an effort that would expand the child tax credit and help families pay for child care and extend subsidies for health insurance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, the agenda Banks laid out in his memo to McCarthy centers on nationalistic policies and cultural issues — not necessarily economic ones. For instance, Banks devotes an entire category to “Anti-Wokeness,” writing, “Nothing better encapsulates Democrats’ elitism and classism than their turn towards ‘wokeness.’” And the first item on his list is immigration. But even when the memo does turn to the economy, in its section on trade, Banks largely makes an anti-China argument. “President Trump’s push to take on the Chinese Communist Party resonated because voters felt, correctly, that the Communist Party harmed American jobs more than any other foreign government.” Likewise, Banks’s point during a section on “Main Street vs Wall Street” is to rail against the COVID-19 shutdown policies and not point to any economic differences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s clear from the two parties’ approaches is that Republicans mainly think of the working class as a cultural and racial identity, and not an economic one. Democrats, to be sure, are also leaning into a cultural appeal when they pitch themselves to working-class voters — primarily a populist appeal bent on uniting the working class against corporate greed — but it is still rooted more in economics than any national culture-war issue.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">One struggle for Democrats in this messaging war is that cultural and ethnic identities have traditionally mattered more to Americans than class identity. “America is the only country that never had a mass socialist movement or a really successful labor movement on the level of even Canada, much less Europe,” said David Brady, a <a href="https://bradydave.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside</a>. “So I think that America has a sort of skittishness or reluctance to embrace its social class solidarity.” Americans are somewhat divided on class politics: Most say unions have had a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/03/majorities-of-americans-say-unions-have-a-positive-effect-on-u-s-and-that-decline-in-union-membership-is-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive effect on American life</a>, but many are also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/07/in-their-own-words-behind-americans-views-of-socialism-and-capitalism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skeptical of socialism</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/working-class-anger-fuels-trump-popularity-in-wisconsin/3260796.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some</a> Democratic <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/democrats-speak-to-working-class-discontent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategists</a> and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/03/frank-rich-no-sympathy-for-the-hillbilly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pundits</a> have <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/the-perfect-storm-working-class-voters-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that Trump was successful because he recognized the anger that the working classes have felt since the Great Recession and because he then channeled it, even if he didn’t have the policies to match. The Democratic strategists, though, argue that they do have such policies. And indeed, legislation like the COVID-19 recovery bill <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-bidens-covid-19-relief-bill-help-democrats-avoid-a-midterm-defeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been popular</a>. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/03/09/broad-public-support-for-coronavirus-aid-package-just-a-third-say-it-spends-too-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seventy percent of adults</a> were in favor of it, including even 41 percent of Republicans. However, Biden’s popularity has dropped <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">below 40 percent</a> since then, and Republicans are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored to reclaim the House</a>. These policies on their own just aren’t enough to break through an increasingly divided country. </p>

Tim Ryan has tried to center his Senate campaign on workers in Ohio, but he faces an uphill battle against Republican nominee J.D. Vance. <p>Matthew Hatcher / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Who is the “working class”?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the problem for Democrats is that since Trump’s election, the definition of “working class” — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/23/readers-reply-what-do-the-terms-working-class-and-middle-class-actually-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already a squishy term</a> — has <a href="https://www.demos.org/research/understanding-working-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely come to be defined</a> as people who haven’t graduated from college, especially when it refers to white people. The issue with this definition is that it constitutes the vast majority of Americans: Only about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2021/02/22/new-from-us-census-bureau-number-of-americans-with-a-bachelors-degree-continues-to-grow/?sh=4afe946b7bbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a third of adults</a> in the country over the age of 25 hold a bachelor’s degree, including about 36 percent of white, non-Hispanic people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, while it’s generally true that not having a college degree leads to lower average earnings than having one, that broad assessment <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/collegepayoff2021/#resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not always true</a>. (The amount a college degree pays off <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/college-pays-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also varies by race</a> and gender.) It misses groups like small-business owners, who may not have gone to college but whose incomes vary widely. In fact, some blue-collar workers, like those employed in the natural gas industry, might have upper-middle-class income levels. In these cases, the economic threats they often see are from Democrats to their industries, not to their own finances, which is why messaging about the government’s role in helping struggling families can fall flat with them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In general, Trump and the Republican Party have solidified a base of support <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2018-12/Grinnell%20College%20National%20Poll_Nov18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in rural areas</a>, which are overwhelmingly white and have lower rates of college attainment than the country as a whole, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/employment-education/rural-education/#:~:text=Educational%20Attainment,-While%20the%20overall&amp;text=Over%20the%20same%20period%2C%20the,at%2035%20percent%20in%202019." target="_blank" rel="noopener">at just 21 percent</a>. But understanding class divisions in rural America is challenging. <a href="https://slate.com/business/2016/05/small-business-owners-have-a-thing-for-donald-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small-business owners</a> and county leaders, for instance, seem to have supported Trump in just as high numbers as their lower-earning neighbors. Moreover, because fewer people with a bachelor’s degree live in rural counties overall, non-college-educated workers are just more likely to make up the middle class there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you have enough money to buy a truck and have enough money to feed your family and have a four-person house, you’re certainly not struggling,” said Daniel Laurison, a sociologist at Swarthmore College. But Republicans and Trump, according to Laurison, have used confusion around class to their advantage. “Being a white person without a college degree makes you a ‘regular guy,’” said Laurison. “It doesn’t make you economically disadvantaged.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet there’s still a tendency, especially among college-educated, urban workers, to assume that those kinds of cultural differences indicate a different class position and that it’s rural voters’ class position — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/20/trump-made-a-connection-here-rural-supporters-iowa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not their cultural attitudes</a> — driving their votes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this takes it as a given that the long-term trends in economic outcomes, which have affected many Americans, are what Trump’s voters are responding to. This line of thinking, though, ignores other changes in American life and politics, such as an increase in global trade, a shift toward knowledge work instead of blue-collar labor, a relatively new emphasis on sending students to college and a more expansive view of rights and equalities for racial, ethnic and gender minorities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These rifts in the kind of work that people do, the lives they live, who their neighbors are and what they think is important are what the educational divide might be picking up as much as income. “We certainly see a lot of mistrust of the elites, of people in positions of power, business leaders and elected leaders,” said Jeffrey Jones, senior editor of Gallup. “Education is a split [that] … we hadn’t seen before.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When Trump voters are interviewed about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/why-did-people-vote-for-donald-trump-us-voters-explain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why they supported him</a>, they highlight gun rights, abortion, America’s standing in the world and anti-Obama and anti-Clinton sentiment. It’s, in part, why Republicans continue to attack the cultural elite, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/us/trump-ivy-league-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elite colleges</a> to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37722897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington elite,</a> in their messages. They know this resonates with their base as there’s ample evidence that Trump voters’ anxiety is more about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/existential-anxiety-not-poverty-motivates-trump-support/558674/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial and gender equality and America’s standing in the world</a> than it is about economic equality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In reality, voters who rank the economy as their top concern <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voters-who-think-the-economy-is-the-countrys-biggest-problem-are-pretty-trumpy-that-might-not-help-him-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to be richer, whiter and more Republican-leaning already</a>, and their economic concerns very likely come from a different viewpoint than a class-based grievance sparked by inequality.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In his bid for a Senate seat in Ohio, Rep. Tim Ryan is making his appeal to voters based, in part, on a <a href="https://timforoh.com/issues/cutting-workers-in-on-the-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise</a> to raise the minimum wage and expand child care access. But his argument also has an <a href="https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1508795783210016772?s=20&amp;t=gYnwnM2Aqbhl34toezxDxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-China component</a>, which sparked criticism <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/04/04/facing-criticism-tim-ryan-defends-anti-china-ad-in-ohio-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from other Democrats for using the “hate” and “fear”</a> of the Republican playbook. Additionally, in his first ad against J.D. Vance, his Republican opponent, <a href="https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1521665423430893568?s=20&amp;t=DxLOG9C8uTf2fDyz_Qt5AQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan struck a populist chord, criticizing Vance</a> for having left Ohio for San Francisco “to make millions and invest in companies that profit from globalization and free trade.” Ryan says all this while sitting at a diner. “[Vance] became a celebrity, CNN analyst and a big hit at Washington cocktail parties,” says Ryan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s hard to see how these cultural attacks, normally made by Republicans against Democrats, will work. For starters, the facts of Vance’s post-Ohio life might not matter as much as the basics of his biography — he served in the military and first became famous for writing a book about his Appalachian grandparents. Moreover, as a candidate, he hasn’t shied away from <a href="https://youtu.be/K3qYJoSV0lI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openly nationalistic, anti-Latino</a> appeals. According to Laurison, the elite thing doesn’t stick either, “because [Vance is] not part of the ‘cultural elite’ in the same way.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In Pennsylvania, Fetterman is a slightly different case. He’s served as mayor of a Rust Belt town and as a lieutenant governor with just-a-dude authenticity. But the voters who put Biden over the top in 2020 were largely the voters for whom the Democratic message is already appealing or suburban voters who found Trump off-putting. It’s true that Fetterman won the primary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/17/us/elections/results-pennsylvania-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty much everywhere</a> — and handily — but he lacked support from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/us/politics/conor-lamb-pennsylvania-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic establishment</a>, and it’s unclear whether he can win over more moderate, suburban voters in the general election. Polls show time and again that lower-middle-class voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote</a> for Democrats, while <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white voters of all income levels vote for Republicans</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s also some evidence that Democratic voters want their party to also concentrate on social issues: A <a href="https://democracycorps.com/focus-group-reports/getting-heard-by-our-discontented-working-class-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy Corps focus group</a> from May found that Democratic voters positively associated Democrats with “equality; civil liberties and rights; empathy; civil rights; police reform; social issues; and focus on the environment.” The issue on economics and on social issues, the memo said, was that “Democrats always ‘disappoint.’ They promise big change and nothing happens.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is at odds with the advice of strategists like David Shor. “[T]he way we get around [ideological polarization] is by talking a lot about progressive goals that are not ideologically polarizing, goals that we share with self-described conservatives and moderates,” Shor, a Democratic data scientist, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/david-shor-2020-democrats-autopsy-hispanic-vote-midterms-trump-gop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told New York Magazine last March</a>. “Even among nonwhite voters, those tend to be economic issues.” But this assumes that voters will forget about the party alignments that are deeply entrenched.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When Democrats lament a bygone era in which they won the working-class vote, they are primarily talking about the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt— a time when the economy was radically shifted toward worker and labor power. But that was also a time when policies meant to favor the working class were specifically designed to help white men. The relative position of many people in the economy — and society at large — has shifted, and if that’s what Republican voters are responding to, messages of economic justices and <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/abetterdeal/higher-wages-and-better-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leveling the playing field</a> for all workers won’t change that. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In last week’s Jan. 6 congressional hearing, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson outlined the days leading up to the attack on the U.S. Capitol and testified that then-President Donald Trump and some people in his administration were aware of the threat of violence. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses how this hearing could affect Americans’ views of Trump and the Republican nominees running in the midterm who support Trump’s “Big Lie.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The crew also analyzes a <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1696&amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new poll</a> from the University of New Hampshire that garnered quite a bit of media attention for complicating the 2024 Republican presidential primaries. And Kaleigh Rogers and Nate Silver compete in an Independence Day-inspired statistics game where they guess how many Americans know the country’s national anthem and how many prefer burgers over hot dogs.</p>

		</div>





<p data-paragraph="main">Conservatives got what they wanted from this year’s Supreme Court term — and then some. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a flurry of decisions released at the end of June, the court’s Republican-appointed justices released opinions that <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned the constitutional right to abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded gun rights</a>, allowed individual public school employees to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-418_i425.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pray on the job</a>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1088_dbfi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it harder</a> for states to exclude religious schools from public funding programs, and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s power</a> to regulate carbon emissions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was a stunning display of the conservative justices’ power, less than two years after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-unusually-big-jump-to-the-right-might-look-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> gave former President Donald Trump <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-amy-coney-barrett-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the chance to appoint a third justice</a>, leaving the court’s Republican appointees with a six-justice supermajority.  This was the first full term with all three of Trump’s appointees on the court, and at the beginning of the term, we weren’t sure whether they would move incrementally to the right — a tack that <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2020/07/stuart-gerson-understanding-john-roberts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chief Justice John Roberts prefers</a> — or take a more aggressive approach. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The conservatives answered by delivering the most far-reaching slew of rulings in modern memory. It’s now abundantly clear that Trump’s appointees are in control of this court, and they’re not searching for consensus. In fact, the divide between the court’s Republican and Democratic appointees is deeper than it’s been in the modern era.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-court-dealt-big-blow-separation-church-state-85886797</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Usually, around half of the court’s rulings are unanimous and decisions that pit the conservative and liberal blocs against each other are much rarer. Not this year. According to SCOTUSBlog data analyzed by FiveThirtyEight, 21 percent of rulings were polarized by party of the appointing president, with all Republican appointees voting one way and all Democratic appointees voting the other way, and only 29 percent were unanimous.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the analysis in the chart below, we used categorizations from the Supreme Court Database in combination with SCOTUSBlog to determine when justices agreed and dissented, including cases where justices agreed in part and dissented in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> </p>

There have always been ideological disagreements among the justices, and those have often pitted liberals against conservatives, but those divides weren’t consistently linked to the justice’s appointing party. For instance, former justices like Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O’Connor were appointed by a Republican president, but broke with their fellow Republican-appointed justices on key issues like separation of church and state, abortion and same-sex marriage. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, though, there really isn’t a “swing” justice. According to preliminary Martin-Quinn scores, a commonly used metric of judicial ideology, Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas anchor the right side of the conservative bloc, while the other conservative-appointed justices are basically indistinguishable from each other. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="970" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1104" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1-mob.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1-mob.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1-mob.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1-mob.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This means that the justices in the center — Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch — are the ones who need to be convinced to join the majority in politically important cases. And although it’s hard to tell from the Martin-Quinn scores, they didn’t agree on everything. The most high-profile division was in Dobbs v. Jackson, the case that overruled abortion rights, where Roberts voted to uphold Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban but not to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gorsuch, meanwhile, had some even sharper disagreements with his fellow Republican appointees. Perhaps most notably, he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-crime-native-americans-oklahoma-congress-98184e0e1d0085690bb340c99b48a90e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissented with the liberals</a> in a case where the other conservatives voted to give states more power over Native American reservations, contradicting the court’s position from just two years earlier. But that case wasn’t an outlier. According to SCOTUSBlog’s data, Gorsuch was in the majority in divided cases 65 percent of the time — only slightly more than liberal Justice Elena Kagan (57 percent). </p>

Alito wrote 21 percent of the opinions in ideologically polarized cases, and Thomas wrote 29 percent — more than any other justices except Roberts (29 percent). That means that together, the two far-right justices wrote half of the polarized opinions, including the decision overruling abortion rights and the decision expanding gun rights. And both Alito and Thomas were in the majority more than they’ve been in the recent past, particularly in divided cases. Alito, for instance, was in the majority in 78 percent of divided cases — up from <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SCOTUSblog-Final-STAT-PACK-OT2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58 percent of divided cases</a> two years ago. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The court, meanwhile, isn’t just polarized along partisan lines — its decisions also increasingly align with the views of the average Republican voter. In that sense, the Supreme Court’s tack to the right actually started a year ago — at least, according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2120284119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new research</a> from political scientists Stephen Jessee, Neil Malhotra and Maya Sen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In surveys conducted in 2010, 2020 and 2021, the researchers asked Americans what <em>their</em> opinion was about the central issues in the highest-profile cases each term, and then compared their findings to the Supreme Court’s actual rulings. They found that the court’s rulings in 2010 — when Kennedy was the median — fell roughly between liberal respondents and conservative respondents, in the country’s ideological mainstream. Ten years later, in 2020, Roberts had replaced Kennedy as the median, but the court’s decisions were still in that same middle-of-the-road position. But the following year, after Barrett joined the court, its rulings lurched to the right. Rather than falling between Republicans’ and Democrats’ views, its rulings were overall very close to the position of the average Republican respondent.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-courts-gun-ruling-remakes-gun-control-americans-85660014</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The researchers haven’t finished analyzing this year’s data yet. But comparing the justices’ rulings to public opinion is helpful because although it’s clear the court is getting more conservative, it’s harder to quantitatively pin down exactly how conservative it’s become. For example, in 2005, his first year on the court, Roberts was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roberts-is-the-new-swing-justice-that-doesnt-mean-hes-becoming-more-liberal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tied with Alito as the third-most conservative justice</a>. Now, relative to his peers, he’s the sixth-most conservative justice. Does that mean Roberts moved to the left? Or does it mean the court moved to the right? The Martin-Quinn scores can’t tell us. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s important to bear that limitation in mind because this term, the conservative justices didn’t just deliver lots of conservative rulings — they decided lots of cases that dramatically shifted the law to the right. It’s hard to track quantitatively, but cases with a conservative outcome in previous terms likely had more modest effects and didn’t diverge so much from mainstream public opinion, because there wasn’t a clear majority of justices who wanted to do big, sweeping things like overturn Roe v. Wade. So comparing the share of conservative decisions in each term may actually understate the court’s rightward shift quite a bit because many of the cases the court is now hearing are potentially much broader in scope.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, the question is just how far the conservative majority wants to go. In <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year’s end-of-term round-up</a>, we pointed out that in cases in which the conservative justices disagreed, the more centrist group — Roberts, Kavanaugh and Barrett — were driving the direction of decisions. That’s still true, but if the past term is any guide, the two most conservative justices — Alito and Thomas — will have a much more powerful role in the conservative bloc going forward. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And over time, it seems likely that the polarization on the court will only deepen as the justices — like the rest of the country — retreat into their ideological camps. Roberts, after all, expressed dissatisfaction with the scope of his fellow Republican appointees’ ruling on abortion — but he wasn’t unhappy enough to join the other side. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A native of Austin, Texas, Hunter Ellinger grew up in <a href="https://austin.culturemap.com/news/city-life/09-12-16-best-american-cities-liberals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a progressive hotspot</a>. In a recent phone conversation, he recalled his upbringing in the 1950s, when a group of liberal activists — often organized by his mother and father — would repeatedly protest <a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/civil-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist laws</a> passed by the state’s legislature. Ellinger was a teenager at the time and, therefore, unable to vote, but he still remembers feeling “like an anomaly within Texas.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, at 79 years old, those feelings have only intensified. Ellinger still lives in Austin, <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2017/02/17/how-liberal-is-austin/10402757007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Texas’s most liberal cities</a>, and boasts that, in a sense, he’s carried on his mother’s legacy: He was involved in the civil rights movement, the Peace Corps, the 1970s alternative press and participated in a slew of anti-war protests over the last several decades.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’ve voted in every election I’ve ever been able to vote in, which started in 1964, and I’ve always voted Democratic,” Ellinger said, noting that the current party is further to the right than he is. “I would describe myself as half-commie, half-anarchist,” he said. “I want the government and society as a whole to work for everybody, but I also want everybody to be strong enough and free enough to put things together in their own way.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given his political leanings, Ellinger described himself as a “Silent Generation progressive.” But that’s not the norm for voters his age. In fact, Americans in Ellinger’s age group — those over the age of 65 — were the most likely of any age group to say that they approved of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/01/22/by-a-narrow-margin-americans-say-senate-trial-should-result-in-trumps-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump’s job performance</a>, and registered voters from his generation were the most likely to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/01/1-generations-party-identification-midterm-voting-preferences-views-of-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favor Republican candidates</a>, according to the Pew Research Center. And among registered voters, Silent Generation men were <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely than women of the same age</a> to favor Republicans as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is in line with the conventional wisdom that there’s a consistent age gap in our politics today, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/sep/23/older-americans-vote-republican-fact-check-election-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older voters vote red</a> and younger voters veer blue. And there are myriad reasons why this is the case. For one, older Americans are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/09/03/the-whys-and-hows-of-generations-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to be white and religious</a> — <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/168083/seniors-realigned-republican-party.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two demographic groups</a> that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/174134/religion-remains-strong-marker-political-identity.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also tend to vote Republican</a>. They’re also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to favor less government intervention</a> and are more prone to believing that increased diversity <em>isn’t </em>a good thing for the country — which is in line with <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/24/17607608/racial-diversity-republicans-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republicans’ way of thinking</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But these sentiments weren’t shared by the four voters older than 50, including Ellinger, whom I spoke with for this piece. In fact, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many were closer to younger generations</a> — like Gen Z or millennials — when it came to their political beliefs; climate change, racial justice, abortion access and higher wages were among some of the top policy priorities they listed, even if they were skeptical that Congress would address these things in their lifetime. Moreover, even though almost everyone I talked with said they wished the Democratic Party would go further left and support policies championed by, say, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members of “The Squad,”</a> a progressive group of Democratic lawmakers made up mainly of women of color, they didn’t begrudge President Biden for not pushing forward a more progressive political agenda, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/progressives-urge-biden-deliver-campaign-promises-dems-struggle-frustrated-base-1653727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as he once promised</a>. Rather, several applauded him for the work he’s done in office post-Trump, but wished the Democratic Party itself would invest more in building a younger, more liberal bench of successors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I do feel like the lack of constant generation change has left Democrats a little stuck,” said Pamela M., a 52-year-old from rural Maryland who preferred to use only her first name and last initial for privacy. “They don’t know how to advertise and haven’t had a great ground-game strategy in a way that a wide swath of people respond to.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, that hasn’t deterred Pamela M. — a self-described “Warren Democrat” — from supporting and voting for Democratic candidates over the years. But part of the reason for her loyalty might have less to do with her agreeing with establishment Democrats’ policy priorities and more to do with the fact that, on average, voters over 45 years old (and especially those 65 and older) are the age group most likely to turn out to vote. Since 1996 or so, there’s been a correlation <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1096299/voter-turnout-presidential-elections-by-age-historical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between voter participation and age</a>, and in 2020, almost 72 percent of those ages 65 and over cast a ballot — about 10 percentage points more than the national average. </p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certain polls</a> and <a href="https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/politics/info-2022/shes-the-difference-likely-voters-50-plus-survey-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports by interest groups</a> representing older voters suggest that those over the age of 50 may be slightly competitive as a voting bloc; but on the whole, older voters do <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/sep/23/older-americans-vote-republican-fact-check-election-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lean Republican</a>. In 2016 and 2020, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew’s validated-voter survey</a>, Trump won Silent Generation voters — those born between 1928 and 1945 — by 19- and 16-percentage-point margins, respectively. Meanwhile, baby boomers — those born between 1946 and 1964 — were more split between Democrats and Republicans, although Trump still narrowly bested Biden and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton among voters in this generation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are always outliers, though. In fact, there’s a small percentage of older Americans who said that they not only lean Democratic — but identify more with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. According to the 2020 <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/E9N6PH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooperative Election Study</a>, about 6 percent of Americans<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses were weighted to match the general adult population of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> born in 1955 or before identified as “very liberal,” 12 percent as “liberal” and another 7 percent as “somewhat liberal.” This compares to roughly 50 percent of Americans born in 1955 or before who said they were “somewhat” or more conservative. But many of the left-of-center voters I spoke with didn’t just identify as liberal, they also said that it was <em>detrimental </em>for other people their age to consistently cast ballots for the GOP.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Typically, the older and wealthier you become, the more likely you are to vote Republican,” said Kathleen Helbing, a 70-year-old living in Indiana and a self-described socialist. “But I don’t know why people vote against their own economic interests. To any old person who votes Republican, especially after [Florida Sen.] Rick Scott put out <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/04/07/democratic-ad-exaggerates-scope-of-rick-scotts-proposal-on-social-security-medicare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this 11-point agenda</a> that discussed potentially sunsetting federal legislation, like Social Security, I think, ‘Are you people out of your mind?’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As is <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the case for Americans as a whole</a>, the No. 1 issue for voters over <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/02/16/publics-top-priority-for-2022-strengthening-the-nations-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65 is the economy</a>, and the GOP’s messaging there might resonate more with older voters concerned with things like inflation, rising prices of everyday items and unemployment if they’re not retired. “I suspect most of it has to do with accumulating more money as they get older, and wanting to protect their monetary interests. They believe the Republican policies will help protect their interests,” said Liz McGeachy, a 64-year-old from Tennessee. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another point might also contribute to why older Americans often lean Republican: They’re <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/23/millennials-are-just-as-racist-as-their-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely</a> to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/08/12/deep-divisions-in-americans-views-of-nations-racial-history-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be racist</a>. In a September 2021 Public Religion Research Institute survey, Americans ages 65 and older were 25 points more likely to say that America’s “culture and way of life” had mostly changed for the worse since the 1950s than they were to say it’d mostly changed for the better — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-keep-losing-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a common refrain</a> among the GOP voters these days. And according to data that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a> published in January 2019, older generations were less likely than younger generations to say that they thought more racial and ethnic diversity was a good thing for society. In September 2021, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/27/support-for-black-lives-matter-declined-after-george-floyd-protests-but-has-remained-unchanged-since/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew also found</a> that adults ages 50-64 (49 percent) and those ages 65 and older (46 percent) were the age groups least likely to support the Black Lives Matter movement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, as the Democratic Party <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/racial-ethnic-diversity-increases-yet-again-with-the-117th-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becomes increasingly multiracial</a>, older white voters — especially those <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with racially conservative views</a> — might be turned off from supporting Democrats. “I don’t know whether it’s racism and the fear that Latino and African American people are going to have more power someday?” Helbing said. “I guess a lot of people see life as a zero-sum game that if you get, I lose.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The older progressive voters I talked with, of course, don’t buy into that messaging and, as a result, have been loyal Democratic voters for most — if not all — of their lives. That said, just because the people I spoke with identify as progressives doesn’t mean they were necessarily over the moon with the current Democrats holding federal office. Many gave Biden plaudits for handling what one voter called a “disaster” inherited by the Trump administration, but they also weren’t optimistic that more progressive policies would happen anytime soon.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Sometimes there’s this expectation that everything is going to change now, but I think change is a moderate experience and not necessarily immediate,” said Pamela M., the 52-year-old from Maryland. “I have progressive ideas on what should happen but a realistic timeline on when it’ll happen. A lot of young progressives think you can vote and win an election and everything changes, but that’s not how things typically work.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of this pragmatism could be because, as Ellinger told me, voters his age have been following politics for so long that they know it takes a long time for real change to occur. That’s especially true today, given the fact that a moderate Democrat holds the presidency and Democrats hold only slim majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think Biden and such represent a substantial majority of the Democratic Party. It would be great to the extent that could be changed, to add more people to the left of them in positions of power, but I don’t think, at this moment, that’ll happen,” Ellinger said. “Democracy doesn’t always give you perfect results, but the nature of it is working with people who are representative of most of your political beliefs.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there might be another reason why progressive ideas aren’t likely to pass anytime soon: a perception among voters that Democrats are already <em>too </em>liberal. According to data that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/26/state-of-the-parties-ideology-extremes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> published in July 2021, the share of registered voters between 2017 and 2021 who said the Democratic Party was “too liberal” rose 5 percentage points. In 2021, a plurality of all voters (45 percent) and independent voters (46 percent) were more likely to say this was the case, compared with 37 percent of voters and 34 percent of independents who said the GOP has gone too far right.</p>

And while some people either endorsed this idea or admitted that the party now is further right than they are, most said that the best way for the Democratic Party to move forward would be for them to develop a message that can unite everyone in their base and cease infighting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I lean toward wanting the moderate Democrats to embrace the policies of the more progressive members of the party, but I also believe the progressive wing needs to be willing to compromise too,” McGeachy said. “They all need to create a unified message, stand behind it and share it with the whole country — not just preach to the choir.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, many voters think that politicians around the age of, say, Biden, who will turn 80 in November, shouldn’t be the ones running the show — let alone holding the presidency. Many advocated for ushering in younger, nonwhite leaders into the Democratic Party who could help move it further left. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“I think when you hit 70 years old, you say, ‘It’s time to make room for another generation. I will tend my garden or write poetry or stare out a window, but I will make room so that other people can have a crack at it,’” said Helbing, the 70-year-old in Indiana. “Because they couldn’t screw things up any more than we have.” Biden, she said, is going to be in his 80s in mere months. “I’m going to be 71 soon, and I don’t think I’m as sharp as I was 20 years ago.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Asking older politicians to step down might be tough, though. Beyond the fact that senators and representatives aren’t term-limited, many will sit in office as long as voters keep electing them, instead of choosing to retire. Because of these factors, young people are badly underrepresented in Congress: The <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/117th-congress-book-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average age of a U.S. senator is currently 64</a> — roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241494/median-age-of-the-us-population/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 years older</a> than the median U.S. resident. In the House, the average age is 58. And going into the 2020 election, many of the leading presidential contenders — Trump, Biden and Sanders — were all septuagenarians. Biden himself was first elected to the Senate in 1972, meaning that  he has been in Washington for nearly half a century — longer than most have been alive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s not to say that it’s impossible for a younger, more progressive guard to come into Congress and make the sort of difference that the voters I spoke with want. But it’ll be an uphill battle, especially as party leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continue to back <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/05/in-case-youre-wondering-nancy-pelosi-is-still-supporting-the-only-antiabortion-house-democrat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more moderate Democrats</a> over <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/us-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-backs-congresswoman-shontel-brown-in-11th-congressional-district-primary/95-b6ee3537-3ba7-4b57-9cd7-e5d29f640aba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their progressive challengers</a> this primary season. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plus, as we’ve previously reported, progressive Democrats often need <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger, multiracial coalitions</a> to win elections. But several of the people I spoke with said it’d be harmful to the party not to start building out a younger bench and helping these Democrats get elected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think Democrats fail to plan for generational change, and so we have a lot of newer, young people coming in, but there hasn’t been a plan for a changing of the guard and changing ideas along with that,” Pamela M. said. “Democrats need to be focusing on local and state elections to see who they can … train as the next generation. And they should’ve been doing this all along.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Last Friday, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade</a>, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion after almost 50 years. The decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization has sent states scrambling to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/interactive-map-shows-abortion-bans-effect-doctors-face/story?id=85881916" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrict abortion</a> or <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/us-states-banned-limited-protected-abortion-85641444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand access</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve found seven polls conducted since Friday that show whether U.S. adults approve or disapprove of the Dobbs decision, and as you can see in the table below, the takeaway is clear: More Americans disapprove of the ruling than approve of it.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Hints of this disapproval loomed large before Friday, too. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/06/24/american-opinion-supreme-court-abortion-roe-wade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a poll conducted by YouGov/The Economist</a> from June 18-21, 50 percent of Americans did not want the court to overturn Roe. And when YouGov ran a survey after the release of the Dobbs decision on June 24, it found that the same percentage of Americans disapproved of the court overruling Roe. (Support for overruling Roe didn’t waver much, either: Thirty-two percent were in favor of overturning Roe in the earlier survey, compared with 37 percent in the later survey.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just that Americans largely disapprove of the Dobbs decision. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/njf3k7gj5o/abortion_roe_reaction_toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A third YouGov poll</a>, this one fielded June 24-25, gave respondents 11 different choices to describe their reaction to the decision, and Americans reported feeling disgusted (34 percent) at a higher rate than any other emotion. This was closely followed by feeling sad (33 percent), angry (32 percent) and outraged (31 percent). A far smaller share of Americans reported positive emotions about the decision, such as feeling satisfied (19 percent), grateful (18 percent), happy (17 percent) and thrilled (12 percent). Notably, only 20 percent of Americans said they felt surprised by the decision, perhaps due to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the notorious leaked draft opinion</a> from early May as well as the court’s recent track record, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-conservative-supermajority-is-just-beginning-to-flex-its-muscles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which has been very conservative</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-courts-approval-rating-dropping-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85385158</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even though many Americans don’t approve of the court overturning Roe, their thoughts about the legality of abortion haven’t changed much since early September, when <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court allowed Texas’s six-week abortion ban</a> to go into effect. As you can see in the chart below, the breakdown of Americans who believe abortion should be always legal, mostly legal, mostly illegal and always illegal has been relatively stable since then.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="868" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAd.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAd.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAd.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAd.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="954" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAm.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAm.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAm.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAm.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, a greater share of Americans consistently think abortion should be mostly or always legal (an average of 58 percent across all surveys) than think it should be mostly or always illegal (an average of 39 percent). But it is telling that there hasn’t been more of a change in how Americans are thinking about abortion.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is that many Americans belong to a gray zone of public opinion when it comes to abortion. Between the “mostly legal” and “mostly illegal” groups, a little over half of Americans think there is no absolute answer as to whether abortion should be legal. Lack of a strong opinion may also correlate with lack of knowledge. As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight reported last December</a>, Gallup found in May 2018 that 60 percent of Americans believed abortion should be generally legal throughout the first trimester, but only 28 percent said the same for the second trimester. And yet this stands in contrast with Americans’ general support for Roe, which protected abortion until nearly the end of the second trimester.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While public opinion on abortion has remained fairly steady, public opinion on the Supreme Court has not. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394103/confidence-supreme-court-sinks-historic-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Gallup data</a>, Americans’ confidence in the court has been trending mostly downward since peaking in 1988, but it nosedived in the past year. Last June, Americans’ confidence in the court sat at 36 percent; however, in June 2022 — ahead of the Dobbs decision but after its draft opinion was leaked — it plummeted to 25 percent. This is the lowest confidence level since Gallup began the surveys almost 50 years ago, and it was driven primarily by a dramatic drop in confidence among Democrats and independents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t the first time that the Supreme Court has suffered a favorability problem. One prominent example is the court’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-contested-2020-election-would-be-way-worse-than-bush-v-gore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decision in Bush v. Gore</a>, where the Supreme Court overturned an order by the Florida state Supreme Court to recount a subset of ballots. But there’s a clear difference between now and the early 2000s: While many people didn’t like that decision, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/4732/Supreme-Court.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup reports</a> that 59 percent of Americans approved of the court in January 2001.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That might not be the case this time, though, given today’s incredibly polarized political climate. Additionally, there is evidence of a broader lack of faith in the court, which is at least partly driven by distrust in what is ultimately guiding the court’s decisions. Strikingly, according to an <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-the-overturning-of-roe-v-wade-june-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College</a> poll conducted June 24-25, 57 percent of Americans said that overturning Roe was “politically motivated and not motivated by the law.” </p>

<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>The Supreme Court’s ruling on abortion isn’t the only issue where it’s out of step with public opinion. Most Americans also disagreed with its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-gun-ruling-means-for-gun-control/">ruling</a> that New York’s gun-control law was unconstitutional, according to a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_063022/">recent survey from Monmouth University</a>. Fifty-six percent said that states should be allowed to limit the ability of people to carry concealed handguns through permits and other protocols.</li><li>Sixty percent of Americans overall had “very positive” views on their national flag, though that number changes dramatically when broken out by race, age and party, per a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/06/29/how-americans-view-flags-and-symbols-poll">YouGov poll published this week</a>. White Americans were nearly twice as likely as Black Americans to view the flag that favorably (70 percent and 37 percent, respectively). It’s a similar story between adults under the age of 30 (41 percent held a “very positive” view) versus adults over 65 (78 percent), as well as between Democrats (49 percent) and Republicans (83 percent).</li><li>As the Jan. 6 hearings continue, 51 percent of likely voters agreed that Trump-supporting Republicans’ challenges to the results of the 2020 election, including during the Capitol insurrection, were “[a]n attempt to claim and hold power and overturn the will of the people,” according to a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/6/28/a-majority-of-voters-believe-the-jan-6-attack-was-an-attempt-to-hold-power-and-overturn-the-will-of-the-people">poll from Data for Progress</a> conducted June 15-21. Among Democrats, a whopping 87 percent agreed with that view. Only 19 percent of Republicans thought so, however. By contrast, 66 percent of Republicans agreed with the idea that Trump-supporting Republicans’ challenges were “[b]ased on legitimate evidence of fraud, illegal voting, and false results.” </li><li>On the whole, Americans are cutting back on travel, per <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/06/30/summer-trips-will-be-one-and-done-2022/">recent polling from Morning Consult</a>. While the share of Americans planning to travel this summer is up compared with last summer, many said they plan to stick to fewer trips overall. The most noticeable drop comes from the study’s highest income bracket, or those in households that make over $100,000 annually: Only 31 percent planned to go on multiple trips this summer, compared with 44 percent who planned to in 2021. Despite the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-gas-holiday-might-be-popular-but-its-unlikely-to-do-much-to-lower-inflation/">hike in gas prices</a>, there’s been almost no change in those opting to drive (61 percent of travelers this summer and 59 percent last summer). </li></ul><h2>Biden approval</h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans are substantial favorites to take over the U.S. House of Representatives following this November’s midterm elections, but the U.S. Senate is much more competitive, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a>, which launched today. Democrats are also favored to hang on to the governorships in a trio of swing states in the Rust Belt — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — although they are significant underdogs to win high-profile gubernatorial races in Georgia and Texas against Republican incumbents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The split diagnosis reflects the difference between macro- and micro-level conditions. The national environment is quite poor for Democrats. Of course, this is typical for the president’s party, which has lost seats in the House in <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/seats-congress-gainedlost-the-presidents-party-mid-term-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but two of the past 21 midterm elections</a>. But Democrats are also saddled with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular President Biden</a> and a series of challenges for the country, including inflation levels that haven’t been seen in decades, the lingering effects of the still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democratic-values-are-still-under-attack-even-without-trump-in-the-white-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraying trust in civic institutions</a> — caused, in part, by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/28/us/jan-6-hearing-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats, as a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-in-blue-cities-are-increasingly-outliers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predominantly urban party</a>, also face a longstanding problem in the Senate, where every state has equal representation regardless of its population, resulting in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantial built-in bias toward white, rural states</a>. And although Democrats are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very slightly better off following the redistricting process in the House</a> than they were under the 2020 maps, there are still more Republican-leaning seats than Democratic-leaning ones.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">True, the political environment is dynamic. The Supreme Court’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decision last week to overturn Roe v. Wade</a> is too recent to be fully reflected in polls, but there are reasons to think it will help Democrats. Roe, which granted the constitutional right to abortion,<em> </em><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-despite-public-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was a popular precedent</a>, and Democratic voters are <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3537982-democrats-more-likely-to-vote-in-midterms-after-abortion-ruling-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely than Republican ones</a> to say the decision will encourage them to vote at the midterms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, in striking down Roe and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s-gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other popular laws</a> like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-gun-ruling-means-for-gun-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictions against the concealed carry of firearms</a>, the Supreme Court has in some ways undermined one of the traditional reasons that the president’s party tends to lose seats at the midterms. Typically, voters like some degree of balance: They do not want one party to have unfettered control of all levers of government. But the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, is a reminder of how much power Republicans have even if they don’t control the White House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 can also serve as a reminder to voters about what might happen if the Electoral College certification process takes place in 2024 amid Republican control of both chambers of Congress.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, note that because Congress is seated &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the electoral vote is counted, it’s the 2024 congressional elections that will determine who sits in Congress at that time — not these ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> Democrats have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-moving-on-from-jan-6-even-if-congress-hasnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had trouble getting the public to treat threats to democracy as a high priority</a>, but polls do show that the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/23/what-are-americans-thinking-about-the-january-6-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public is sympathetic to the Democrats’ case</a>, especially after the recent congressional hearings on the events of Jan. 6.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, this is not a typical, low-stakes midterm election. On the contrary, there are strong forces tugging at each side of the rope, some of which are potentially of existential importance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Democrats’ majorities in both chambers of Congress are narrow, the historical precedent toward the president’s party losing seats is strong, and polls so far — such as the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they would support in an election — suggest that voters slightly prefer Republican control of Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Or at least that’s the story in the House, where there are dozens of competitive races and candidates are relatively anonymous. There, big-picture factors tend to prevail. An unusually weak Republican candidate in one district might be counteracted by a strong one in another, for example.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the Senate and gubernatorial races, by contrast, individual factors can matter more. And the GOP has nominated — or is poised to nominate — candidates who might significantly underperform a “generic” Republican based on some combination of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/19/pennsylvania-republicans-dr-oz-senate-bid-523023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inexperience</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/us/politics/herschel-walker-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal scandals</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-gop-senate-candidate-masters-privatizing-social-security-2022-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having articulated unpopular conservative positions</a>. This is not a new problem for Republicans: underqualified or fringy candidates have <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/akin-legitimate-rape-victims-dont-get-pregnant-079864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost them seats in the Senate in other recent cycles</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s briefly run through the model’s forecast for House, Senate and gubernatorial races. Then I’ll describe some changes to the model since 2020 — which are modest this year but reflect how congressional races are changing in an increasingly polarized political environment.</p>



<h2><strong>The House</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an 87 percent chance of taking over the House</a>, according to the Deluxe version of our model. That’s far from certain, but Democrats are fighting the odds: Their 13 percent chances are equivalent to tossing a coin and having it come up tails three times in a row.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="848" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-711-2.png" alt="Ball-swarm (or bee-swarm) chart showing which party wins control of the House in 100 sample outcomes from our Deluxe model’s 40,000 simulations, where Democrats have a 13 percent chance of winning the chamber and Republicans have a 87 percent chance." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-711-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-711-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-711-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1064" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-335-2.png" alt="Ball-swarm (or bee-swarm) chart showing which party wins control of the House in 100 sample outcomes from our Deluxe model’s 40,000 simulations, where Democrats have a 13 percent chance of winning the chamber and Republicans have a 87 percent chance." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-335-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-335-2.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-335-2.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That’s not to say House control will be a matter of luck, exactly. A change in the political environment could have ripple effects. For instance, sometimes one party wins nearly all the toss-up races, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans did in 2020</a>. However, even if Democrats were to win all 13 races that our model currently designates as “toss-ups” (meaning that no party has more than a 60 percent chance of winning), plus hold on to all the seats in which they’re favored, they would still wind up with only 208 seats, 10 short of the number they need for a majority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, Democrats will also have to win some seats where Republican candidates are currently favored, and that requires the national political environment in November to be more favorable for Democrats than our model is currently expecting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, the task isn’t <em>that</em> daunting for Democrats. Our model calculates that Democrats would be favored to keep the House if they win the House popular vote — or lose it by less than 0.7 percentage points — something that Democrats did in both 2018 and 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, Democrats are down by only about 2 points in our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current average of generic-ballot polls</a>. Given the inherent error in polling, and how much time there is between now and November, it isn’t hard to turn a 2-point deficit in the polls into a 1-point win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, in important ways, that 2-point deficit understates the degree of trouble that Democrats are in. One reason is because many of those polls are conducted among registered voters rather than likely voters, and the electorate that turns out in November is likely to be more Republican than the broader universe of all registered voters. Historically, the patterns in midterm elections are that: 1) Republicans turn out more than Democrats, and 2) voters for whichever party doesn’t control the presidency are more enthusiastic and turn out more. In 2018, those factors canceled one another out. Democrats, not controlling the presidency, were the more enthusiastic party, helping to neutralize the Republicans’ historical turnout advantage. This year, though, they both work in the favor of Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thus, the model adjusts those registered-voter polls based on its estimate of what likely-voter polls would show, and when it does that, the Republicans’ generic-ballot lead is really more like 4 points than 2 points. I should note that this adjustment is not rigid in the model. Although the model uses historical turnout patterns as its baseline assumption, it will override that based on polls. In other words, if polls come out showing Democrats holding their own among likely voters — such as because of increased Democratic enthusiasm in the wake of Roe being overturned — the model will adjust to reflect that. Put another way, a very strong turnout would give Democrats a fighting chance of keeping the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But also, the generic ballot isn’t the only input that the model considers, and some of the other factors look worse for Democrats than the generic ballot does. Based on the historical tendency for the president’s party to lose seats in the midterms and Biden’s poor approval rating, for instance, the situation is more likely to get worse for Democrats than better. The model also evaluates factors such as polling and fundraising data in individual races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, the Deluxe forecast expects Democrats to eventually lose the popular vote for the House by closer to 6 points, about the margin that they lost it by in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014</a>. And it expects Republicans to wind up with 237 seats in an average outcome, a gain of 24 seats from the 213 they had at the start of the current Congress.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wouldn’t be a catastrophically bad result for Democrats by historical standards — Republicans gained 63 seats in 2010, and Democrats gained 41 in 2018. But that partly reflects that there are so few competitive House seats in a highly polarized country, especially after the redistricting process. Moreover, Republicans already won a number of competitive House seats in 2020, so there isn’t as much low-hanging fruit for them as in previous midterm years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

The Classic version of our model, which leaves out the expert ratings — sacrificing the additional accuracy they add but sticking to purely quantitative factors — tells a similar story, with Democrats also having a 12 percent chance of keeping the House. The Lite version of our model, meanwhile, which tries to forecast as much as it can based on polls alone, does paint a more optimistic picture for Democrats, giving them a 22 percent chance of keeping the House. But that version leaves out a lot of useful information, especially given that there isn’t much polling in a number of competitive House races.</p>



<h2><strong>The Senate</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic hopes of keeping the Senate are much more viable, however. Part of this, as I mentioned, is because they appear to have stronger candidates in a handful of key races. Pennsylvania, for instance — which is an open seat after the retirement of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey — is ordinarily the sort of seat that you’d expect Republicans to win since Pennsylvania is a purple state in a Republican year. However, the Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, is ahead of Republican Mehmet Oz, the doctor and TV personality, in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every poll conducted so far</a>. The model, though, is trained to be a bit skeptical given the fundamentals of the race, so it hedges against those polls and, at this point, has determined that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania is best thought of as a toss-up</a>. Still, that means Democrats have roughly a 50-50 chance of <em>gaining</em> a GOP-held Senate seat, offsetting potential losses elsewhere.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, our forecast sees the overall Senate landscape to be about as competitive as it gets. The Deluxe forecast literally has Senate control as a 50-50 tossup. The Classic and Lite forecasts show Democrats as very slight favorites to keep the Senate, meanwhile, with a 59 and a 62 percent chance, respectively.</p>

Raphael Warnock’s seat in Georgia that were won in off-year special elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> a mediocre year for Democrats in which they lost the popular vote for the House and also lost Senate races in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona. Of the 35 Senate seats up for grabs in November, 21 are currently held by Republicans. True, most of these are not competitive, but in addition to their chances to gain a GOP-held seat in Pennsylvania, Democrats also have credible chances in Wisconsin and North Carolina (and outside chances in Ohio and Florida, although those are a stretch given how GOP-leaning both states have become).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans don’t have any surefire pickups, meanwhile. Our model regards their best chances as being in Georgia, but that race is rated as a toss-up. And the races in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire</a> merely lean toward the Democratic incumbent, meaning they are still highly plausible GOP pickup opportunities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the picture isn’t as bad as you might expect for Democrats. If the political environment really deteriorates for them, they’ll be in trouble, lose most of the competitive races and even blue states like Colorado could come into play. But if things are merely<em> pretty bad</em> for Democrats instead of catastrophic, the outcome of the Senate will remain uncertain enough that stronger candidates could make the difference for them.</p>



<h2><strong>The Governors’ Mansions</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to talk about gubernatorial races on a systematic basis since there’s no particular prize for winning a majority of governorships. But, for the record, our model does run these calculations, and the Deluxe version estimates that there’s an 83 percent chance that Republicans end up with a majority of governorships following this November’s elections, compared with a 7 percent chance for Democrats. (There is an 10 percent chance that neither party has a majority.) However, a lot of these governorships are in smaller, lower-population states, and the model thinks there’s a 73 percent chance that the majority of the U.S. population will reside in states run by Democratic governors.</p>

Indeed, partisanship matters less in gubernatorial races than in races for Congress, even if it matters more than it once did. Consider, for instance, that there are currently Democratic governors in Kansas and Louisiana and Republican ones in Massachusetts and Maryland, although several of those seats could flip parties this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, incumbency is a powerful force in gubernatorial races. For instance, even though Michigan is a slightly red-leaning state, its incumbent Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a clear favorite against a Republican field marred by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/05/1103144991/5-republicans-are-off-the-michigan-gubernatorial-ballot-after-signature-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraudulent attempts to access the ballot</a> and the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/fbi-raids-home-of-michigan-republican-gubernatorial-candidate-ryan-kelley?ref=scroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrest of a leading candidate</a> for his participation in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Meanwhile, Wisconsin’s Tony Evers, also a Democratic incumbent, is a favorite against a Republican field where the most likely nominee is Rebecca Kleefisch, the former lieutenant governor. This is the sort of race where abortion could matter: Technically, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/24/overturning-roe-sets-stage-wisconsins-1849-ban-take-effect/7703590001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin’s 173-year-old abortion ban</a> — which outlaws all abortions, except in cases to save the life of the mother — is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now in effect</a> following the Dobbs decision, although the Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul has said he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-wisconsin-431bdc117a5ca8a9608d1ba8250f6084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t enforce the ban</a>.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Evers have also mounted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GovEvers/status/1541849090987884544" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a legal challenge&lt;/a&gt; to strike down the ban, and Evers has &lt;a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/evers-tells-convention-rally-hell-grant-clemency-to-docs-convicted-under-wisconsin-abortion-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;promised to pardon&lt;/a&gt; any doctors convicted of performing an abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>27</sup></a> But Kleefisch has <a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/views-on-abortion-to-shake-up-campaigns-upcoming-elections-in-wisconsin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said she opposes abortion</a> even in cases of rape and incest.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Republicans also have some strongly positioned incumbents. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an 86 percent favorite</a> to hold on against Democrat Stacey Abrams, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 95 percent favorite</a> against Democrat Beto O’Rourke. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a co-favorite with former President Donald Trump</a> to be the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, is also <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 94 percent favorite</a> to win a second term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps the most important gubernatorial race is in Pennsylvania, an open-seat race as the Democratic incumbent governor, Tom Wolf, is term-limited. There, the Republican nominee, Doug Mastriano, was present outside the Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/inq2/doug-mastriano-pennsylvania-2020-election-denial-timeline-20220609.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked to overturn Biden’s win in Pennsylvania</a>, potentially yielding a constitutional crisis if he’s governor in Pennsylvania and the election outcome is close again there in 2024. But <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastriano is an underdog</a> against Democrat Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania attorney general.</p>

<h2><strong>Changes to the model</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, we’re happy with our congressional and gubernatorial forecasts, which last underwent a major revision before the 2018 elections. They performed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2018-midterm-forecasts-did/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very well in 2018</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-forecasts-did-and-what-well-be-thinking-about-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fairly well in 2020</a> (despite a challenging year for the polls in 2020; it helped that our model also considers a number of other factors in addition to the polling). Therefore, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall methodology is largely the same</a>. However, after assessing the performance of the models, we did make a few changes around the margins:</p>



<ol><li><strong>In evaluating fundraising for congressional candidates, the model now places more emphasis on contributions received within the candidate’s state.</strong> Fundraising is a highly nationalized activity these days; Democrats in California and New York regularly contribute to Senate campaigns like that of Democrat Jaime Harrison of South Carolina, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/11/politics/jaime-harrison-fundraising-record-south-carolina-senate-race/index.html">raised a record amount of money in 2020</a><strong> </strong>but nonetheless lost to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham by 10 percentage points. As such, our analysis finds that a dollar received from within a candidate’s state is about five times as valuable as a dollar received outside of it in predicting the eventual election outcome.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the value of fundraising as a predictive variable is not just because the money can be used to buy advertising and other services, but it’s also as an indicator of organic, grassroots support.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Harrison used money from California or New York to buy ads and hire staff, but that didn’t mean there was a groundswell of voters in South Carolina looking to support him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> That’s why the model now applies that ratio, multiplying any funds raised from voters within the candidate’s state by 5, when assessing which candidate has the fundraising edge.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>The model now puts more emphasis on basic partisanship as opposed to other fundamentals. </strong>The fundamentals component of our model, used in the Classic and Deluxe versions, evaluates a series of variables such as fundraising, incumbency, candidate experience, congressional voting records and even scandals to make a forecast. The formula is fairly complicated, so we tested a simple alternative in an era of high partisanship. Specifically, we looked at what would happen if you made a forecast based solely on the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/">partisan lean of a state or district</a>, plus generic-ballot results. For instance, if the generic ballot favors Republicans by 4 percentage points, and a state leans Republican by 3 points, you might expect the Republican to win there by 7 points. In testing this on 2018 and 2020 races, we found that the more complicated version of our fundamentals formula does outperform this simple alternative. But it’s pretty close, and a blend of the complicated and simple formulas does better than either one taken alone.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, in the new version of our model, the simple formula gets 35 percent of the weight in congressional races and 17.5 percent for gubernatorial races, while the complicated one gets 65 percent and 82.5 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> What this means is that state partisanship and the generic ballot will have more influence on our model going forward and the other fundamentals factors less, although they certainly matter some.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>We assume errors are more correlated from race to race</strong>. In presidential races, forecast and polling errors are highly correlated from state to state. It wasn’t a surprise that Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in 2016 given that he also won Michigan, for example, since the states are fairly similar demographically. (Accounting for this properly was a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/">big reason that FiveThirtyEight’s model gave Trump a better chance than others</a> in 2016.) This also holds in congressional races, though to a considerably lesser degree since there are different candidates on the ballot in each state. A scandal affecting the Republican candidate in Georgia won’t necessarily have any impact in Arizona, for instance. However, our analysis suggests that polling errors are becoming more correlated in congressional races, too. Certainly, 2020 was a prominent example given that Republicans won nearly every toss-up race for the House and that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/">polls for Congress had a strong overall bias toward Democrats</a>. Therefore, we’ve increased the degree to which race-by-race errors are assumed to be correlated in the model.<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same as increasing the overall amount of error in the forecast. Our technique for calculating forecast error is somewhat complicated, but to simplify, there’s a national component and a local component, where the local component applies only to one race and the national component applies to all races across the board. In this year’s version of the model, we’ve increased the national error but &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt; the local error, meaning that the overall forecast error is about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a></li></ol><ol start="4"><li><strong>We’ve reduced the emphasis on sample size when weighting polls. </strong>This is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/">consistent with a change in our pollster ratings methodology</a> and is explained in more detail there.</li></ol><ol start="5"><li><strong>We’ve removed </strong><strong>a </strong><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/"><strong>series of changes</strong></a><strong> in the 2020 model that were specific to the COVID-19</strong><strong> pandemic. </strong>Yes, I know the pandemic isn’t over yet, but voting will take place under far more normal conditions than in 2020.</li></ol><p data-paragraph="main">Finally, a couple pieces of housekeeping. A number of states haven’t held their primaries yet, so in those cases, we guess at the most likely nominees based on polling, fundraising and other factors. These “presumed nominees” are designated with an asterisk in the interactive. If you see anything egregiously wrong — such as a candidate listed as a presumptive nominee when they’ve dropped out of the race — <a href="mailto:polls@fivethirtyeight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">please drop us a line</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’re also still thinking about how best to handle Alaska, which has a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Top-four_primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new system in place this year</a> in which the top-four finishers in the primary advance to the general election regardless of political party, and then the general election outcome is determined by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-alaskas-special-election-create-an-opening-for-sarah-palins-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting</a> (or, as some call it, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/might-this-be-good-time-for-instant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an instant runoff</a>) if no candidate receives a majority. This is not entirely dissimilar to the way elections are conducted in Louisiana, in which all candidates from all parties appear on the ballot in a blanket nonpartisan primary in November, and then there’s a runoff later between the top-two candidates if no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote. In fact, we’re currently taking a bit of a shortcut by using the Louisiana code for Alaska, essentially treating the instant runoff as though it’s an actual runoff where voters go to the polls again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We may revisit this assumption later, but it does avoid one potential pitfall. In Alaska’s House, Senate and gubernatorial races, it’s fairly likely that we’ll end up with one Democratic candidate but two or three Republican candidates following the Aug. 16 primaries. If the Republican vote is divided two or three ways, it may well be that the Democrat initially receives the plurality of the vote. However, this lead is unlikely to survive the instant-runoff process assuming voters for one Republican rank the other Republicans ahead of any Democrat. The process we use for Louisiana assumes that votes mostly tend to stay within the same party in the event of a runoff, and this same assumption is in place in Alaska. Thus, we have Republicans as fairly heavy favorites in the Alaska races, although the new system introduces some uncertainty.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The forecast itself will update continuously whenever new polls or other information are added to our database. We’ll also publish a written update to the forecast once per week or so, usually on Fridays, to review new data and other changes in the landscape, before upping the frequency as the election draws closer. We hope you’ll regularly visit FiveThirtyEight as part of your midterms rotation.</p>]]></description>
