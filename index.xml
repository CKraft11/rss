<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): We know the 2022 midterm elections haven’t happened yet, but this summer has seen an unusual amount of activity on the 2024 front. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Namely, many Americans, including Democrats, are <em>really</em> down on the idea of President Biden <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-unusually-lukewarm-about-a-second-biden-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking a second term</a>, while former President Donald Trump continues to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/technology/trump-search-misinfo-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominate the news cycle</a>. A sizable portion of Americans say they <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/07/2024-biden-trump-worst-thing-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t want Biden or Trump to have a second term</a>, but is there, uh … a path for anyone who isn’t Trump or Biden in 2024?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s tackle this chat in two parts:</p>



<ol><li>First, what is the case for — or against — any other Democratic presidential candidate breaking through?</li><li>And second, what is the case for — or against — any other Republican presidential candidate breaking through?</li></ol><p data-paragraph="main">OK, first up. Is there a Democrat who can take on Biden?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): I don’t think so, Sarah, <em>especially</em> if Trump is the nominee. If Trump announces that he’s running for a second term, I think: 1) Biden will run again, and 2) there won’t be a damaging primary to take him down. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What Democrat is going to take Biden on against Trump? Democrats will coalesce around the nominee who can beat Trump, and Biden has already proved that he can.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): I’m generally someone who thinks the 2024 nominations are Biden’s and Trump’s if they want them, but I think Biden is particularly safe. There just isn’t an obvious Democratic heir apparent. The closest thing is Vice President Kamala Harris, and she’s not going to run against her own running mate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Right, Nathaniel. I just don’t see notable Democrats wanting to participate in a messy, protracted primary against the sitting president. It would be a terrible look for the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/kaleigh-rogers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleigh Rogers</a>, tech and politics reporter): It’s no secret that the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/biden-2024-democrats-search-for-alternative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic bench isn’t very deep</a>, and I’m not sure a serious candidate would want to challenge the sitting president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In an earlier time, I could maybe see Sen. Bernie Sanders stepping up to the plate and attracting a decent share of the vote, but in 2024, I don’t think he’d bother, or be successful.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Sanders has <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-2024/40285647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already said</a> that he will not run against Biden. (They’re friends!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> More like frenemies. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Ugh, we need <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/24/politics/cory-booker-andrew-yang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more political</a> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/10/29/elizabeth-warren-julian-castro-friendship-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friendship stories</a>. …</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst): That’s a good point, Alex, about Democrats likely not wanting to participate in a messy primary. The order of operations to all this is very important. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Trump looms large, that may encourage greater Democratic unity. Regardless, though, it’s very hard to take on an incumbent president in a primary — no incumbent has ever lost renomination in the modern presidential primary era. There have been some primary polls testing Biden against a multicandidate field that <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/HHP_July2022_KeyResults.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have him leading</a> but <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Midterm2022ToplinesMay2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only in the 30s</a> in terms of support. However, I don’t think a crowded field would develop if Biden were running again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, and the incumbent presidents who have faced serious renomination fights (e.g., former President Jimmy Carter) lost their subsequent general election. No Democrat will want to be blamed for tanking Biden’s chances against Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another complication: I know polls show that Democrats largely don’t want Biden to run again, but party elites aren’t acting that way. Just look at the <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/08/03/maloney-attempts-to-clean-up-comments-about-biden-s-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hubbub that ensued</a> after Rep. Carolyn Maloney said she didn’t think Biden would run again in 2024. Her primary opponents jumped all over her, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/carolyn-maloney-apologizes-to-joe-biden-for-saying-he-won-t-run-in-2024#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she had to apologize</a>! To me, that’s the sign of a party united behind their leader. (It’s almost Trump-like!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Yeah, I don’t see anyone running <em>if</em> Biden makes good on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/22/biden-confirm-2024-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his stated intention to run again</a>. But I like to imagine alternate-universe scenarios since “no one” is not a very thrilling answer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Well, if Trump doesn’t run, then I think Biden <em>maybe </em>doesn’t run. (“Maybe” is doing a lot of work here.) But to your point, Kaleigh, that opens the door for other Democrats to enter the race. It’s just that no obvious candidate comes to mind for me currently.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I’m not fully convinced that Biden saying he will run means he actually will. It would be a really bad look for the sitting president to openly say, “Yeah, no, I’m good with one term,” <em>especially</em> at this point in his presidency. But as Alex points out, if for some reason Trump doesn’t run, that does give Biden a chance to step back at the end of this term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yeah, I was going to say there are a couple of pretty big assumptions baked in here. The first is that Trump will in fact be the nominee — we’ll debate that more in a bit!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the second is that Biden actually runs again, as Kaleigh just said. That calculus could change as we get closer to 2024 and Trump isn’t the nominee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, Sarah, I would be surprised if a prominent Democrat runs against Biden. I wouldn’t be surprised, though, if he declines to run for reelection. He would be 86 years old by the end of his second term; it’s just really hard to imagine him serving at that age.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Because campaign decisions don’t always happen in an orderly fashion, it’ll be interesting to see how long Biden waits before he makes a final determination about his 2024 intentions. If Trump jumps in quickly before this November’s election or just after it, Biden will have plenty of time to decide. But if Trump were to unexpectedly wait to announce — or were even to float the idea he won’t run — that could complicate Biden’s decision-making process if he is considering not running again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I guess I’m just skeptical that Biden would throw in the towel without an obvious heir apparent — despite his age.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> I know it’s incredibly early still, but general-election polls show that one of Biden’s strongest factors as a candidate is his performance against Trump, right?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, Sarah, I think Biden definitely benefits from a perception that he is still one of Democrats’ most electable options. (After all, he beat Trump in 2020.) But I’m not sure how much the data backs that up. According to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/585432015/20220801-yahoo-tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Yahoo News poll</a> from the beginning of the month, registered voters picked Biden over Trump 45 percent to 42 percent. But they also picked Harris over Trump 45 percent to 44 percent. That’s not a significant difference. And that’s before even getting into the fact that 2024 is two years away and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early general-election polls are pretty meaningless</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> It largely depends on the pollster as to whether Biden leads or Trump leads, but on balance, Biden may lead slightly more often than not. I do think, though, some Democrats believe anyone other than Biden might be weaker against Trump. It’s a question of the known vs. the unknown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Maybe part of the calculus against Biden seeking a second term is that Democrats just don’t want him to, as Nathaniel and Sarah hinted at earlier. A July <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-president-joe-biden-approval-rating-july-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll</a> found that Biden is facing his lowest approval rating since taking office — and Democrats are a large part of the reason why. Per the survey, Biden’s overall approval rating sits at 36 percent, a <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-president-joe-biden-approval-rating-july-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4-percentage-point drop from the end of June</a>. Most of the discontent appears to be coming within Biden’s own party, too. There was a 9-point decline among Democrats between the two polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, 75 percent of Democrats said they approve of the job Biden is doing as president. Compare that with the previous month, though, when 84 percent of Democrats felt the same. And surprising no one, his approval rating among Republican voters is much, much lower. In July, only 5 percent of Republicans and 28 percent of independent voters approved of the job Biden is doing (which is on par with how Republicans felt in late June, too).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Is it unusual that Biden is this unpopular, especially among members of his own party?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Well, on the one hand, presidential approval <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/cruel-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often declines</a> in a president’s first term. I’d bet, too, that Democrats were especially optimistic after Biden beat Trump and Democrats won majorities in the House and Senate, but that they were then disappointed after Biden’s administration failed to address a number of key issues he campaigned on, e.g., <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062070001/student-loan-forgiveness-debt-president-biden-campaign-promise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a student loan forgiveness program</a>, an overhaul of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/8-experts-say-biden-administration-is-failing-on-immigration-2022-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. immigration system</a>, etc. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, Biden has had to continue navigating America’s response to the pandemic, which has been messy, along with unexpected events like <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/23/statement-by-president-biden-on-russias-unprovoked-and-unjustified-attack-on-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine</a> and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/14/biden-economy-afl-cio-00039580" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faltering economy</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> The fact, though, that Biden’s approval rating is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at 70 to 75 percent among Democrats</a> is unusual. <a href="https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/trump-job-approval/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=100&amp;mindate=2000-01-01&amp;maxdate=2022-08-17&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=yes&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A,A%20-%20D,A%20-%20i,RV,RV%20-%20D,RV%20-%20i,LV,LV%20-%20D,LV%20-%20i&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=approve,disapprove&amp;fudge=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Both Trump</a> and former President <a href="https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=100&amp;mindate=2008-01-01&amp;maxdate=2022-08-17&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=no&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A,A%20-%20R,A%20-%20i,RV,RV%20-%20R,RV%20-%20i,LV,LV%20-%20R,LV%20-%20i&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=approve,disapprove&amp;fudge=0.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barack Obama</a> usually had approval ratings of at least 80 percent or more among members of their own party, although they did occasionally dip below that mark. Where Biden goes from here — back up or stagnant — could be important to determining whether he runs again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Not to mention that until very recently Biden also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the lowest approval rating</a> of any president since the end of World War II. It’s slowly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inched back up</a>, but he’s still underwater overall.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But OK, a lot of you have said there is “no heir apparent” when it comes to a Democrat who isn’t Biden. This isn’t a 2024 draft — soon, right? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉"> — but what does the Democratic bench look like <em>if</em> Biden doesn’t run?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> If Biden’s not at the table, then Harris is an obvious choice. Not only is she veep, but also she held her own during the 2020 primaries and could follow a similar trajectory as Biden himself did, using his record during the Obama administration to build out the basic platform planks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah, Kaleigh. Any discussion of Democratic candidates beyond Biden has to start with Harris. Sitting vice presidents who run to succeed their presidential ticket-mate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-had-to-fight-for-the-presidential-nomination-but-most-vps-have-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost always win the party’s nomination</a>. You’d have to go back to Democratic Vice President Alben Barkley <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/politicaljunkie/2009/07/on_this_day_in_1952_vp_alben_b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 1952</a> — so prior to the modern primary era — to find one who didn’t. Granted, the last person in this situation was Vice President Al Gore in 2000, and he, of course, didn’t end up winning the general election. So there is that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> But Harris’s 2020 campaign <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happened-to-the-kamala-harris-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t great</a>. That said, I did find this survey interesting: A May <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/key-results-may/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard University/Harris poll</a> shows that 19 percent of Democratic and independent voters would want Harris to run if Biden doesn’t seek a second term. (She was voters’ top choice). After Harris, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton (!!) and Sanders both came in at 10 percent, while U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg netted 7 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The only problem for Harris is that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her approval rating</a> is even lower than Biden’s right now. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png?w=1424 2x"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> True, Sarah. Democrats do have other options, though. Buttigieg clearly wants to be president too, and he doesn’t have an obvious other office to run for. Democrats also have a fairly deep bench of governors and such who could run if they want — Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Jared Polis of Colorado, etc.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK. Is it fair to say that we’re all in agreement that there is not room for anyone else in the Democratic primary aside from Biden — unless, of course, he doesn’t run?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> The fact that no one easily comes to mind tells me … yes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, time to talk about the Republican side of things. Is there room for any one else other than Trump?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-republican-rally-ron-desantis-kari-lake-blake-masters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/29/pence-iowa-2024-campaign-00048716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Vice President Mike Pence</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2021/magazine-nikki-haleys-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley</a>, <a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/political-news/2022-03-12/former-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-makes-another-trip-to-iowa-raising-2024-speculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2022/08/11/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-flips-pork-chops-iowa-state-fair-talks-2024-prospects-gop-donald-trump/10298565002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan</a> all seem to be lining up to run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of those, DeSantis is the only one who (currently) seems capable of defeating Trump should the former president indeed run. In fact, if Pence, Haley, Pompeo and Hogan were all to run, that would arguably be good for Trump. After all, we saw in 2016 that the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/primaries/explaining-the-presidential-primary-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican primaries’ use</a> of winner-take-all or winner-take-most delegate systems helped Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/25/donald-trump-is-now-just-a-handful-of-delegates-from-truly-clinching-the-gop-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty handily win the nomination</a> with only a <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plurality of the primary vote</a>. So if you get a number of candidates splitting up the vote not going for Trump, it’s just going to make it easier for him to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> The Republican ticket is a little more interesting. You’re not challenging a sitting president, and there certainly seems to be at least <em>some</em> hesitancy over Trump and the idea that he has too much baggage and might not be able to win in a general election … again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/us/politics/trump-approval-polling-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> from last month found, for instance, that almost half of Americans who planned to vote in the 2024 Republican primary would choose a candidate other than Trump in a primary race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yesssss, Kaleigh. I’m glad you brought up that poll, because I thought that was an interesting way to frame the results, as one could also argue from that poll that Trump is still the undisputed leader. He was first, with 49 percent support, and DeSantis was in second, at 25 percent. No other candidate broke the double digits.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> There is definitely more room for a challenger to Trump than to Biden, but Trump would still be favored. According to a recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/11/fbi-raid-increases-trumps-2024-primary-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult poll</a>, 56 percent of Republican and independent registered voters said they would support Trump, while 18 percent said they would support DeSantis, 8 percent said they would support Pence and a bunch of other candidates all got 2 percent or less. Even if you look at head-to-head matchups between Trump and DeSantis, Trump wins, albeit by a narrower margin. According to that YouGov/Yahoo News poll I mentioned earlier, Trump beats DeSantis 44 percent to 35 percent among registered voters in a direct matchup.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Absolutely, but this point (from the Times reporting on the poll) was an interesting comparison to me: “His share of the Republican primary electorate is less than Hillary Clinton’s among Democrats was at the outset of the 2016 race.” Of course, Clinton ultimately won that race, but it wasn’t a guarantee — Sanders gave her a real run for her money.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Eh, Kaleigh, you can cherry-pick one historical example to make basically whatever point you want to make. The Times could have also compared Trump to Gore’s position in 1999. He, of course, went on to win the primary without much trouble.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, DeSantis is clearly a legitimate threat to Trump; a 9-point lead in the polls is not secure. That’s especially true since Trump has universal name recognition, while DeSantis doesn’t. That implies he has more room to grow.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I know we had a chat back in the day about whether <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trumps-hold-on-the-gop-still-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s grip on the GOP is still strong</a>. At the time, I said that Trump may be weaker than some would like to admit, but after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuesday night’s results</a> — most notably Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s primary loss coupled with the fates of the nine other Republicans who voted to impeach the former president — I actually think it’ll be really hard for another Republican to cut through his power. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, Trump hasn’t won every race he’s got involved in (think <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/26/donald-trump-georgia-kemp-raffensperger/9922677002/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp</a> or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-cheney-and-murkowski-survive-their-trump-backed-primary-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski</a>, who will each advance to the general election), but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-candidate-lost-in-nebraska-but-trump-is-still-winning-most-of-his-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he still has a pretty good track record overall</a> of endorsing candidates that win. Moreover, I just don’t see an obvious heir apparent to the GOP, either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>What you all are saying is<strong> </strong>fair, but do you all not see any evidence of Republicans getting nervous about Trump as a candidate?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The reality is that it’s just very hard to answer this question definitively. I do think we’ve seen some cracks in Trump’s influence, as we debated earlier this year. Polls like the one from The New York Times you<strong> </strong>cited earlier, Kaleigh, also clearly show that Trump isn’t entirely unopposed. There are more subtle things happening behind the scenes, too, like Fox News and the Murdoch conservative empire <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/07/30/rupert-lachlan-murdoch-donald-trump-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly distancing themselves from Trump</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s still too early to place any stock <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in these general-election polls</a>, but we’re not <em>too</em> far away from the point when early primary polls will be useful, and what we’ve seen in our analysis of 40-plus years of early primary polls is that it’s really hard for people who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t household names to break through</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">We knew early on, for instance, that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-weve-gleaned-about-the-democratic-primary-from-6-months-of-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden was the front-runner</a>. So the question for me now is whether anyone on the Republican side can clear Trump’s name recognition, and I don’t know the answer to that … yet.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I think there’s at least some evidence Republicans are worried about Trump’s candidacy. A <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-losing-gop-support-2024-run-jan-6-hearings-unfold-poll-1727112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos poll from July</a> found that about a third of Republicans said Trump should not run again, and that’s an increase from six weeks earlier, when they asked the same question and just 26 percent of Republicans said Trump shouldn’t run. That said, a majority of Republicans disagreed with the idea that Trump should not run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All I’m saying, though, is there may be a little more room for a challenger on the GOP side than on the Democratic side if the presumptive candidate runs again. I wonder, too, whether <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2022/trump-lawsuits-investigations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s protracted legal troubles</a> will affect the share of Republicans who don’t want him to run. Maybe. Maybe not. At any rate, Republicans will likely still face an uphill battle in overcoming Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> For me, it comes down to whether Trump still has <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a favorability rating north of 80 percent among Republicans</a>. Because polls at this point are still largely telling us that Republicans would vote for Trump if he ran again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Admittedly, Republicans don’t yet know the alternatives that will be available to them. But considering <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jun/14/most-republicans-falsely-believe-trumps-stolen-ele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around two-thirds</a> of Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t believe Trump lost</a> in the first place, it’s not hard to imagine a lot of them still backing him once we get into the presidential primary season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> It’s still <em>very</em> early, though! Someone like DeSantis, for instance, has to win his governor’s race first before he can go all in on 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But say Trump did announce now, though, or in the lead-up to the midterms, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/politics/trump-republicans-campaign-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as has been hinted</a>, that would be kind of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-first-2020-candidate-is-hold-on-i-had-the-name-right-here-john-delaney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a John Delaney move</a>, no? Like a little <em>too</em> thirsty?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I’m not sure his supporters would see it that way, Sarah. To them, it might just be starting the party early.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Fair. OK, where do folks stand on this question of whether there’s room for someone other than Trump in the GOP? I think there might be more disagreement?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> It’s pretty clear that there is some room for a Trump challenger. The question is just whether there’s enough, and if so, whether the opposition will be too divided to take advantage of it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I think there is space for a challenger in the GOP, but that challenger will still have a real hard time overcoming Trump’s popularity, and if there’s more than one challenger splitting the few non-Trump votes, it will be a snowball’s-chance-in-hell scenario.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> I haven’t had a chance to dig into old primary polling data yet regarding this question, but DeSantis’s situation strikes me as interesting. He’s a first-term governor who was only a three-term House member before that, yet he’s already polling pretty well in national polls of GOP presidential primary voters. That’s unusual! And I do think it means that he has a pretty high ceiling of potential support even against Trump, and that he maybe could best Trump in a largely head-to-head matchup. But as we’ve all noted at this point, the more candidates, the better it probably is for Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Hmm, I don’t know. I just don’t think there’s an obvious GOP heir to Trump. I know other names have been mentioned, but they just don’t have the same power over voters that Trump currently has.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday was a test for some big names in the Republican Party in Wyoming and Alaska. Most notably, Rep. Liz Cheney lost her primary to Harriet Hageman in Wyoming by an even wider margin than expected. Of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, only two will advance to the November general election, as the other eight have either retired or lost their midterm primaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses what Cheney might do next with her message and what an independent bid for president might entail. They also look at the early vote tallies in Alaska to get a sense of whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski will win the general election and whether former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin will be headed to Washington too.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s political future <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-liz-cheney-cant-rely-on-democrats-to-save-her-in-wyomings-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had long been in jeopardy</a>. From voting to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to <a href="https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1389225154639695881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly refuting</a> his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, Cheney has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-trump-election-falsehood/2021/05/01/7bd380a0-a921-11eb-8c1a-56f0cb4ff3b5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Trump’s harshest critics</a>. Now that outspokenness has come with a price.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The daughter of one of America’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2009/01/15/99422633/cheney-a-vp-with-unprecedented-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most powerful vice presidents</a> lost to her main primary challenger, attorney Harriet Hageman, by around 20 points, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wyoming-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=88249850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on incomplete returns</a> as of 10:30 p.m. Eastern. Hageman’s path to victory was pretty straightforward. She entered the race against Cheney <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-effort-unseat-rep-liz/story?id=79922266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Trump’s endorsement</a> and consolidated support among most anti-Cheney primary voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while Cheney’s loss is particularly high-profile, it is not surprising. Of the 10 House Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who voted to impeach Trump</a>, only two advanced to the general election, four lost their primaries and four didn’t even try to seek reelection, retiring instead.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A question we had going into this primary cycle was just how many pro-impeachment Republicans would still be in the House in 2023. The answer we now know is two at most. Republicans may say in polls that the GOP <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/03/11/biden-viewed-positively-on-many-issues-but-public-is-less-confident-he-can-unify-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should accept elected Republicans who <em>disagree</em> with the party</a>, but there is clearly little appetite for those who have rebuked Trump in this way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, in analyzing why these representatives lost — or narrowly prevailed, in the case of Reps. David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington — there are few clear patterns. The electoral impact of the impeachment vote ranged across the ideological spectrum, from districts that lean Democratic to those that are solidly Republican. For instance, Valadao hailed from the bluest seat of this group, while Newhouse survived in a considerably red district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it’s probably <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/07/24/top-two-primary-in-washington-dethrones-trump-00047532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a coincidence</a> that both Valadao and Newhouse won in states that use a top-two primary system. In that format, all voters can cast a ballot that includes every candidate, regardless of party, whereas party primaries mostly involve voters who are either registered with that party or generally back it and who are voting only for candidates from one party. Still, Valadao, the only pro-impeachment Republican running who didn’t face a Trump-endorsed challenger, <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2022-primary/sov/86-congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely edged out</a> fellow Republican Chris Mathys, <a href="https://www.ourvalleyvoice.com/2021/04/16/chris-mathys-holds-town-hall-in-campaign-against-valadao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ardent Trump supporter</a>, 26 percent to 23 percent for second place in his top-two primary.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrat in the race took first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> Newhouse didn’t do much better, essentially tying with the lone Democrat in the race with <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20220802/congressional-district-4-us-representative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 percent</a>.<br></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, not a single pro-impeachment Republican captured a majority of the GOP primary vote. This amounts to an especially weak set of performances for incumbents, who in most cases easily win their primaries.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It also suggests that Valadao and Newhouse’s survival involved at least a little luck. The fact that Valadao faced two <a href="https://www.bakersfield.com/news/candidates-color-outside-partisan-lines-in-purple-district/article_349eeb16-d32d-11ec-a962-a306c4d7037e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-Trump opponents</a>, neither of whom landed the former president’s endorsement, likely made it easier for him to squeak out a victory compared with someone like Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan’s 3rd District, who faced one <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-congress-michigan-grand-rapids-impeachments-bfbb4564f73f2afdda6c5dbcb969c4ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-backed challenger and narrowly</a> lost <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michigan-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=87750801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent to 48 percent</a>. Similarly, had Newhouse faced just one pro-Trump challenger instead of several, he may have been doomed, as collectively his Republican opponents won nearly half of the top-two primary vote — about twice what Newhouse garnered. But instead, they split the anti-Newhouse vote, and he survived.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Factors besides Trump, though, played at least some role in these primaries. For instance, in the two bluest seats on this list — those contested by Valadao and Meijer — <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2022-07-13/essential-politics-democrats-buying-ads-gop-far-right-candidates-essential-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary meddling</a> by Democratic-aligned groups may have had an effect on the outcome. Take Mathys. He didn’t have Trump’s endorsement, but <a href="https://sjvsun.com/news/politics/in-battle-against-valadao-chris-mathys-gets-a-big-lift-from-nancy-pelosi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside spending</a> by House Majority PAC, an important campaign arm for House Democrats, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;id=1153696525417340&amp;view_all_page_id=228754857151053&amp;search_type=page&amp;media_type=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran ads touting</a> Mathys’s support for Trump. And in Michigan’s 3rd District, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent nearly $450,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/x5XVRDC50Do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running ads attacking</a> Gibbs as “too conservative for west Michigan” at a time when he <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=MI03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had almost no outside help</a> to combat <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meijer’s huge spending edge</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Outside forces aside from Trump also likely influenced the four Republicans who said they wouldn’t seek reelection. Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-will-survive-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced a serious primary challenge</a> from former Trump aide Max Miller, but he also faced redistricting uncertainty, reflected in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/senate_gop_proposal_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial plan</a> drawn by Ohio Republicans that split Gonzalez’s old seat into four different districts (it was <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/14/redistricting-ohio-supreme-court-decision-congressional-map-gerrymandering/9119566002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later thrown out by the state judiciary</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/revised_republican_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a>). Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger was in a similar boat, as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his district was dismantled</a> by Illinois Democrats. The same <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/john-katko-retiring-new-york-republican/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was true of New York Rep. John Katko</a>: New York Democrats sought to draw him into a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/amended_democratic_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluer district</a>, although the eventual map <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was invalidated</a> and replaced with one drawn by a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/court_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court-appointed expert</a>. And longtime Michigan Rep. Fred Upton <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/22/fred-upton-running-congress-tv-ads/6898798001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered running again</a> for a while, even though redistricting <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2021/12/michigans-longest-serving-congressman-fred-upton-placed-in-same-district-as-fellow-republican-bill-huizenga.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw him together</a> with more conservative Rep. Bill Huizenga, who <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2022/03/11/trump-endorses-huizenga-reelection-4th-district/7009427001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump ultimately backed</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet of the six incumbents who ultimately sought reelection, they didn’t necessarily enter their races as underdogs. All outspent their top primary opponents, and they usually had more outside help, too. It just wasn’t enough to overcome the anger within the GOP base over their impeachment votes. Tellingly, all six had faced some sort of official censure by a local and/or state party committee following their vote against Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to November, it’s possible the rebuke continues as only one House Republican out of the 10 who voted to impeach Trump is currently favored to make it to the next Congress. Given the red hue of Newhouse’s seat and the fact that he faces a Democrat in the general, the FiveThirtyEight 2022 election forecast <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/washington/4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puts him as <em>very likely</em> to win reelection</a>. But Valadao is in a tougher reelection fight, which <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s forecast</a> currently rates as a pure toss-up. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s likely Cheney as well as the nine other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump knew their vote was a potentially risky move for their political careers. But in January 2021, few would have predicted that only two would survive their primaries.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Conventional wisdom suggests that members of opposing political parties <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-really-really-dislike-biden-but-its-not-just-about-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t like each other</a> — and I mean <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>really </em>don’t like each other</a>. But what does it mean when members of your own party are seemingly aching to get you out of office too? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar must be asking herself that question <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ilhan-omar-squeaks-victory-tuesday-night-primary-surprises/story?id=88165446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after nearly losing her primary</a> on Aug. 9. She is a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member of the progressive group</a> of mostly women of color commonly known as “the Squad,” and a week rarely goes by without one of them making headlines: New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/style/aoc-met-gala-dress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly admonished</a> by both fans and critics for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/07/27/fact-check-aoc-arrested-during-protest-supreme-court/10117539002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged political stunts</a>; Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democratic-congresswoman-apologizes-distraction-caused-calling-trump-motherf-n956231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stirred controversy</a> in 2019 for dropping the F-bomb while calling for then-President Donald Trump’s impeachment; and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley <em>and </em>New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/reps-ayanna-pressley-jamaal-bowman-tweet-delete-defense-will-smiths-os-rcna21787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced blowback</a> in March for posting and then later deleting tweets that seemed to defend actor Will Smith for slapping comedian Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Omar isn’t the only one who’s attracted negative headlines over the years. But it does seem as if Omar routinely receives the most flak from both Republicans and<em> </em>Democrats. It’s a hard thing to quantify, but she may even be the Squad’s <em>most</em> controversial member.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, there is no one explanation for why Omar is seemingly so disliked. Perhaps more than her fellow Squad members, she has repeatedly questioned the U.S. government’s relationship with Israel in ways that have angered members of both parties. There was the time in 2019 when she responded to a tweet and said the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group, was “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/07/700901834/minnesota-congresswoman-ignites-debate-on-israel-and-anti-semitism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all about the Benjamins</a>,” a comment that angered lawmakers from her own party (not to mention the GOP) because it invoked historical anti-Semitic tropes linking Jewish people with money and power. Then there was the time in 2021 when she compared the actions of the U.S. and Israel to those of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57436573" target="_blank" rel="noopener">militant Islamist groups Hamas and the Taliban</a>. But it’s not just her criticism of U.S. policy on Israel; she’s also had problems with politics at home. In fact, her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/us/politics/ilhan-omar-policing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for a 2021 ballot initiative</a> to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety may have turned off moderate Democratic voters in her primary last Tuesday, for example. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many members of the Squad have experienced <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/14/trump-congress-go-back-where-they-came-from-1415692" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist attacks</a>, but as a Muslim woman born in Somalia, Omar may be uniquely vulnerable to a particularly toxic mix of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007372113/trump-biden-ilhan-omar-minnesota.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virulence and xenophobia</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The fact that Omar still wears the hijab is a reminder that she’s maybe ‘not one of us’ or that she’s different,” said <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/mdminta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Minta</a>, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, who specializes in congressional politics as well as race and ethnic politics. In fact, Omar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/ilhan-omar-hijab-congress-headwear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is the first to wear a hijab</a> in Congress, and while Minta did say that fellow Squad member Tlaib, who is also Muslim, sometimes wears <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46751362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional Palestinian clothes</a>, she doesn’t do it often. “Omar, on the other hand, is a visible representation of what Islam is. She’s also Black. And that intersection makes her a lightning rod,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Multiple Squad members have faced primary challengers this year. Omar and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/02/us/elections/results-missouri-us-house-district-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri</a> had four, Tlaib and Bowman had three<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowman had three challengers until one of them &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Jaffe4NY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suspended his campaign&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> but Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley had <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2022/02/02/massachusetts-congressional-races-draw-few-challenges-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none</a>. Only Omar has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/minnesota-2022-primary-results/story?id=88109247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come close to being defeated</a>. (We don’t yet know how Bowman will fare in his primary on Aug. 23, <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/04/bowman-challenger-vedat-gashi-announces-470k-initial-fundraising-haul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but fundraising suggests</a> he may have a fight on his hands.) Still, Bush <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/missouri-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=87750676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beat her nearest primary opponent</a> by about 43 percentage points; Tlaib won <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michigan-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=87750801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by about 41 points</a>. Omar, however, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/09/us/elections/results-minnesota-us-house-district-5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won by only 2 points</a>. In fact, Omar is the <em>only</em> Squad member to face back-to-back competitive primaries <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/31/18014442/midterms-election-2018-ilhan-omar-minnesota-5th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following her initial 2018 win.</a></p>

</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">Unpacking why Omar’s most recent primary was so close, though, is hard for the reasons I cited earlier. “Anti-Muslim sentiment certainly plays a role,” said <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/shadi-hamid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadi Hamid</a>, a senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution who studies the intersection of religion and politics. “But it’s hard to know <em>how </em>much it plays a role in this specific case because you would have to disentangle that from the fact that [Omar’s] outspoken; she’s controversial; she wears the hijab and talks about Israel more than most members of Congress.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The University of Minnesota’s Minta, however, pointed to a number of missteps Omar had made at home. <a href="https://www.startribune.com/divided-left-field-of-minneapolis-mayoral-hopefuls-have-unified-message-don-t-rank-frey/600107813/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For instance, she didn’t back</a> Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s reelection bid in part because he <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/rep-omar-endorses-2-frey-opponents-for-minneapolis-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t support the amendment change</a> to replace the city’s police department. Frey, in turn, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-mayor-jacob-frey-other-west-metro-mayors-endorse-don-samuels-over-rep-ilhan-omar/600195677/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Omar’s main primary opponent</a>, former Minneapolis City Council and school board member Don Samuels.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No relation to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> There’s not a ton of recent polling on Frey, but a <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/politics/minneapolis-voters-split-on-frey-unfavorable-view-of-city-council/89-9a1c639f-8072-4c4d-a85b-50cee01d8465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September survey suggests</a> that a majority of the city’s Black voters view him in a favorable light. “I think that having the incumbent mayor against you may have divided Omar’s coalition,” Minta said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Samuels also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ilhan-omar-faces-primary-challenger-hopes-find-weakness/story?id=88147930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly criticized</a> Omar for her support of replacing the city’s police department with a Department of Public Safety, a bid <a href="https://vote.minneapolismn.gov/results-data/election-results/2021/ballot-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which ultimately failed</a> by roughly 12 points in November. Minta told me that Omar’s support for this ballot measure could have angered Black and white voters who didn’t want to disband the police department but wanted to reform it instead. On top of that, Omar has continued to call <a href="https://ilhanomar.com/issue/criminal-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for police reform</a>, which puts her at odds with other Democrats in the area who have moved away from calling for sweeping police reform in the years after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-has-and-hasnt-changed-since-george-floyd-was-murdered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Floyd’s murder in police custody</a>. Frey, for example, once promised to reform and rebuild the city’s police department <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-mayor-freys-credibility-on-police-battered-by-false-claims-about-reform/600148638/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but later retreated</a> from this pledge. Samuels, meanwhile, attempted to make the race against Omar a referendum on that November vote <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/15/minnesota-policing-ilhan-omar-reelection-don-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by touting his past support</a> for more resources and better training for police officers versus annihilating the department completely. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Some Black activists in the past have argued that Omar is out of touch with the community, particularly as it relates to ‘defund the police,’” Minta said. “There was also an uptick in crime in some of the urban areas in and around the city around the time when this proposal was going around, and many people still wanted police on the streets to fight crime. As a result, the more progressive messaging on policing was not in sync with some of the city resident’s demands.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It may also be the case, though, that Omar just <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/09/ilhan-omar-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t take her primary challenge too seriously</a>. For instance, Omar and Samuels didn’t debate, and despite amassing a sizable war chest of her own — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/us/politics/ilhan-omar-faces-a-primary-challenge-in-her-minnesota-house-district.html" target="_blank">over $2.3 million</a> — Omar didn’t air any TV campaign ads against him. Samuels was also perhaps a surprisingly strong primary opponent. He had his own name recognition in the community as a longtime resident and activist of north Minneapolis and a former city council and school board member. He also <a href="https://www.startribune.com/samuels-outraises-omar-as-august-dfl-primary-approaches-according-to-new-campaign-finance-reports/600191471/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a lot of money</a> — though <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MN/05/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately less</a> than Omar — which boosted his overall campaign and had the backing of a number of establishment Democrats in the area, plus <a href="https://www.startribune.com/samuels-over-omar-in-dfl-primary/600194820/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the endorsement</a> of Minneapolis’s big newspaper, the Star Tribune, which put Omar in a tough spot even though she was the incumbent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Omar’s struggles at home don’t fully explain what happened last Tuesday or why Omar has faced a primary challenge each time she has sought reelection. Remember, she’s the only member of the Squad to face back-to-back challenges while other outspoken members, like Ocasio-Cortez, have run unopposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That brings us back to Omar’s identity. “She has these various identities that make her really susceptible to being targeted because she’s so visible,” said <a href="https://polisci.msu.edu/people/directory/lajevardi-nazita.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazita Lajevardi</a>, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies political behavior as well as race and ethnic politics. “She’s a woman, first and foremost; she’s Black; she’s veiled, and she’s an immigrant. These four things are in a sense competing for how she can be really attacked, and they make her particularly vulnerable.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Lajevardi told me that Omar’s identity is likely one reason why so many Democrats feel emboldened to challenge her. Omar’s image has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/02/poster-linking-rep-ilhan-omar-sparks-outrage-injuries-wva-state-capitol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used by Republicans</a> as <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/lauren-boebert-calls-rep-ilhan-203009186.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sort of bogey(wo)man</a> since she first won in 2018, and that, Lajevardi said, could buoy Democrats who want to similarly knock her down. It hasn’t helped, Lajevardi added, that establishment Democrats, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/10/ilhan-omar-democrats-harassment-silencing-israel-hamas-taliban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, have also <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/world/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-admonishes-freshman-rep-ilhan-omar-over-israel-tweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly admonished Omar</a>, which could also embolden moderate Democrats with similar views, like Samuels.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While it’s true that Omar’s criticism of Israel may go too far for many Democrats, Lajevardi stressed that as an immigrant woman, Omar’s comments on Israel might be interpreted differently than if they came from someone who was white or born in the United States. “Nativity is super important here because people seem to think that if she questions how the United States might be responsible for any sort of harm or violence abroad, then perhaps that means she’s not loyal to the United States,” Lajevardi said. “When she’s critical of Israel, people aren’t just listening to arguments of somebody being critical of Israel, but the image of her — her body politics and identity — matters, too, in shaping how that message is received.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Omar’s an easy target in a way that other Squad members just aren’t. She is a disruptive representative because of who she is and what ideas she represents. And because she built a coalition with the progressive arm of the Democratic Party, which has an uneasy relationship with the rest of the party, she is an easy scapegoat for both establishment Democrats and Republicans. “So will she get another challenge in 2024? Seems likely,” Minta said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Aug. 16, 1:37 p.m.):</strong> This story has been updated to explain that although no debate took place between Omar and Samuels, Omar’s campaign says she did not decline to debate him.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the past week, Democrats’ odds of keeping control of the Senate after the midterms have ticked up to around 60 percent, according to our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/?cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deluxe forecast model</a>. In this installment of “Model Talk” on the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Nate Silver and Galen Druke discuss the news events and polling that have contributed to this change. They also ask whether there is reason to expect the current environment to hold as we get closer to Election Day and whether we should be skeptical of the polls showing Democrats performing well in parts of the Midwest where polls have repeatedly underestimated Republicans.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For months, Aug. 16 was the most anticipated date on the primary calendar. Not one but two of the highest-profile Republican critics of former President Donald Trump are facing the voters this week, and everyone wanted to know if there was any place left for them in the Republican Party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But now, those primaries look kinda … boring. One of those anti-Trump Republicans is almost certain to advance to the general election, while the other is almost certain to lose. Instead, the most interesting races of the week are now those that had been flying under the radar, including a special election in which Alaska could send a Democrat to Congress. So let’s run down the two races everybody’s watching, plus four more that you should know about.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="949" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22202685107072-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22202685107072-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22202685107072-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22202685107072-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney is among Trump’s most high-profile Republican critics — which has made her seat vulnerable to the former president’s endorsee, Harriet Hageman. <p>Thomas Peipert / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Wyoming</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. House, secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, was the embodiment of Republican politics — until Trump came along. In early 2021, she voted to impeach him for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and she has since become the loudest anti-Trump voice within the Republican Party, most notably by serving as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the attack. And she has paid a price for it: In February 2021, the Wyoming Republican Party overwhelmingly voted to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-capitol-siege-censures-rawlins-wyoming-3d2a5ad3377bb748c22f632642ba23f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censure her</a>, and that May, her House colleagues voted to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/12/995072539/gop-poised-to-oust-cheney-from-leadership-over-her-criticism-of-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remove her</a> from party leadership. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And now she looks very likely to lose her primary for reelection to the <strong>House</strong> as well. Initially, <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1420482244334952448?s=20&amp;t=N5ExF8HQFQ6Ria1ckPNoZA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> showed her with a <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1420475475495854081?s=20&amp;t=N5ExF8HQFQ6Ria1ckPNoZA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting chance</a> thanks to a split opposition. However, last September, Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-effort-unseat-rep-liz/story?id=79922266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tapped</a> <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2022/08/10/harriet-hageman-profile-more-to-hageman-than-just-anti-cheney-pro-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney</a> Harriet Hageman as his pick, and three of Cheney’s other challengers <a href="https://sheridanmedia.com/news/58304/three-candidates-drop-out-of-wyoming-u-s-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> shortly thereafter. Though Hageman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/us/politics/harriet-hageman-liz-cheney-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to block</a> the Republican National Convention from nominating Trump in 2016, she has reinvented herself as a hard-core Trump supporter, all the way up to agreeing with his false belief that the 2020 presidential election was <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/hageman-says-2020-election-was-rigged/article_01a1e786-13f1-11ed-b6fc-d32f25c31359.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rigged against him</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/liz-cheney-lisa-murkowski-lose-election-deniers-fivethirtyeight-88404332</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">One other notable pro-Trump candidate, state Sen. Anthony Bouchard, remains in the race, but he has received some negative headlines: As an 18-year-old, he <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/us-house-candidate-bouchard-says-he-impregnated-14-year-old-when-he-was-18/article_c3996062-e6ad-5027-96a9-1bcd0f832eda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impregnated a 14-year-old girl</a> who later died by suicide; Bouchard has referred to the relationship “like the Romeo and Juliet story.” His support has dwindled from <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CfG_WYStatewide_PollingMemo_220526.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 percent</a> in May to <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CFG_WY-AL_JulyBrushfire_MQ_20220711.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 percent</a> in July, per WPA Intelligence/Club for Growth polling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now without any serious opposition in the pro-Trump lane, Hageman has zoomed into the lead, according to <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22056168/wyoming-poll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a>. The <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/the-poll-results-are-in-hageman-holds-commanding-lead-over-cheney/article_1f33dfe0-02f1-11ed-8202-7befc0111031.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent independent poll</a>, conducted for the Casper Star-Tribune by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy, put Hageman at 52 percent and Cheney at 30 percent. While polls of House races are subject to a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fair bit of error</a>, and polls of primaries even more so, it would require a monumental polling error for Cheney to pull this one out. Even Cheney herself appears to realize it: She recently released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Nq9SpGzic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defiant TV ad</a> featuring her father excoriating Trump — pretty much the opposite of an effective message in this heavily pro-Trump state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s gotten far less attention, but the Republican primary for <strong>secretary of state</strong> will also represent an important step for Wyoming either toward or away from Trump-style illiberalism. Incumbent Ed Buchanan, who has <a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/laramieboomerang/news/buchanan-my-pillow-ceos-claims-of-wyo-election-fraud-false/article_fb4e5e71-db08-5d6b-b480-62bcfa285e74.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended the integrity</a> of the 2020 election in Wyoming, is retiring, and two of the three candidates to replace him believe, despite the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence</a>, that the <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/dockstader-drops-out-of-secretary-of-state-race-endorses-nethercott/article_dfb939d2-fd87-11ec-ba5e-43337b26b863.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was fraudulent</a>. The stronger of these two candidates appears to be state Rep. Chuck Gray (who was running against Cheney before switching to this race). Gray has <a href="https://www.wyomingnewsnow.tv/2022/08/06/former-president-donald-trump-endorses-chuck-gray-wyoming-secretary-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a> and has also raised the most money (<a href="https://wyofile.com/secretary-of-state-hopefuls-vary-on-compliance-with-desired-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$528,000</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is also one prominent candidate, state Sen. Tara Nethercott, who believes the 2020 election in Wyoming was <a href="https://wyofile.com/election-integrity-front-and-center-in-secretary-of-state-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fair and secure</a>. She has the backing of much of the local GOP establishment, including the president of the state Senate and speaker of the state House. She has also raised a respectable amount: roughly $333,000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No Democrat filed to run, so whoever wins the GOP primary is guaranteed to win in November and oversee the 2024 presidential election in the state. Because Wyoming has no lieutenant governor, the secretary of state is also first in line for the governorship should it become vacant.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, U.S. House (both the regular primary and special general election), governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>Midnight Eastern in most of the state, 1 a.m. Eastern in the Aleutian Islands</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other Trump nemesis on the ballot this week is Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Unlike Cheney, though, the moderate Murkowski has frustrated conservative Republicans for years: She <a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/02/collins-murkowski-introduce-alternative-senate-bill-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports abortion rights</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-skinny-repeal-option-health-care/story?id=48870581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act</a> and has voted with Biden <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/lisa-murkowski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">69 percent of the time</a>, including to <a href="https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-to-support-confirmation-of_judge-ketanji-brown-jackson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm now-Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson</a>. And, of course, she was one of the few Republican senators to vote to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/2021/02/15/967878039/7-gop-senators-voted-to-convict-trump-only-1-faces-voters-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convict Trump</a> for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 riot in early 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In retaliation, Trump has <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/06/18/trump-gives-complete-and-total-endorsement-to-tshibaka-in-alaska-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> former Alaska Department of Administration Commissioner Kelly Tshibaka to replace Murkowski in the <strong>Senate</strong>. But unlike Cheney, there is almost no chance that Murkowski loses on Tuesday. That’s not because Murkowski’s anti-Trumpism is popular in Alaska, though; rather, it’s because of the new primary system that Alaska is adopting this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under the terms of a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_and_Campaign_Finance_Laws_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ballot measure</a> passed in 2020, all candidates for office in Alaska now run on the same primary ballot, regardless of party (similar to the systems used by California, Louisiana and Washington). But unlike those states, which use “top-two” primaries, in Alaska the top <em>four</em> candidates advance to the general election, which will be conducted using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maine-is-trying-out-a-new-way-to-run-elections-but-will-it-survive-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under the old, traditional primary system, it would have been easy to imagine Tshibaka defeating Murkowski for the Republican nomination; just look at what’s probably going to happen to Cheney! But under the new system, Murkowski can finish second (or third, or even fourth) to Tshibaka and still advance to the general election.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1241813087-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1241813087-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1241813087-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1241813087-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Trump-backed Kelly Tshibaka’s primary challenge to Sen. Lisa Murkowski is likely to be one of the biggest tests of the former president’s endorsement power. <p>Patrick T. Fallon / AFP / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">With her <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/stw221frq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal name recognition</a> in the state and massive war chest (she’s raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S4AK00099/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9.5 million</a> for the cycle), Murkowski is virtually guaranteed to clear that low bar. Same with Tshibaka, who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AK00127/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.3 million</a> and, of course, has that Trump endorsement. After that, though, it’s uncertain who will snag the last two spots on the November ballot, as no other active candidate has raised more than $50,000. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, honestly, it probably doesn’t matter. The third- and fourth-place finishers will very likely be the first to be eliminated in the ranked-choice general election; one way or another, this race will come down to Murkowski versus Tshibaka in the end. But among a general-election electorate that includes not just Republicans but also Democrats and independents, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/murkowski-alaska-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that is actually a fair fight</a> — and the exact primary results will be our best measure of its competitiveness to date. (Polling in Alaska is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-polling-in-alaska-is-making-us-sweat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notoriously inaccurate</a>.) Even though there’s not much suspense about <em>whether</em> Murkowski and Tshibaka make the general election, who finishes first (and by how much) could tell us who is favored in the fall.</p>

After the death of former Rep. Don Young earlier this year, the Last Frontier is holding a special election on Tuesday to fill his seat in the <strong>House</strong> — and the winner could be anyone from a Democrat to a pro-business Republican to the original tea partier, former Gov. Sarah Palin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-special-election-in-alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June primary</a>, Palin finished first with 27 percent of the vote, followed by Republican businessman Nick Begich III with 19 percent, independent Al Gross with 13 percent and Democratic former state Rep. Mary Peltola with 10 percent. However, Gross — who was Democrats’ U.S. Senate nominee in Alaska in 2020 — quickly <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/06/20/al-gross-withdraws-from-alaskas-us-house-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrew from the race</a> and effectively threw his support behind Peltola. Now, a <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833466571448322?s=20&amp;t=Mdl_loHWQsW95XpZR61BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late-July poll</a> from Alaska Survey Research shows Peltola in first place (with 41 percent), with Begich (30 percent) and Palin (29 percent) battling it out for second.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But remember — general elections in Alaska now use ranked-choice voting, so who finishes second matters a great deal. (This is why, in the waning days of the campaign, Begich and Palin have been <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/08/11/why-republicans-in-alaskas-first-ranked-choice-election-reserve-their-venom-for-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacking each other</a> while Peltola has sailed above the fray.) The third-place finisher will be eliminated and their votes redistributed to whomever their voters ranked second. And that could affect who wins. If Palin finishes third, we’d expect virtually all of her votes to go to Begich, her fellow Republican. Indeed, in this scenario, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833483625545728?s=20&amp;t=Mdl_loHWQsW95XpZR61BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a>, Begich would win 55 percent to 45 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if Begich finishes third, a fair number of his voters might flock to Peltola. Despite having <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/04/04/trump-endorses-palin-in-bid-for-alaskas-sole-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>, Palin remains an unpopular figure in Alaska after her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/us/06palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tumultuous governorship</a>, even among Republicans (64 percent of likely voters in the <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833494220304384?s=20&amp;t=Mdl_loHWQsW95XpZR61BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> had a negative opinion of her). That could be enough to do something that hasn’t happened in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1REYGxQTXblXMHmWuyRiYbbaRlhezrFmMfyNJQwGioYU/edit#gid=711118416" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 years</a>: elect a Democrat in Alaska. According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833489212346368?s=20&amp;t=Mdl_loHWQsW95XpZR61BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a>, Peltola would edge out Palin 51 percent to 49 percent in a head-to-head.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If that happens, it would be interpreted as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-republican-primaries-and-a-special-election-to-watch-in-minnesota-and-wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yet another special election</a> showing that the political wind is at Democrats’ backs in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade (even though, in this case, it would probably also have to do with luck and candidate quality). It would also be a <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/08/08/for-two-candidates-alaskas-us-house-race-is-an-opportunity-to-make-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic moment for Alaska</a>, as Peltola would be the first Alaska Native elected to Congress. But alas, we will have to wait a bit longer to find out whether that “if” becomes reality. In the special election, overseas absentee ballots aren’t due until Aug. 31 (as long as they are postmarked by Aug. 16), and the ranked-choice tabulations can take place only once every ballot has been received and processed. Therefore, we won’t know the winner until then. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, Alaskans will vote in the regularly scheduled primary for the House as well (the special election will determine who serves for the rest of 2022, while the regular election will determine who serves in 2023-24). However, this should be pretty uneventful: Given the fact that they already prevailed over a similar-looking field earlier this year, Palin, Begich and Peltola should all easily make the November ballot. And with Gross no longer in the running, the fourth slot in the regular general election will probably fall to former Assistant Secretary of the Interior Tara Sweeney, a <a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/qa-with-2022-alaska-u-s-house-candidate-tara-sweeney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate Republican</a> who finished fifth in the special primary election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the results of the primary for <strong>governor</strong> will give us some clarity about just how competitive this race will be in the fall. No incumbent Alaska governor has won reelection since 1998, and early in his term, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy looked like he might succumb to the same fate: Opponents mounted what looked like a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/governor-recall-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious recall campaign</a> against him after he made <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2019/06/28/heres-a-partial-list-of-the-dunleavy-line-item-vetoes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive cuts to the state budget</a>. However, the pandemic <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-alaska-d60018aa574e2be0048fd5f00eaa238c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-circuited</a> their effort to collect signatures, and as of this spring, Dunleavy’s net approval rating had rebounded to +20 percentage points (<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/07/19/democratic-governors-are-resisting-bidens-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent approval, 32 percent disapproval</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Dunleavy has attracted some noteworthy opponents in his regularly scheduled reelection bid, including independent former Gov. Bill Walker and Democratic former state Rep. Les Gara. Despite having <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/12/31/dunleavy-accepts-conditional-trump-endorsement-tells-former-president-he-will-not-back-murkowski-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>, Dunleavy is also facing challenges on his right from fellow Republicans state Rep. <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2021/11/29/wasilla-rep-christopher-kurka-announces-run-for-alaska-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Kurka</a> and Kenai Peninsula Borough Mayor <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/01/21/reports-kenai-borough-mayor-pierce-to-run-for-governor-posing-new-gop-challenge-to-dunleavy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Pierce</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Dunleavy, Walker and Gara have <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/07/20/dunleavy-leads-early-fundraising-for-alaska-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominated the fundraising circuit</a>, so they seem like they’re in good shape to advance to November. The questions are whether Kurka or Pierce (or one of the race’s five other candidates) will join them and how high Dunleavy’s vote share will be. If he approaches 50 percent in the primary, that’s a good sign that he’ll be able to build the support he needs to win the general election. But if Walker and/or Gara are close behind him, one of them could overtake him in the ranked-choice tabulations.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">We’ll once again be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live-blogging</a> these results, but the schedule will be a little bifurcated. We’ll begin at 9 p.m. Eastern to cover Wyoming and will continue until the House primary is called. Then, because of the time difference, we’ll pick up the live blog early on <em>Wednesday</em> morning to bring you the Alaska results. No rest for the election-obsessed!</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, we took pains to emphasize that, although he was a significant underdog in our forecast, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/im-here-to-remind-you-that-trump-can-still-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then-President Donald Trump could absolutely win reelection</a>. Frankly, I’m not sure we’ve taken the same care this year when it comes to Democrats and the U.S. House. Their chances to hold the House started out in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-in-2020 vicinity</a> when we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched our forecast</a> — 13 percent — and now they’ve <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risen to 20 percent</a> amidst an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improving political environment for Democrats</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-house-change-711-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-house-change-711-2.png"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s still not terribly likely Democrats win control of the House. But it also means that a GOP takeover is far from a foregone conclusion. So, let’s talk about that 20 percent chance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats started out with 222 House seats following the 2020 election, four more than the number required for a majority. According to our model, there’s a 7 percent chance that Democrats wind up with fewer than 222 seats after November but still enough seats to maintain a narrow majority. Meanwhile, there’s a 13 percent chance that they actually gain seats.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or again finish with 222 exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> Those numbers combined give them their 20 percent chances.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Time for a quick historical gut check. In <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/seats-congress-gainedlost-the-presidents-party-mid-term-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 midterm elections since World War II</a>, the president’s party lost fewer than five seats in the House once, in 1962. And they gained seats twice, in 1998 and 2002. That means three out of 19 times the president’s party would have a successful enough midterm to keep the House, or 16 percent of the time. That squares pretty well with our model’s 20 percent estimate. Of course, the closer we get to the election, the more we can rely on data specific to this year — but it’s good that we’re somewhere in the ballpark.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what about the exceptions when the president’s party had a good midterm? Did they have anything in common and moreover, is there anything they can tell us about this midterm cycle? Let’s take them one by one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats’ strong performance in the 1962 midterms under President John F. Kennedy — they lost only four House seats and gained three Senate seats — is often <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/frc2010093001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attributed to the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis</a>, which happened in late October 1962. The Cuban missile crisis might be overlooked by Americans who came of age after the Cold War, but Kennedy himself thought there was about a <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2017-12/features/risk-%E2%80%98blundering%E2%80%99-into-nuclear-war-lessons-cuban-missile-crisis#:~:text=Kennedy%2C%20after%20it%20was%20over,is%20the%20end%20of%20civilization." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 3 chance that it would end in a nuclear war</a>, so its resolution was one of the more pivotal moments of the 20th century.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are reasonably clear parallels between 1962 and 2002, when there was a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge rally-around-the-flag effect</a> following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and President George W. Bush’s Republicans actually increased their House majority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 1998 midterm, however, wasn’t precipitated by a threat to American security. Instead, there were special <em>political</em> circumstances: The House <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/president-clinton-impeached" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched an impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton in October 1998</a> in what would later become the first impeachment trial against a president since 1868.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial itself wouldn’t begin until after the midterms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if we go back to the last three midterm elections before the end of WWII, the last time the president’s party gained seats in the House was in 1934, in what <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/concise-history-of-the-new-deal/new-deal-at-high-tide-19341936/1FFC2FF1ACAD5E86B22CF4C69D5F7E77" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historians interpret as a show of support</a> for President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal program following the Great Depression.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, all these elections featured some sort of special circumstance: the Great Depression, the Cuban missile crisis, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the first impeachment of a president in 130 years. But such a definition is inherently fuzzy as you can potentially retrofit almost any political or news development to constitute a “special circumstance,” in the same way that <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/most-important-election-of-our-lifetimes-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost every election gets called</a> “the most important election of our lifetimes.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take the 2010 midterms, for example. A Democratic president with an ambitious agenda had been elected two years earlier following a global financial crisis. But unlike in 1934, President Barack Obama’s Democrats didn’t gain seats in the House. Instead, they lost 63, the steepest defeat for any party at the midterms since 1938.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Or consider the 1990 midterms. President George H.W. Bush was <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/234971/george-bush-retrospective.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already fairly popular</a>, but there was a further rally-around-the-flag effect following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, sending his approval ratings into the mid-70s before they slipped back into the 50s by November. Still, that might seem to qualify as a special circumstance. Yet, Bush’s Republicans lost seats in the House. Then again, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-2022-be-a-good-year-for-republicans-yes-we-know-its-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they lost fewer seats</a> than usual (eight seats) along with just one Senate seat, so maybe that counts as a partial validation of our theory.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/mandela-barnes-democrats-best-hope-flipping-senate-seat-88399333</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">In any event, if Democrats do keep the House, I don’t think historians will have any trouble giving 2022 the special-circumstances <a href="https://www.deseret.com/1991/9/5/18939671/baseball-drops-the-asterisk-from-maris-record" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asterisk</a>, like they do now for 1998 and 2002. But what is the special circumstance?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It might be noted that the 2022 election is taking place amidst the still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, unquestionably one of the most important events in every American’s lifetime given the widespread death and disruption to daily life. With that said, most people have stopped caring about COVID-19; only <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 percent</a> of Americans regarded it as the most important issue facing the country when Gallup asked about it in June. Perhaps if the delta and omicron variants had never come along, Democrats could have campaigned on some miraculous return to normal. Instead, the return has been bumpy, epidemiologically, economically and otherwise. So that’s not the special circumstance I’m referring to, although the pandemic may have hard-to-measure knock-off effects on politics and society.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nor is the special circumstance an international or security crisis, although there are some conflicts that could boil over by November — that’s part of the intrinsic uncertainty in an election forecast. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine isn’t having any obvious effect on the U.S. midterms for now, but if there were nuclear weapons used or any direct American or NATO military engagement, that could change. Meanwhile, Chinese-U.S. tensions over Taiwan are also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/world/asia/china-taiwan-drills-economy-military.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit</a> there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, I’m keeping my eye on the potential for a special political circumstance, more like what we saw in 1998, when the public responded to increasing Republican partisanship and their efforts to impeach Clinton.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans swept to power in Congress in 1994 on an unusually substantive platform including the “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/01/20/republican-midterm-plan-education-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contract with America</a>,” and even achieved a number of policy successes with the centrist, triangulating Clinton. So for them to turn around and make the 1998 midterms about Clinton’s personal conduct was <a href="https://rollcall.com/2019/09/25/the-contract-with-americas-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably a mistake</a>. Although the Monica Lewinsky scandal seems almost quaint by current standards, the impeachment trial and other investigations into Clinton <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflected a significant escalation of partisanship</a> under then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, one that has continued through today.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, partisanship alone doesn’t guarantee an electoral backlash. Near-universal Republican opposition to Obama’s agenda didn’t hurt them at all in the midterms in 2010. Instead, what differentiated 1998 is that Republicans were on the attack and not merely trying to block Democrats from getting their own agenda implemented. Relative to the standards of 1998, impeachment was a dramatic step and one that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/03/clintons-impeachment-barely-dented-his-public-support-and-it-turned-off-many-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed Clinton to gain significant public sympathy</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-win-ohio-wisconsin-fivethirtyeight-88400821</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">This time, Republicans are exercising power not through the Congress but through the courts: most importantly, through the decision by a 6-3 majority of Republican-appointed judges on the Supreme Court to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn Roe v. Wade</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Immediately after the court overturned Roe, Democrats began to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gain ground on the generic congressional ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they’d support in an election, and it’s now translated into some electoral successes, too. In Kansas last week, voters <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Kansas_No_State_Constitutional_Right_to_Abortion_and_Legislative_Power_to_Regulate_Abortion_Amendment_(August_2022)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly rejected a ballot initiative</a> that would have allowed the legislature to restrict abortion in the state amid <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23290714/kansas-abortion-referendum-primary-turnout-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very high turnout</a>. And in Minnesota this week, Republicans won a special election in the 1st Congressional District by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/09/us/elections/results-minnesota-us-house-district-1-special-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 4 percentage points</a>, a district that Trump won by 10 points in 2020. Likewise, on June 28, just a few days after Roe was overturned, Republicans won a special election in Nebraska’s 1st District by only 5 points in a district that <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/nebraska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump carried by 15 points</a>.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the &lt;a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/election-administration-campaigns/elections-calendar/congressional-district-1-special-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Aug. 9 special election in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District&lt;/a&gt; took place within the district’s “old” boundaries, which Trump won by 10 points in 2020, the &lt;a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/07/06/nebraska-quirk-used-new-map-to-fill-house-vacancy-last-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;special election in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District&lt;/a&gt; took place within the newly redrawn boundaries; if this map were in place in 2020, Trump would have &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2022/congressional-redistricting-maps-by-state-and-district/nebraska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;carried Nebraska’s 1st District by 11 points&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, you can make excuses for Republicans on a case-by-case basis — the Kansas ballot measure was confusingly worded, Nebraska’s former Republican representative <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/notes-on-the-state-of-the-primaries-june-29-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been mired in scandal</a> and that Minnesota district has historically been bluer in races for Congress than the presidency. I’d be conservative in putting too much stock in these since it’s a small sample size, too. But at the very least, these are hardly the sorts of results you’d associate with a “red wave,” and they suggest that something different <em>might</em> be going on.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just the courts, either. Republicans are also aggressively exercising power through state governments, especially on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/us/indiana-abortion-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/25/lgbtq-rights-gop-bills-dont-say-gay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gay and transgender rights</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-anti-critical-race-theory-bills-are-taking-aim-at-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education policy</a>. And although voters don’t regard Jan. 6 as an event as important as Sept. 11 — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/01/post-poll-january-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public opinion about it is also much more polarized</a> — it’s a reminder that Republicans can also potentially seek to achieve power through extralegal means.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If nothing else, Democratic voters have no shortage of motivation to turn out: Many feel as though their basic rights are being threatened, something a party’s voters ordinarily aren’t concerned about when it controls both the presidency and Congress. The “enthusiasm gap” often accounts for much of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the presidential party’s disadvantage</a> at the midterms, but it’s <a href="https://www.lx.com/politics/democrats-young-voters-have-closed-the-enthusiasm-gap-4-months-before-2022-midterms/55009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not clear it exists this year after Roe was overturned</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All that said, Republicans are still fairly clear favorites to keep the House. Notably, President Biden is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite unpopular</a> despite a modest improvement in his approval ratings, whereas FDR, JFK, Clinton and GWB were all popular at the times of their midterms. The public still has very negative views about the economy and <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the direction the country is headed in</a>, and that’s usually rough for the party in power to overcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the circumstances of these midterms are also potentially unusual, with high uncertainty, and that’s why Democrats keeping the House is a thinkable outcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Aug. 13, 2022, 8:50 a.m.):</strong> This article has been updated with a footnote explaining that if Nebraska’s new redistricting maps had been in place in 2020, Trump would have won Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District by 11 points.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Hawaii hasn’t elected a Republican to federal or statewide office <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/05/republican-djou-wins-hawaii-special-037649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2010</a> and hasn’t had a competitive general election for those offices <a href="https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/government-politics/2014-08-14/takai-vs-djou-shaping-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2014</a>. According to our 2022 midterm election forecast, that won’t change this year either: Democrats have a greater than 99 in 100 chance to win the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate race</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s mansion</a> and both <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/hawaii/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. House</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/hawaii/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seats</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Hawaii has also elected some <em>very</em> different types of politicians during that span of Democratic dominance. The state’s U.S. senators, Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/brian-schatz-progressive-senator-reshapes-2020-campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk</a> and <a href="https://voteview.com/person/20713/mazie-hirono" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote</a> like progressives. But Rep. Ed Case is a <a href="https://bluedogcaucus-murphy.house.gov/members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Dog Democrat</a> who was one of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine moderates</a> to hold up President Biden’s ambitious spending plan last year in favor of passing an infrastructure bill first. And, of course, lest we forget: Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-tulsi-gabbard-could-win-the-2020-democratic-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative positions</a> on <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/a-bold-pro-life-move-for-a-democrat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tulsi-gabbard-legislation-hawaii-gender-identity-markwayne-mullin-fdc7d8b0461a54ee88c1a0c85a0893f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ rights</a> and was one of only three Democrats <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/18/politics/tulsi-gabbard-present-impeachment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to vote not to impeach</a> then-President Donald Trump in 2019.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So the Aloha State is the perfect example of why we do so much primary coverage here at FiveThirtyEight. In one-party-rule states like Hawaii, the party in control tends to be <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2022-04-19/for-hawaii-democrats-the-skys-the-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very ideologically diverse</a>, making primary elections extra important. And Hawaii’s 2022 primary election, taking place on Saturday, should be no exception, as Hawaii Democrats will have the opportunity to decide the ideological direction of two high-profile offices where the incumbent is not running for reelection.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to wat</strong><strong>ch:</strong> 2nd Congressional District, governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close</strong><strong>: </strong>1 a.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, seven Democrats are running to succeed the state’s term-limited <strong>governor</strong>. The clear front-runner is Lt. Gov. Josh Green, an emergency-room doctor whose <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/19/hawaii-covid-success-story-322919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proactive response to the COVID-19 pandemic</a> made him a well-known and popular figure in the state. And according to a <a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2022/07/24/hawaii-news/approvals-still-high-for-green-in-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mid-July poll</a> from Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy for the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, 65 percent of likely Democratic primary voters had a favorable opinion of Green. Green also enjoys the support of some of <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/03/lt-gov-josh-green-is-racking-up-union-endorsements-adding-to-his-momentum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawaii’s largest unions</a>, which is notable because Hawaii is the most heavily unionized state in the nation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Business executive Vicky Cayetano isn’t letting Green off easy, though. The former president of the state’s largest laundry company has <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/vicky-cayetano-turns-to-self-funding-for-her-gubernatorial-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donated $1.5 million to her own campaign</a> and raised almost as much as Green overall (<a href="https://csc.hawaii.gov/Report/RPT2021/20220803111832CC11713DIS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.1 million</a> to his <a href="https://csc.hawaii.gov/Report/RPT2021/20220803175407CC10174DIS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.4 million</a>). Cayetano has <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2021/08/30/former-first-lady-vicky-cayetano-officially-announces-run-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never run for office before</a>, but she is married to former Gov. Ben Cayetano. She also co-chaired the 2020 campaign of Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi, an independent who <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/rick-blangiardi-honolulu-mayor-1234884867/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for Trump in 2016</a>. For her part, Cayetano insists her “values absolutely align with the Democratic Party” but also describes herself as <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/hawaiis-former-first-lady-vicky-161300851.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscally conservative</a>, which aligns her with the pro-business wing of the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The third major candidate, Rep. Kai Kahele, has support from many progressive state legislators. He has <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/05/congressman-kai-kahele-joins-the-race-for-hawaii-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decried the influence of money in politics</a>, saying he would not accept donations above $100 and would rely on public financing for his campaign. However, Kahele bafflingly <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/kai-kahele-wont-be-able-to-get-public-funding-for-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to file the paperwork</a> necessary to qualify for public financing, and as a result, he is strapped for cash, raising only <a href="https://csc.hawaii.gov/Report/RPT2021/20220803231634CC11209DIS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$179,000</a> for the cycle. In fairness, he did jump into the race late — just three months ago — but Kahele’s actions haven’t done anything to tamp down the criticism that his heart just isn’t in politics. In April, <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/04/has-us-rep-kai-kahele-given-up-on-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honolulu Civil Beat reported</a> that Kahele had not attended a vote at the U.S. Capitol in person since January and was still working part-time as a pilot for Hawaiian Airlines. (Though this <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/kai-kahele-proxy-voting-hawaiian-airlines-pilor/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially raised questions</a> of whether Kahele was violating House ethics rules by accepting outside income, he has said that his earnings from the airline fell within the legal limits.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22080134/civil-beat-july-2022-democratic-governor-primary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://314action.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hawaii-Memo-Feb-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> of the race show Green with a double-digit lead over both Cayetano and Kahele. The July Mason-Dixon survey, for example, gave Green 55 percent support, Cayetano 19 percent and Kahele 16 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kahele’s gubernatorial campaign has also opened up his <strong>2nd Congressional District</strong> for the taking. Six Democrats are in the running, but the primary will probably come down to just two: former state Sen. Jill Tokuda and state Rep. Patrick Branco.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tokuda is a <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/hawaiis-congressional-district-2-race-veteran-tokuda-vs-newcomer-branco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veteran of Hawaii politics</a>, having served 12 years in the state legislature and running twice for lieutenant governor. She’s also a close ally of Hirono and the progressive wing of the party; for example, the <a href="https://weareprogressives.org/congressional-progressive-caucus-pac-endorses-jill-tokuda-in-hi-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC</a> has endorsed her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Branco has served only one term in the state House and presents himself as a fresh face. He has also tried to turn his diversity into an asset: He would be Hawaii’s first openly gay member of Congress, first Hispanic member of Congress and, with Kahele’s departure, only Native Hawaiian member of Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tokuda has long been considered the front-runner in the race, however. She has outraised Branco <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/HI/02/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$528,000 to $153,000</a>, and a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22082138/july-2022-democratic-congressional-primaries.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late-June poll</a> from Honolulu Civil Beat and Hawaii News Now gave her a 31-percent-to-6-percent lead (albeit with 63 percent of likely voters undecided). However, a <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/08/can-patrick-brancos-mainland-backers-buy-him-a-seat-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cadre of outside groups</a> — from the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to the <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/crypto-super-pac-launches-ad-campaign-in-support-of-patrick-branco-n-cd2-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-cryptocurrency super PAC</a> Web3 Forward and veterans group VoteVets — have spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=HI02&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> supporting Branco or attacking Tokuda. <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/chad-blair-mud-slinging-in-hawaiis-primary-is-getting-ugly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One particularly controversial ad</a> referenced the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and then pointed out that the National Rifle Association had endorsed Tokuda in a previous campaign. Without any more recent polls, we don’t know how much these ads have moved the needle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Across Hawaii, vote centers close and ballots are due at 1 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, so we won’t be covering the results live (that’s prime clubbing time!). Don’t worry, though — we’ll be back at the live-blogging routine for Tuesday’s primaries in Alaska and Wyoming.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/past-cases-reveal-trumps-legal-exposure-fbi-raid/story?id=88190464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago</a>, former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate, with a warrant to reportedly investigate whether he had mishandled or kept classified documents in violation of the Presidential Records Act, which requires presidents to turn over any written materials related to their official duties.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The dust is still settling on what exactly will come of the search — such as, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-believes-trump-held-sensitive-classified-documents-associates/story?id=88276442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what type of classified information</a> does the FBI suspect Trump to be in possession of? But <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/09/48734/3?utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SM-2022-08-US-B2C-DQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling from YouGov</a> conducted on Aug. 9 found that 62 percent of Americans thought it was either “a very big problem” (45 percent) or “somewhat of a problem” (17 percent) that Trump allegedly held onto classified documents after leaving office. That said, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/public-opinion-of-the-mueller-investigation-has-become-more-partisan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve seen with previous investigations of Trump</a>, public opinion is split starkly along partisan lines, and Americans generally <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/half-of-americans-think-impeachment-is-a-bad-use-of-congresss-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remain leery of taking action against him</a>. That same Aug. 9 YouGov poll, for instance, found that 76 percent of Democrats — and 44 percent of independents — said they’d consider it a very big problem, compared with just 12 percent of Republicans. And <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/11/fbi-raid-increases-trumps-2024-primary-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Aug. 10 poll from Politico/Morning Consult corroborates this breakdown</a>: 81 percent of Democratic registered voters said the search was based on evidence that Trump had committed a crime, while only 16 percent of Republicans agreed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We don’t have any other nonpartisan polls yet,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> but these findings are in line with polls that followed two similar stories from earlier this year. First, in February, news broke that the National Archives and Records Administration had <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/national-archives-retrieves-boxes-presidential-records-mar-lago/story?id=82729844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retrieved 15 boxes of documents</a> from Mar-a-Lago that they said Trump shouldn’t have had in his possession, and then New York Times reporter <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/02/10/maggie-haberman-book-trump-papers?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-maggiehaberman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie Haberman released bombshell details from her upcoming book</a> of the former president clogging a White House toilet with papers he’d tried to flush. <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/national/2022/02_28_2022_complete_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=AEF0D74480E38EB7EF6A0858D7E0529C526027CF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Feb. 16-20 poll from Suffolk University/USA Today</a>, for instance, found that 56 percent of registered voters thought the National Archives retrieving such documents from Trump was a serious matter warranting investigation. But again, there were stark differences by party, with 88 percent of Democrats saying it should be investigated, compared with just 27 percent of Republicans. Still, a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/mfe5ie0pbd/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey conducted Feb. 12-15 by The Economist/YouGov</a> found that 79 percent of Americans thought Trump taking home classified material was more “wrong” than “right” — including 61 percent of Republicans and 91 percent of Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This poll from The Economist/YouGov went one step further, though, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/02/17/most-americans-say-trump-taking-classified-materia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparing Trump’s security violation</a> to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-hillary-clintons-email-saga/story?id=29442707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email system to conduct government business</a> as secretary of state. And what it found is that a similar share of Americans considered both Trump’s and Clinton’s actions very or somewhat serious. For example, 47 percent said Trump’s security violation was “very serious,” compared with 43 percent who said the same of Clinton’s issue. Notably, however, there were stark partisan splits on these questions, with 93 percent of Democrats and 48 percent of Republicans saying Trump’s actions were at least somewhat serious versus 91 percent of Republicans and 56 percent of Democrats who said the same about Clinton’s actions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It remains to be seen what legal action, if any, may come from this week’s FBI search, but public opinion on prior investigations of Trump offers some clues as to how Americans may be feeling about it. Consider special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Following the public release of the Mueller report in April 2019, polls found <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/both-parties-think-the-mueller-report-was-fair-they-just-disagree-on-what-it-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans unable to agree</a> on the investigation’s findings: A Washington Post/ABC News poll fielded at the time found that 81 percent of Democrats said they believed Trump interfered in Mueller’s investigation to the level of obstruction of justice, while 77 percent of Republicans said the opposite. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, Americans have been hesitant to take action against Trump even if they think he did something wrong. For instance, the same Washington Post/ABC News poll found that shortly after the Mueller report was published, 56 percent of Americans said Congress should <em>not</em> start impeachment proceedings, which was 10 percentage points higher than what the poll found a few months earlier, in August 2018. It was a similar story regarding Trump’s first impeachment trial. In January 2020, after the House voted to impeach Trump but before the Senate voted to acquit, about half of Americans (51 percent) said they considered <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/half-of-americans-think-impeachment-is-a-bad-use-of-congresss-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impeachment a wasteful use of Congress’s time</a>, according to a FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll. That said, there are exceptions that show more stringent public stances on holding Trump accountable: A recent <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-the-january-6th-hearings-july-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll</a> reported that 50 percent of Americans thought Trump should be criminally charged based on evidence shown in the congressional hearings on the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, the FBI’s search of Trump’s estate is just the latest in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/politics/list-investigations-trump/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a long list of legal problems</a> facing Trump. In fact, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-expected-testify-wednesday-york-ag-probe/story?id=88162139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not even the only development in his legal issues this week</a>. The question now is whether things will be different in the eyes of the public this time around. But if previous investigations are any indication, it doesn’t look likely. </p>



<h2>Other polling b<strong>ites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Among Americans with social media, over half (54 percent) said their posts don’t accurately reflect their daily life, <a href="https://civicscience.com/how-real-is-bereal-and-social-media/">per a survey from CivicScience conducted July 12-19</a>. And of adults who said they’ve spent four or more hours on social media a day, 66 percent said they felt “very” or “somewhat strongly” stressed in the last week. Those who spent the least time on social media — less than an hour a day — also reported stress but at a slightly lower rate: 51 percent.</li><li>Related to the above, 57 percent of Americans said they wanted to “spend a few days ‘off the grid’ without the expectation of responding to any calls, texts, or online messages,” <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/05/d09cd/2">according to YouGov polling on Aug. 5</a>. This was especially true of adults between ages 30 to 44 (61 percent) and 45 to 64 (63 percent), while it was least true among those under the age of 30 (48 percent).</li><li>Of Americans who’ve been employed, 81 percent said they had quit a job at least once in their life, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/08/09/who-quits-their-jobs-and-why-poll">per a YouGov survey conducted July 27-29</a>. This differed across income levels, though, with those in higher income brackets more likely to have called it quits at some point. Ninety percent of those with a family income over $100,000 said they had quit a job, compared with 83 percent among those with a family income of $50,000-100,000 and 76 percent among those with a family income of less than $50,000.</li><li><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-are-disillusioned-over-climate-change/">Another scoop</a> on sweet treats: Crunch Ice Cream Bars were Americans’ favorite treat from ice cream trucks, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/entertainment/articles-reports/2022/08/08/americans-favorite-sweet-treats-ice-cream-truck">according to July 28-31 polling from YouGov</a>. The survey ranked items by “win percentage,” or how often one treat won against another in a one-on-one matchup. However, the Crunch Ice Cream Bar’s popularity wasn’t overwhelming, coming in at 64.2 percent. It barely edged out the competition, which included Drumsticks (64.1 percent), vanilla ice cream sandwiches (64.1 percent), twist soft-serve cones (62.4 percent) and Klondike bars (60.1 percent). For those of you wondering, the <a href="https://abc7news.com/choco-taco-discontinued-klondike-ice-cream-where-to-buy/12108998/">likely</a> soon-to-be <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/klondike-discontinues-choco-taco-87428650">discontinued Choco Taco</a> came in 11th, with 55.2 percent. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p>What If Democrats — Or Republicans — Had Won Every Redistricting Battle?</p>
<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/ryan-best/">Ryan Best</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/">Nathaniel Rakich</a></p>
<p>Get the data on <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/slanted-maps">GitHub</a></p>
<p>With control of Congress at stake for potentially 10 years, the 2021-22 redistricting process was a pitched battle between the two parties. Both sides fought hard to install maps favorable to them, but in the end, their efforts largely came out in the wash. The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/">new national congressional map that emerged</a> largely preserved the (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/">Republican-leaning</a>) balance of power that existed at the end of last decade.</p>
<p>But what if it had turned out differently? What if Democrats or Republicans — or even nonpartisan reformers — had won every redistricting battle this cycle? How different would the national congressional map look?</p>
<p>We don’t have to imagine. Thanks to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/">FiveThirtyEight redistricting tracker</a>, we have a record of 365 potential congressional maps that were officially proposed this past year. And we can use the best Democratic, best Republican and most competitive proposal from every state to picture what each side’s best-case scenario was this redistricting cycle.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn’t what the national map for the House of Representatives would look like if one party had had free rein to gerrymander in every state. (We <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/#GOP">already did</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/#Dem">that project</a>.) Instead, these are the best maps for each side that <i>theoretically</i> could have resulted from the redistricting process as it actually played out.1 Curious what these alternative political universes would look like? Use the interactive below to toggle between them:</p>
<p>CHOOSE MAPS THAT WERE:</p>
<p>ApprovedMost competitiveBest for DemocratsBest for RepublicansPARTISAN LEAN OF DISTRICTS:</p>
<p>Solid D≥D+15</p>
<p>Highly Competitive</p>
<p>Solid R≥R+15</p>
<p>Competitive D≥D+5</p>
<p>Competitive R≥R+5</p>
<p>MAJORITYThere are 208 Republican-leaning seats, 187 Democratic-leaning seats and 40 highly competitive seats in the approved maps.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that a Democratic proposal would never realistically pass a Republican-controlled legislature, or vice versa. But looking at actual maps that were proposed does reveal some fundamental truths about redistricting and each side’s constraints this cycle. For example, on Earth 2, where Democrats got everything they wanted, the party was still held back by the fact that they didn’t control the redistricting process in enough states. Meanwhile, on Earth 3, Republicans drew themselves some cutthroat gerrymanders — but bizarrely, it wound up resulting in more safely <i>Democratic</i> districts too. Let’s take a trip into the multiverse, shall we?</p>
<p>WHAT IF DEMOCRATS HAD PASSED THEIR BEST MAPS?MAJORITYThere are 185 Republican-leaning seats, 215 Democratic-leaning seats and 35 highly competitive seats in the most favorable maps for Democrats.</p>
<p>A blue seat for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/utah/purple_3_3/">Salt Lake City</a> and the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/wisconsin/commission_plan_b/">Milwaukee suburbs</a>? No Republican-leaning seats in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/draft_concept_3/">Maryland</a>? A <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/">second majority-Black seat</a> in both <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_c/">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb4/">Louisiana</a>? Swing seats in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arkansas/hb1962/">Arkansas</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/montana/proposal_08/">Montana</a>? The preservation of their <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorks-proposed-congressional-map-is-heavily-biased-toward-democrats-will-it-pass/">aggressive gerrymander</a> in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/amended_democratic_proposal/">New York</a>? Welcome to Democrats’ dream scenario for 2021-22 redistricting.</p>
<p>If the best proposal for Democrats had been enacted in every state, the country would have wound up with 28 more Democratic-leaning seats and 23 fewer Republican-leaning seats than the current, real map.2</p>
<p>Still, even in this best-case scenario for Democrats, that wouldn’t have been an <i>overwhelming</i> number of Democratic-leaning seats. The country’s median congressional seat still would have been highly competitive, with a partisan lean of D+4. By contrast, consider that the median congressional seat here in the real world (North Carolina’s 13th District) has a partisan lean of R+3. In other words, even in their best-case scenario, Democrats could have put themselves in an only slightly better position than Republicans find themselves in right now.</p>
<p>This reflects just how <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/">behind the eightball</a> Democrats were in the redistricting process from the very start. For example, Democrats were totally shut out of the redistricting process in Texas, so the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/draft_plan_1/">map most “favorable” to them</a> was drawn by Republicans and is heavily biased toward the GOP. Redistricting commissions, meanwhile, helped several states <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/did-redistricting-commissions-live-up-to-their-promise/">draw more <i>democratic</i> maps this cycle</a>, but prevented many of those same states from drawing more <i>Democratic</i> maps. And because these commissions disproportionately exist in states where Democrats enjoyed full control of state government, Democrats were limited from drawing maximalist gerrymanders in states like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/commission_approved/">California</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/preliminary/">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/virginia/commission_plan_b5/">Virginia</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/washington/house_democratic_caucus/">Washington</a>. Instead, these maps were all relatively fair maps drawn by commissions.</p>
<p>WHAT IF REPUBLICANS HAD PASSED THEIR BEST MAPS?MAJORITYThere are 227 Republican-leaning seats, 174 Democratic-leaning seats and 34 highly competitive seats in the most favorable maps for Republicans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, imagine a world where the state supreme courts of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/cst_2/">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/senate_gop_proposal/">Ohio</a> had let Republicans enact their most egregious gerrymanders, or where the redistricting commissions in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/first_proposal/">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/names_plan/">New York</a> had passed some of their early, Republican-favorable drafts. In this best-case scenario for the GOP, we’d be looking at 227 red seats nationwide and only 174 blue seats.</p>
<p>This is <i>so</i> much better for Republicans than the Democrats’ dream scenario is for Democrats (a map with 215 blue seats and 185 red seats). What’s more, the median congressional seat on the GOP map would have a partisan lean of R+7 — enough to put control of the House mostly out of reach for Democrats. Again, this asymmetry reflects that, between political geography and having control of more map-drawing entities, conditions were simply better for Republicans this redistricting cycle.</p>
<p>But paradoxically, there’s one way in which the Republican dream map is good for Democrats: It creates two <i>more</i> solidly blue seats3 than the Democratic dream map does (149 versus 147). That may seem counterintuitive, but it illustrates the tried-and-true gerrymandering technique of “packing” — i.e., packing as many of your opponent’s voters as possible into the smallest number of districts. For example, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/voters_of_commonwealth/">most pro-Republican map</a> of Pennsylvania created five solidly Democratic districts in order to make the other 12 winnable for Republicans.</p>
<p>The other striking thing about the Republican best-case-scenario map is how it’s only a few good Republican maps away from the national map we actually got. It has only 19 more Republican-leaning seats and 13 fewer Democratic-leaning seats than the real map, reflecting how a lot of things went right for Republicans in redistricting this year (even if it could have gone even better). For instance, the party’s best maps in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/house_passed/">Texas</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/P000C0094/">Florida</a> (two of the three states with the most congressional districts) were very close to the ones that eventually passed.</p>
<p>WHAT IF THE MOST COMPETITIVE MAPS HAD PASSED?MAJORITYThere are 186 Republican-leaning seats, 181 Democratic-leaning seats and 68 highly competitive seats in the most competitive maps.</p>
<p>Both the Democratic and Republican dream maps — and, for that matter, the maps that actually were enacted — sacrifice the number of highly competitive seats. But on Earth 4, those of us who enjoy competitive elections can truly be happy. Not only does this map boost the number of competitive seats by 28, but it also creates an almost perfectly balanced national House map — one where Republicans have a negligible five-seat advantage.</p>
<p>In contrast to the real world, where the lack of competitive districts means we should expect only narrow House majorities for the foreseeable future, this super-competitive map could produce some drastic swings in the party composition of Congress. If Democrats won every highly competitive district in this map, they’d emerge with a 249-186 House majority; if Republicans did, they’d sit at 254-181. That’s a bigger majority than either party has held in the House since the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Party-Divisions/Party-Divisions/">huge Democratic majority</a> that followed the 2008 election.</p>
<p>But those 68 highly competitive seats still wouldn’t be nearly as many as the House had as recently as the 2000 election, when there were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/">102 such districts</a>. Again, that reflects cold, hard political reality: Competitive districts are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-swing-districts-dwindle-can-a-divided-house-stand/">on the decline</a> in this country — and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ending-gerrymandering-wont-fix-what-ails-america/">not just because of gerrymandering</a>.</p>
<p>True, in states like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/georgia/dem_proposal/">Georgia</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/house_passed/">Texas</a>, the politicians who drew every proposed map this cycle had no incentive to encourage competitive seats — but even in states where nonpartisan entities like commissions and courts drew some proposals, the most pro-competition map still has a surprisingly small number of highly competitive seats. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/minnesota/wattson/">Minnesota’s</a> most competitive map had only one, for instance. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/virginia/commission_plan_c1_b/">Virginia’s</a> had only two. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/commission_draft_plan/">California’s</a> had six, but that’s only 12 percent of the state’s 52 districts.</p>
<p>Simply put, political polarization has made it harder to draw competitive seats. There are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12218">fewer swing voters</a> than there used to be, and the political realignment along <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/">urban-rural lines</a> means most parts of the country are either solidly red or solidly blue. And there is no alternative universe where that isn’t true.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This is the second entry in a </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-its-like-to-open-an-abortion-clinic-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>series</em></a><em> tracking what it’s like to open an all-trimester abortion clinic in the U.S. as abortion rights are being curtailed.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Morgan Nuzzo thinks a lot about how someone might kill her. She talked about it calmly, almost offhandedly, as she and I walked through the abortion clinic she’s opening in September with her business partner, Dr. Diane Horvath. “That’s where the steel security door will go,” Nuzzo said, pointing to an open doorway. We walked through exam rooms and offices. We talked about bulletproof glass and panic buttons. We passed a couple of ordinary-looking windows and she sighed. “I don’t know what we’re going to do about those,” she said. “We can’t put bars over them or people will feel like they’re in jail. But someone might try to come through them.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are the things abortion providers like Nuzzo think about, especially now. People who perform abortions are routinely harassed and threatened, as are clinic workers, patients and the friends and family members who take them to their appointments. According to the National Abortion Federation, an advocacy group for abortion providers, <a href="https://5aa1b2xfmfh2e2mk03kk8rsx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021_NAF_VD_Stats_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 people connected to abortion clinics have been murdered</a> in the U.S. since 1973, when abortion became legal nationwide. In addition, 26 attempted murders have been reported through 2021.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NAF began collecting data on violent or disruptive incidents at member clinics and affiliated organizations in the U.S. and Canada in 1977. Data from 2013 to 2021 also includes reports from public hospitals and public and private clinics in Mexico City and private clinics in Colombia. The &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/gunn.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first known murder of an abortion provider&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. was in 1993, and to date, all murders reported have happened in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

But anti-abortion extremism is still extensive and sometimes severe. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/recent-cases-violence-against-reproductive-health-care-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bomb threats</a>, death threats, hate mail, vandalism, arson, stalking and assault and battery — abortion clinics and the people who work there are targets for them all. As recently as 2015, a man <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/11/planned-parenthood-shooter-happy-his-attack/32579921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fatally shot three people</a> and wounded nine others at a Colorado Planned Parenthood, saying later that he was “upset with them performing abortions and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/01/28/464594826/in-wake-of-videos-planned-parenthood-investigations-find-no-fetal-tissue-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling of baby parts</a>.” Things could shift in unpredictable ways now that abortion is no longer legal everywhere. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nuzzo and Horvath could be particularly vulnerable to harassment and attacks since their clinic will offer abortions into the third trimester of pregnancy. But abortion providers everywhere are facing new risks. Anti-abortion protesters, emboldened by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recent Supreme Court decision</a> overturning the constitutional right to abortion, could travel to more abortion-friendly states like Maryland, where Nuzzo, a certified nurse-midwife, and Horvath are opening their clinic. For them, every day could bring a new, unknown threat.</p>

Set to open in September, the clinic will offer abortions into the third trimester of pregnancy, which will likely put its security at greater risk. <p>Jeremy Elvas for FiveThirtyEight</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Nuzzo and Horvath’s clinic is in a sprawling complex of offices down the street from one of the University of Maryland campuses. Their space is on the ground floor of a building set on a small hill, which means there are only a few windows facing an interior courtyard. The lack of windows “makes the interior feel a little basement-y, but overall, it’s a big plus,” Nuzzo told me. Unlike clinics in standalone buildings or on city streets, protesters won’t be able to block the entrance without a significant intrusion onto private property. Nuzzo noted with pleasure that the entry to the parking lot is across the street from a frat house. “We might ask them to keep an eye out, let us know if anything looks weird,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Outside abortion clinics, it’s common to see clusters — or sometimes crowds — of anti-abortion activists gathering as close to the clinic as they can legally stand. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/us/clinton-signs-bill-banning-blockades-and-violent-acts-at-abortion-clinics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Under a federal law passed in 1994</a>, the year after an anti-abortion extremist <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/gunn.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot and killed an abortion doctor</a> outside his Florida clinic, penalties for blockading clinics or inflicting violence on the people who work inside can be severe. The law helped reduce some of the violence by making the potential punishments more intense, according to <a href="https://law.ucdavis.edu/people/mary-ziegler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ziegler,</a> a legal historian and professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, but <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/abortion-clinic-threats-violence-safety-post-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prosecutions are still rare</a> — and anti-abortion protesters continue to take the risk. </p>

In March, another group of anti-abortion activists allegedly <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/anti-abortion-activists-invade-SF-clinic-17185369.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed their way</a> into an abortion clinic in San Francisco, chanting, “We know who you are, we know what you do,” and attempted to break into operating rooms. In May, a clinic under construction in Wyoming caught on fire in a suspected arson attack. A few weeks after the Supreme Court’s decision, six anti-abortion protesters <a href="https://www.woodtv.com/news/grand-rapids/6-anti-abortion-protesters-arrested-at-gr-reproductive-health-clinic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were arrested</a> at a clinic in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for blocking the employee door and the entry to the parking lot. And an Indiana OB-GYN who provided a medication abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio in June <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/26/1113577718/indiana-doctor-abortion-ohio-10-year-old" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been aggressively criticized</a> on right-wing media and by Indiana’s Republican attorney general, who called for an investigation of the doctor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Third-trimester abortion providers are particularly at risk, according to <a href="https://bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/carole-joffe-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carole Joffe</a>, a sociologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied threats to abortion providers. In 2009, a third-trimester abortion doctor named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/us/07tiller.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Tiller</a> was murdered at church by an anti-abortion extremist after decades of being targeted with threats and violence, including a separate shooting and the firebombing of his clinic. “He was shot in both arms before the eventual killing,” Joffe said. Tiller had been extensively vilified by conservatives and anti-abortion advocates for years. “Bill O’Reilly referred to him numerous times on Fox News as ‘Tiller the Killer,’” she said. This year, the anniversary of his death happened just about a month before the constitutional right to abortion was overturned. On that day, Horvath texted me, “It’s a reminder that there are not an insignificant number [of] people who want us dead, and who would celebrate our deaths.”</p>

After the fall of Roe v. Wade, many of them are even more uncertain about what will come next. <p>Charlie Riedel / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And confrontations seem likely to increase in the coming months. In fact, they may already be on the upswing for everyone involved in the abortion debate. Crisis pregnancy centers, which try to persuade women not to have abortions, have also been <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/hialeah/article263217043.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vandalized</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/07/01/nashville-molotov-cocktail-abortion-tennessee/7788434001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened</a> recently. And even though the legal landscape is friendlier to anti-abortion advocates than it has been in almost 50 years, some are still frustrated that legal abortion will continue in many states. On its Facebook page, an anti-abortion group called Red Rose Rescue <a href="https://www.facebook.com/red.rose.rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked to an article about the Grand Rapids arrests</a>, saying that the “rescue movement seems to be coming back to life, especially after the recent Dobbs decision overturned Roe.” Red Rose Rescue is part of a specific brand of intervention: Activists enter clinic waiting rooms in a group and hand out materials about alternatives to abortion to women waiting for their appointments (and in the case of Red Rose Rescue, roses), <a href="https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/lauren-handy-jailed-as-pro-life-rescue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often refusing to leave</a> until they’re arrested. </p>

		</aside><p data-paragraph="main">Anti-abortion protesters see these acts as a desperate attempt to help women understand the gravity of the decision they’re making, and to give them an opportunity to change their minds. But to the people who work at clinics — and to the patients themselves, who <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(12)00815-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually don’t have any doubts</a> about the procedure by the time they get to their appointments — the blockades and incursions are disruptive and frightening. Part of the problem, Ziegler said, is that it’s never clear when a confrontation will become violent. Some of the people who ultimately murdered abortion providers <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-11-mn-1021-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started as protesters</a> standing peacefully outside clinics. “You just don’t know who is dangerous, or will become dangerous,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The police are, in theory, a resource that abortion providers can tap. But Roxanne Sutocky, the director of community engagement at The Women’s Centers, a group of abortion clinics along the East Coast, said that calling the police can be complicated. For one thing, patients who have had negative experiences with the police may not find their presence especially calming. And Sutocky said that the response can vary a lot depending on the culture of the local police department: “We don’t always get the response [from the police] that’s appropriate to the level of harassment or violence we’re facing.” </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1367" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1_07.29.22_538_Partners-in-Abortion-Care_JeremyElvas_WP.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1_07.29.22_538_Partners-in-Abortion-Care_JeremyElvas_WP.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1_07.29.22_538_Partners-in-Abortion-Care_JeremyElvas_WP.jpg?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1_07.29.22_538_Partners-in-Abortion-Care_JeremyElvas_WP.jpg?w=2048 2x"><figcaption>Security is a top priority for Horvath and Nuzzo as they build out the clinic. <p>Jeremy Elvas for FiveThirtyEight</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And some of the threats happen away from the clinic. It’s not hard, for instance, to figure out where an abortion provider lives, particularly if they own their home. “We’ve had staff followed home from facilities,” said Sutocky. Once, she said, she got a piece of hate mail addressed to her at the clinic, with her home address in the return address spot on the envelope. “The message was pretty clear, and it really did scare me,” she said. “It’s hard not to be afraid for your family.” It’s not uncommon for anti-abortion activists to find abortion providers’ homes and <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/dc-neighbors-receive-abortion-doctor-flyers/65-6deb2cb9-0ba9-4c50-a4f1-bc34ebec26be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plaster their neighborhood</a> with threatening flyers. And things can escalate far beyond threats. In 1998, Dr. Barnett Slepian, an abortion provider in upstate New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/nyregion/abortion-doctor-in-buffalo-slain-sniper-attack-fits-violent-pattern.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned from synagogue on a Friday evening</a> and <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/20-years-later-barnett-slepians-murder-still-haunts/article_80f9b995-56ef-5ea8-a338-176bb88e909c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was heating split-pea soup in the microwave</a> when he was shot through the kitchen window by an anti-abortion extremist. He died within two hours.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After they decided to open their clinic, one of the first things Nuzzo and Horvath did was to hire Brightlines, an anti-doxing service for people whose security is at risk, to scrub the internet of as much of their personal information as possible. Shauna Dillavou, the company’s founder and CEO, told me that it’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/anti-abortion-protesters-target-clinics-landlord-outside-childs-md-school/2011/09/12/gIQAn8z2NK_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not just easy</a> for anti-abortion activists to find home addresses. “You can also find out where a doctor’s kid goes to school, where their partner works,” she said. That information can be weaponized too: Dillavou said that one of her clients was falsely reported to Child Protective Services for abusing or neglecting their children. Simply knowing that an abortion provider has children is a risk that has <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2022/07/17/dr-caitlin-bernard-daughter-kidnapping-threat-in-2020/65375223007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led to kidnapping threats</a>. “Or a partner can be threatened at their job,” Dillavou said. “Like, ‘Did you know your wife is a “baby killer”?’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nuzzo, for her part, seems largely resigned to a life of constant unease. As we stood in the waiting room of the clinic, inspecting the new ice machine that had just arrived, a man knocked on the door. Nuzzo immediately straightened, her whole body on guard. “Hello, sir,” she said loudly through the door, tension radiating through her voice. “How can I help you?”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">He turned out to be a sales representative for a medical device company. Nuzzo sent him on his way and turned back to me. “Every strange man knocking at the door is just a new adventure,” she said. I asked her if she’d feel safer once the clinic was open and full of people, with all the new security measures in place. “Honestly?” she said. “I don’t think I’ll ever feel safe again.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In Minnesota’s special general election on Tuesday, Republican Brad Finstad won by only 4 percentage points in the 1st Congressional District, where then-President Donald Trump won by double digits in 2020, adding evidence to the idea that the GOP is experiencing a backlash after the Supreme Court’s decision on abortion. </p>

They also look at how incumbents are faring in the midterm primaries overall and discuss the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s home in Florida, and what that may mean for the Justice Department’s larger investigation.</p>

For the better part of two years now, crime and gun violence have consistently been in the news and on the minds of Americans, which is why we’re taking a closer look at the topic in the fourth installment of our <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a single combined issue, “crime or gun violence” has consistently ranked as a top concern in our survey. We’ve asked the same 2,000 or so Americans since late April using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a> about what they think are the country’s most important issues, and in our latest wave, 33 percent of the 1,538 adults who responded named crime or gun violence as a top issue facing the country, making it the second-most important topic of the 20 we asked about.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted July 21-Aug. 1, 2022. As was the case in the previous waves of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. Sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

But even before the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that killed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/victims-texas-school-shooting-uvalde/story?id=84948395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 children and two teachers</a> at an elementary school, Americans ranked crime or gun violence as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-2000-americans-about-their-biggest-concern-the-resounding-answer-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-most important</a> issue facing the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, not everyone in our survey is prioritizing the issue in the same way. Democrats are more likely to cite it as a problem than either independents<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independents included respondents who identified as “independent” or “something else,” or who skipped the question for party identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> or Republicans. In the latest wave of our survey, 44 percent of Democrats named it as a top issue for the country, compared with 31 percent of independents and 26 percent of Republicans. Moreover, Democrats have ranked it either first or second in every wave of our poll, while independents have placed it consistently in their top three issues and Republicans in their top six.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of what we’re seeing here is that different people fixate on different aspects of crime or gun violence. “Looting, stealing, trying to hack computers, always looking to take from others,” said a 77-year old man from New York who identified as a Republican and homed in on acts of thievery. Meanwhile, a 37-year old woman from Minnesota who identified as a Democrat focused more on gun violence. “I’m much more afraid of the mass shooting epidemic in this country than of any random acts of crime,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s why we tried to dig deeper in this survey to better understand how people think about crime and gun violence. Do they think about them separately, for instance? To help answer this, we asked respondents to rank a list of 12 words or phrases by how much they associated each with either “crime” or “gun violence.” And as the chart below shows, we found people tended to associate “shooting” and “murder” strongly with gun violence, whereas there wasn’t as clear a pattern for which words they associated most with crime. Forty to 70 percent ranked “shooting,” “murder” and “firearm” in the top three words associated with gun violence, while 35 percent to 48 percent put “robbery,” “murder,” “burglary,” “shooting” and “assault” among their top three for crime. Some Americans also associated gun violence more with mental well-being, as 18 percent placed “mental health” in their top-three phrases for gun violence.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked about crime first to try and eliminate potential biases associated with gun violence. We calculated the rank as the weighted share of respondents who ranked each word or phrase in their top three of 12 choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a></p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title='"Crime" and "gun violence" mean different things to Americans' aria-label="Range Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/P8d6N/11/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="449" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In addition to asking respondents which words or phrases they associated with crime or gun violence, we also asked which of the two they thought was a bigger issue facing the country.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents could also say they were “not concerned about either” or skip the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> Among those who named crime or gun violence as a top issue, 77 percent picked gun violence as the “bigger issue,” compared with only 21 percent who chose crime. This was also true among all respondents, although the gap was less lopsided: Fifty-five percent chose gun violence, and 34 percent named crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, despite the greater concern over gun violence, independents were pretty split on how they viewed the issue, siding more with Democrats on the importance of gun violence as a major issue and more with Republicans on the question of how best to address crime.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-view-crime-gun-violence-issues-fivethirtyeight-88152853</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And 56 percent of independents said gun violence was the bigger issue, compared with 29 percent who said crime. “Just look at the rest of the world mocking ‘Americans and their guns.’ We’re killing ourselves. I don't want to fear everyday places: school, grocery, church, the mall, a parade,” said a 46-year old woman from California who identified as an independent who leaned Republican. Similarly, when asked whether they preferred gun laws that were more strict, less strict or upheld the status quo, 60 percent of independents said they supported more restrictions, which was about halfway between where Democrats (87 percent) and Republicans (35 percent) stood on this question (61 percent overall preferred stricter regulations).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, a majority of independents sided with Republicans on the question of how to best spend resources to address crime. Fifty-five percent of independents said increasing police funding would reduce crime, while 38 percent favored redirecting some police spending to social services instead. This majority view among independents was still less pronounced than among Republicans, 83 percent of whom supported increasing police spending, while only a minority of Democrats (36 percent) thought increasing police spending would reduce crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, though, crime or gun violence was an issue that Americans had seen a lot of in the news. Sixty-seven percent said they’d seen “a lot” of coverage in the past month, which was bested by only inflation (68 percent).<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in previous waves, respondents were asked whether they had seen a lot of coverage of the 20 major issues we asked about in the past month, including “other” and “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> Eddie Ellison, a Black man from Georgia who identified as an independent, told us, “Everywhere, every time you turn the news on, all you see is gun violence, murders and robberies and stuff like this.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s perhaps one reason why Americans’ understanding of crime and gun violence was pretty accurate. For instance, we found that 60 percent knew that the U.S. has the highest number of gun deaths per capita among all developed countries. The same percentage correctly identified that the number of active shooter incidents has changed over the last 20 years (it’s increased). Additionally, 51 percent correctly said that violent crime, such as murder and rape, increased in 2020, the last year for which we have data, while only 9 percent incorrectly said it hadn’t (38 percent said they didn’t know). </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans aren't bad on crime stats but overstate trends" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a9RDT/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="799" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That said, Americans also overstated the rate of violent crime and property crime compared to the past, probably in part because we tend to forget about things that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t happened recently</a>. Indeed, 49 percent said the rate of violent crime was higher in 2020 than in 1991 — it wasn’t — while 41 percent said the rate of crimes like burglary and car theft hadn’t been declining since 2010, when, in fact, it has. These weren’t meant to be “gotcha” questions, mind you. Instead, we wanted to get a sense of how levels of concern compared to the actual data on crime and gun violence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the subject of policy ideas Americans would like to see implemented to potentially reduce gun violence, there was a lot of agreement, however. At least 74 percent backed a host of different requirements, such as safety training before purchasing a gun, universal background checks for all gun sales, a mandatory mental health evaluation before a gun sale and raising the minimum age to buy a firearm from 18 to 21.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were classified as in support of these five proposals if they said they “strongly support” or “somewhat support” a proposal. Respondents could also say that they were “not familiar” with a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This was an area of relative bipartisan agreement, too, as majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents supported each of these proposals. “They need to have a better screening process as to who’s able to purchase a gun,” said Stephanie Brown, a Black woman from Virginia who identified as a Democrat. The least popular measure was requiring gun purchasers to prove they would properly store weapons, but 68 percent still backed that proposal, including 53 percent of Republicans. Amalia Williams, a Hispanic woman from Arizona who identified as a Republican, told us the process for buying a gun should be similar to the immigration process in the U.S., where people’s backgrounds are vetted. “They should do something like that with American citizens so that it takes months to get a gun,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Americans didn’t necessarily think implementing these policies would be a panacea, or that people shouldn’t be able to own guns. Only a 41 percent plurality thought greater restrictions on gun ownership would reduce mass shootings, while 35 percent disagreed (22 percent said they didn’t know). Meanwhile, half of all respondents agreed that guns were necessary to defend themselves and their property, and 47 percent said all Americans should have the right to own a gun, compared with just 39 percent who disagreed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Concerns around gun violence could be politically beneficial for Democrats, who along with independents are more likely to name it as a bigger concern than crime. After all, Democrats and independents (and even some Republicans) tend to back certain restrictions on gun purchases, and 3 in 5 Americans broadly said they’d prefer stricter gun laws. However, Republicans led Democrats on the generic ballot in our poll, which asks voters which party they’d back in the race for Congress, 40 percent to 38 percent among likely voters. This marked a very slight shift — within the margin of error — back in the GOP’s direction after Democrats took a 1-point lead a month ago. We’ve seen Democrats continue to gain in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s generic ballot tracker</a>, so this could be a blip, but it’s a reminder that with the larger concerns about the economy — especially inflation — it’s hard to imagine issues like gun violence and crime completely ameliorating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the presidential party’s midterm penalty</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The busy August primary season continues apace today with elections in Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin. Yesterday, my colleague Nathaniel Rakich <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-republican-primaries-and-a-special-election-to-watch-in-minnesota-and-wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dug into the Republican primaries of note</a>, so now we’re going to take a look at four primaries of note on the Democratic side. Three of these races involve progressive Democrats who are on course to defeat their challengers — two in heavily Democratic congressional districts in Vermont and Minnesota and one in Wisconsin’s highly competitive Senate race. (The other Democratic primary involves a red-leaning House seat in Wisconsin that Democrats will have a challenging time defending this November.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So without further ado, here are those contests in order of poll-closing times.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP21347533179614-3X2.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP21347533179614-3X2.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP21347533179614-3X2.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP21347533179614-3X2.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Vermont is the only state that has yet to elect a woman to Congress, but State Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint — who is currently leading Lt. Gov. Molly Gray in polls — could change that, should she win the deep-blue state’s at-large House seat in November. <p>Kristopher Radder / The Brattleboro Reformer / AP, File</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Vermont</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Race to watch:</strong> At-Large Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>7 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been 16 years since Vermont had an open-seat race for Congress, but a series of falling dominoes has precipitated a high-profile Democratic primary in the state’s <strong>at-large district</strong>. Longtime Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/15/leahy-most-senior-senator-will-retire-522356" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his retirement</a> in November, prompting Democratic Rep. Peter Welch <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2021/11/22/rep-peter-welch-announces-run-us-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to run for his seat</a>, leaving Vermont’s one House district open. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two major Democratic contenders have emerged in this race: state Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint and Lt. Gov. Molly Gray. And thanks to the state’s solidly blue lean, the primary victor will almost certainly win in November, so Vermont appears set to send its first woman to Congress, <a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/08/vermont-women-congress-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making it the 50th and final state to do so</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race between Balint and Gray isn’t as close as it <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1693&amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once was</a>, however, as the more progressive Balint <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/07/27/unh-poll-shows-becca-balint-with-lopsided-lead-over-molly-gray-in-democratic-us-house-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has held sizable leads</a> in the race’s two most recent surveys. In late July, the liberal pollster <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/7/29/becca-balint-leads-molly-gray-by-32-point-margin-in-vermonts-at-large-congressional-democratic-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data for Progress found</a> Balint leading 59 percent to 27 percent, and around the same time, a survey from <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1700&amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the University of New Hampshire/WCAX</a> found Balint up 63 percent to 21 percent. (Both surveys were of likely Democratic primary voters.) Moreover, while the two candidates were similarly well-known in the UNH poll, Balint was much more well-liked: Seventy-three percent held a favorable view of Balint, compared with just 42 percent for Gray.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Balint <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/07/28/metro/will-next-member-squad-come-vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has campaigned</a> on her accomplishments in the state legislature and has also racked up financial support and endorsements. She’s <a href="https://youtu.be/ssevoJz4KlM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted her status</a> as the first woman <a href="https://www.advocate.com/politics/2020/11/24/lesbian-named-vermonts-first-woman-senate-president-pro-tempore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to ever lead the state Senate</a> and her efforts to pass <a href="https://youtu.be/lktESK8Zfik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gun violence prevention measures</a>. Balint has also focused on the importance of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVEcHBHIWM8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting efforts to roll back</a> voting rights, reproductive rights and same-sex marriage, and noted the effect this would have on her life, as she is a lesbian who is <a href="https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/woman-on-the-rise-becca-balints-ascent-from-stay-at-home-mom-to-senate-majority-leader/Content?oid=12923553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">married with two children</a>. On the money front, Balint <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2VT01076/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had raised</a> $1.1 million as of July 20, and she’s also benefited from $1.3 million <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=VT01&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in outside support</a>, mostly from the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00476978/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ Victory Fund</a>. Endorsements from progressive leaders, <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/07/06/bernie-sanders-endorses-becca-balint-for-us-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most notably</a> Vermont’s own Sen. Bernie Sanders, have also burnished her standing in the race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unlike Balint, Gray does have a statewide win on her resume, <a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2020/11/04/vermont-lieutenant-governor-race-democratic-candidate-molly-gray-wins-2020-scott-milne/6158492002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning the lieutenant governor</a> election in 2020 after upsetting <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/08/04/ashe-siegel-fracture-progressive-support-in-lieutenant-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a more seasoned state legislator</a> in the Democratic primary. But while she’s largely matched Balint in fundraising, raising <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2VT01068/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little over</a> $1 million, it hasn’t been enough to keep the race close. Gray <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/06/27/gray-balint-campaigns-go-tit-for-tat-on-super-pacs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tried to make hay out</a> of Balint’s outside support, criticizing “dark money” in the race, but it seems Balint’s lengthy track record and progressive record have put her in pole position over Gray.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Race to watch:</strong> 5th Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Minnesota’s one notable Democratic primary comes in a deep-blue seat, the Minneapolis-based <strong>5th District</strong>, where progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar faces a challenge from her right by former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels. Omar, who is part of “The Squad,” a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group of progressive members of Congress</a> who are mostly women of color, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/group-house-democrats-condemn-rep-omar-remarks-about-u-s-n1270290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has attracted intraparty criticism</a> over <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/06/10/house-democrats-roiled-by-ilhan-omar-comments-on-israel-hamas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her past statements about Israel</a>, and she also joined a handful of other progressives in breaking with her party to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-minnesota-ilhan-omar-congress-736eefa85c65f21726fa9b0eb9f783c7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oppose the bipartisan infrastructure package</a> passed in 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Samuels has attempted to capitalize on these clashes by <a href="https://youtu.be/hXK6ZuTbRyM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running on the message</a> that “any politician can make a point” but that he’ll “make a difference.” He’s also <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/15/minnesota-policing-ilhan-omar-reelection-don-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made policing</a> a major part of his campaign, as he was a <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/elections/2022/07/omar-samuels-locked-in-intra-party-democratic-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prominent opponent</a> of Question 2, a 2021 city ballot initiative that would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a Department of Public Safety. In contrast, Omar <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ellison-and-omar-support-minneapolis-policing-ballot-question/600092577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported the measure</a>, which <a href="https://vote.minneapolismn.gov/results-data/election-results/2021/ballot-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed at the ballot box</a>, 44 percent to 56 percent. Samuels <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MN05208/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised a solid amount</a> for a primary challenger — almost $1.1 million — and won <a href="https://www.startribune.com/samuels-over-omar-in-dfl-primary/600194820/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the endorsement</a> from Minneapolis’s big newspaper, the Star Tribune.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Omar has proven herself capable of holding off a well-funded challenger. In 2020, <a href="https://electionresults.sos.state.mn.us/Results/Index?ersElectionId=135&amp;scenario=USRepresentative&amp;districtId=560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she defeated</a> fellow Democrat Antone Melton-Meaux, 58 percent to 39 percent, even though Melton-Meaux also ran to her right and <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/07/16/challenger-meltonmeaux-outraises-rep-ilhan-omar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outraised her</a> in the primary. This time around, though, Omar has outraised her challenger, having brought in $2.4 million, and she’s already spent $2.1 million on the campaign, evidence that she’s not taking any chances against Samuels. We don’t have any independent polling, but Omar <a href="https://changeresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ilhan-for-Congress_Polling-Methods-Questions_June-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did release a survey</a> in June from Change Research that showed her ahead of Samuels, 60 percent to 21 percent. Considering her electoral track record, incumbency and financial edge, Omar remains a clear favorite.</p>

Gov. Mandela Barnes has raised over $7 million in his campaign for U.S. Senate. <p>Sara Stathas / The Washington Post</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Wisconsin</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, 3rd Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong><strong> </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A couple weeks ago, the Democratic primary for <strong>Senate</strong> in Wisconsin was set to be one of the biggest races on the ballot today. But instead, progressive Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is his party’s presumptive nominee after all three of his leading opponents <a href="https://www.wpr.org/once-competitive-race-wisconsins-democratic-u-s-senate-primary-all-decided" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out and endorsed him</a>. Barnes’s all-but-certain victory puts him on a collision course with Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who has held this seat for two terms but has attracted controversy with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/22/sen-ron-johnson-under-fire-over-fake-electors-disclosure-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his claims and actions regarding the 2020 presidential election</a>, including reports that he tried to push a fake slate of Wisconsin electors in an effort to prevent the certification of President Biden’s election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to November, Barnes has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/30/wisconsin-barnes-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put some distance</a> between himself and some of his past actions, such as holding a shirt that said “Abolish ICE,” likely in anticipation that Republicans will portray him as too left-wing for Wisconsin. Still, Johnson is arguably more vulnerable than he should be as an incumbent in a state that leans slightly toward his party and in a midterm where the opposition party is in the White House — FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently gives him</a> just a 2 in 3 shot of defeating Barnes. Early polling has been scarce, but a Marquette University Law School poll <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/06/22/detailed-results-of-the-marquette-law-school-poll-june-14-20-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the two candidates running neck and neck</a> in a hypothetical matchup in June.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the anticlimactic Senate race, the <strong>3rd District</strong> in western Wisconsin is now the Democrats’ most interesting congressional primary in the Badger State. Democratic Rep. Ron Kind <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-all-those-house-retirements-mean-for-democrats-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is retiring</a> after 13 terms in the House. His departure and the <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/wisconsin-decisive-again-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rightward drift of the region</a> have imperiled Democrats’ chances of holding the seat, which is 9 points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> Despite these challenges, three notable Democrats are vying to be their party’s choice to defend the seat this fall: state Sen. Brad Pfaff, former CIA officer Deb McGrath and businesswoman Rebecca Cooke.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although we have no polling to go on, Pfaff may be the favorite heading into the primary. After all, he’s been able to <a href="https://youtu.be/laosryGbLyE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play up his endorsement</a> from Kind (Pfaff was formerly <a href="https://www.wpr.org/us-rep-ron-kind-endorses-state-sen-brad-pfaff-3rd-congressional-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kind’s chief of staff</a>). He also has a proven electoral track record as a state legislator and he’s raised $722,000. But his two opponents can’t be written off, as McGrath has raised $639,000 and Cooke has raised $432,000. McGrath has also <a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/mcgrath-skydives-in-3rd-cd-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grabbed attention with an ad</a> in which she goes skydiving, playing up her background as a former Army parachutist while arguing “sometimes it takes a mom to get things done.” Cooke, meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/SD-TWJmXgDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has highlighted her background</a> growing up on a farm while touting her support from organized labor groups, including the <a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/cooke-campaign-seiu-wisconsin-state-council-international-union-of-painters-allied-trades-district-council-82-endorse-rebecca-cooke-for-congress-in-wi-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Service Employees International Union Wisconsin State Council</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The eventual Democratic nominee will be in for a tough fight, however, considering the partisan lean of the district. Republicans have coalesced around retired Navy SEAL Derrick Van Orden, who lost to Kind by <a href="https://elections.wi.gov/media/12114/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 3 points</a> in 2020. Van Orden <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0WI03175/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has already raised</a> $4.5 million, giving him a huge resource advantage ahead of the November election.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Sunday, the Senate passed the largest climate change intervention bill in American history, the Inflation Reduction Act. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses whether Democrats could turn around Biden’s approval rating with this newest piece of legislation, assuming they can get it through the House. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The team then reviews <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ny-gov-kathy-hochul-has-early-lead-over-republican-rival-lee-zeldin-polls-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a polling experiment</a> that tested how live polls by Siena College compared with online and text message polls by Emerson College. They also give a preview of the latest round of polling from FiveThirtyEight’s collaboration with Ipsos, which broke down how Americans view gun violence and crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the crew checks in on debates surrounding new abortion bans around the country, including Indiana’s, which was the first new legislation since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to ban abortions with few exceptions.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In summertime, I like to head north to beat the heat — and that’s exactly what we’re doing with Tuesday’s elections. The upper-latitude states of Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin are all holding their primaries on Tuesday, and Minnesota — the nation’s <a href="https://www.unitedstatesnow.org/why-is-minnesota-called-the-north-star-state.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">north star</a> — is also hosting a special election that could provide clues to the country’s political mood. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you haven’t been following these elections closely, never fear: As always, FiveThirtyEight is previewing every race with major implications for November. My colleague Geoffrey Skelley will run down the Democratic primaries of note tomorrow, but today let’s start with that special election and three big Republican primaries in two of those states.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22145631775840-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22145631775840-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22145631775840-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP22145631775840-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Former state Rep. Brad Finstad is in the unusual situation of running in both the special election and the primary for Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. <p>Mark Zdechlik / Minnesota Public Radio / AP</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Minnesota</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st Congressional District (both the regular primary and special election)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/02/18/minnesota-1st-district-representative-jim-hagedorn-dies-at-age-59" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died of cancer</a> in February, and on Tuesday voters in Minnesota’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong> (specifically, those living within the district’s old, pre-redistricting borders) will choose his replacement for the remainder of his term. Given the seat’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> of R+15, the Republican candidate, former state Rep. Brad Finstad, is favored over Democrat Jeff Ettinger, the former CEO of Hormel Foods.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s not a guaranteed Republican victory, and regardless of who wins, the final margin could be telling. Special elections are often a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bellwether</a> for the results of the November election; if one party consistently overperforms partisan lean in special elections, it suggests that the national political mood <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favors that party</a>. So far in the 2022 cycle, however, Republicans have overperformed in some special elections, while Democrats have overperformed in others, making it hard to say <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-can-special-elections-so-far-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which party has an advantage</a>.</p>

This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>
<p>*Top-two primaries: Vote margin is the total vote share of all Democratic candidates combined minus the total vote share of all Republican candidates combined.</p>

</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">However, in the only special election so far to take place after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats had one of their strongest performances of the cycle — coming within almost 5 percentage points of winning Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District despite the seat’s R+17 partisan lean. That may mean Democrats were highly energized in the wake of that decision … or it could have just been due to <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/notes-on-the-state-of-the-primaries-june-29-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local factors</a>, like the scandal that ended the career of the district’s former Republican representative or the strength of the Democratic candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The special election in Minnesota’s 1st District may help clarify that. If Democrats come close to winning again — or if they pull off the upset outright — it will be another data point suggesting that the national environment is improving for Democrats. (Another is the fact that polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> have shifted more than 2 points toward Democrats since the Supreme Court decision, and Democrats and Republicans are now essentially tied.)<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> A late July <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/surveyusa-poll-finstad-leads-ettinger-in-race-to-serve-remainder-of-hagedorns-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyUSA poll</a> of the race for KAAL-TV gave Finstad the support of 46 percent of likely voters and Ettinger the support of 38 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Complicating matters, though, is that this <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/elections/2022/07/most-but-not-all-1st-district-voters-will-vote-twice-on-aug-9-to-decide-who-will-represent-them-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t the only election</a> taking place in Minnesota’s 1st District on Tuesday: The district (this time in its new, post-redistricting incarnation) is also hosting its regularly scheduled primary to decide its nominees for the general election. And while Ettinger has no serious opposition on the Democratic side, Finstad actually faces a rematch from state Rep. Jeremy Munson, whom he defeated 38 percent to 37 percent in the May primary for the special election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As that margin suggests, the primary could be competitive even though Finstad is the official GOP nominee elsewhere on the ballot. Indeed, he could end up in the unusual situation of getting elected to Congress but then immediately losing “reelection” by not making it to the November ballot. This has also created a dilemma for Finstad’s campaign: court the Republican base by moving right, or tack toward the center to appeal to a general-election electorate? Finstad has opted to campaign as a “<a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/minnesota/cd1-candidates-finstad-munson-face-off-in-farmfest-debate-after-ettinger-tests-positive-for-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problem solver</a>” who will get things done, but that has left the diehard-conservative lane wide open for Munson, who is known as an <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/national/2022/05/jeremy-munson-could-be-the-next-republican-congressman-from-minnesotas-1st-district-why-are-so-many-republicans-trying-to-stop-that-from-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-establishment hardliner</a> in the state legislature and would likely join the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/house-freedom-caucus-head-spurns-congressional-widow-for-rival-gop-candidate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Caucus</a> if elected to Congress.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> Governor, attorney general</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Multiple Republicans are also jockeying for the chance to take out two vulnerable statewide Democrats in the Badger State — and Gov. Tony Evers tops their target list. Almost a year ago, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/09/09/rebecca-kleefisch-announces-run-wisconsin-governor-law-and-order-agenda-would-ban-sanctuary-cities/5754503001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the race</a> for <strong>governor</strong> with the support of her old boss, <a href="https://www.wpr.org/scott-walker-rebecca-kleefisch-would-make-hell-great-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Gov. Scott Walker</a>, and immediately catapulted to the <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MLSP68Toplines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top of the Republican field</a>. But then, in April, construction executive Tim Michels announced his own bid, and thanks to the sheer amount of <a href="https://www.wpr.org/republican-tim-michels-spends-nearly-8m-his-campaign-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">money</a> he’s pumped into his campaign — nearly $11 million as of July 25 — he’s emerged as a formidable foe to Kleefisch. Moreover, Michels got a further boost when, on June 2, he received the coveted endorsement of <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/06/02/donald-trump-endorses-tim-michels-wisconsin-governor/7488047001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump</a>. As a result, by mid-June, a <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MLSP70Toplines.html#Q44a:_Rep_primary_for_Gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marquette University poll</a> showed a virtually tied race: Michels 27 percent, Kleefisch 26 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s the most recent independent poll we have of the primary, which is particularly unfortunate given that businessman Kevin Nicholson, the third-place candidate in the race (10 percent in the Marquette poll), <a href="https://www.wpr.org/republican-kevin-nicholson-suspends-campaign-wisconsin-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended his campaign</a> in early July. Since then, we’ve gotten only an <a href="https://twitter.com/politicoalex/status/1550169733806399493?s=20&amp;t=5YWvSB8-Neico4DVaKG-ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal poll</a> from a super PAC that supports Michels. It gave Michels an 8-percentage-point lead, but remember that internal polls often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exaggerate the strength</a> of their preferred candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In recent weeks, many onetime and current Trump allies have broken with the ex-president and endorsed Kleefisch, such as <a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/mike-pence-touts-wisconsin-gop-governor-candidate-rebecca-kleefisch/article_1d22cadb-02fd-539d-ba00-3ce26ec7dc3d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Vice President Mike Pence</a> and <a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ted-cruz-endorses-rebecca-kleefisch-leading-up-to-gop-gubernatorial-primary/article_6762a356-39f7-5af5-9c92-c4521e5f9461.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Ted Cruz</a>. But the ideological fault lines in this primary may be the opposite of what you’d expect. While Kleefisch does have ties to the party establishment, she has claimed that the 2020 election in Wisconsin was “<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/27/rebecca-kleefisch-says-2020-election-rigged-compares-deflategate/9551852002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rigged</a>,” while the outsider Michels has been <a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/michels-unsure-if-2020-election-was-stolen-says-hes-focused-on-2022-after-winning-trump-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coyer on the subject</a>, saying he doesn’t know whether the election was stolen and that it is time to move on. He also <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/05/25/governor-candidate-tim-michels-reverses-course-elections-commission/9922775002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially resisted</a> abolishing the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, which most pro-Trump Republicans (including the other candidates for governor) want to do because they blame it for President Biden’s victory in the state (though Michels eventually came around to the idea of eliminating it). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For what it’s worth, a few Trump true believers, such as his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, have <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/12/trump-backed-conspiracy-theorist-tim-ramthun-enters-race-for-governor/6750802001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed another candidate</a>, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun, who has centered his campaign on decertifying the 2020 election in Wisconsin. However, he is clocking in only the single digits in the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other major Democratic incumbent that Republicans are hoping to beat is <strong>Attorney General</strong> Josh Kaul, who has said that he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-wisconsin-431bdc117a5ca8a9608d1ba8250f6084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will not enforce the state’s 1849 abortion ban</a> and is <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2022/06/28/kaul-files-lawsuit-challenging-1849-abortion-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suing to have it effectively overturned</a>. By contrast, the two main Republicans seeking to challenge him, former state Assembly member Adam Jarchow and Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney, have both said they would <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/14/wisconsin-attorney-general-election-candidates-abortion-law-after-roe-v-wade-overturned/7755800001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enforce the ban</a>. There are no public polls of the GOP primary, but Jarchow outraised Toney by about <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0105531FallPre-Primary20225f3d581202263005PMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$542,000</a> to nearly <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0106408FallPre-Primary20224d0b281202290740PMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$113,000</a> between Jan. 1 and July 25.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A third Republican candidate, attorney Karen Mueller, has focused her campaign more on <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/03/31/attorney-who-backs-election-decertification-ivermectin-enters-ag-race/7209427001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coronavirus- and election-related conspiracy theories</a>, saying she would investigate hospitals whose doctors refused to administer the antiparasitic drug ivermectin to COVID-19 patients and that the 2020 election should be decertified. However, her anemic fundraising (about <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0106511FallPre-Primary20222107f812022125135AMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$41,000</a> for the year) suggests she’s not a serious threat to win.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Politics doesn’t have a farm system in the way that professional baseball does. But it has a hierarchy of its own for cultivating political prospects. The path usually goes something like this: First, a candidate wins some relatively minor, local office like city council or state representative. Then, they either win a seat in the U.S. House or a statewide office like attorney general. Only then do they run for U.S. Senate or governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most of the Democrats running in competitive Senate and gubernatorial races have followed a version of this course. For instance, John Fetterman, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, was the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, for 13 years before being elected as the state’s lieutenant governor in 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But most of the Republicans haven’t. As a group, they have little experience running for office, and even less experience at actually <em>winning</em> general elections. Historically, such candidates have a poor track record — and in 2022 they could cost Republicans key gubernatorial races as well as control of the Senate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight’s model evaluates candidate experience as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of our “fundamentals” calculation</a>.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, our algorithm to predict race outcomes using factors other than polling, which we then combine with the polling average in each state to create a blended forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> Specifically, for Senate and gubernatorial candidates, we use a four-tiered system based on the candidate’s highest <em>elected</em><a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appointed offices don’t count&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> office:</p>



<ul><li>Tier 3: U.S. Senator or governor</li><li>Tier 2: U.S. representative or statewide elected office (e.g., secretary of state) or mayor of a large city</li><li>Tier 1: Any other nontrivial elected office (e.g., state senator)</li><li>Tier 0: Has never held any nontrivial elected office</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">The reason that experience in winning past elections can send a valuable statistical signal isn’t necessarily that experience in elected office is valuable unto itself. (For instance, candidates who are <em>appointed</em> to the U.S. Senate following a vacancy have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/appointed-senators-rarely-win-re/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor track records at winning a Senate term for themselves</a>.) Rather, it’s the act of <em>winning</em> an election that counts, since it’s a sign that a candidate is acceptable to some reasonably large group of voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s take a look at the experience level of nominees and presumed nominees running in competitive<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, races rated by FiveThirtyEight as toss-up, lean or likely.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have an average experience score of 2.5 in these races, and all the candidates they’ve nominated or are projected to nominate qualify in at least the second tier of experience. Republicans’ average experience rating is just 1.0, by contrast. That’s partly because they have fewer incumbents running, but even if you exclude incumbents from the average, there’s still a huge gap: non-incumbent Democrats have an average experience rating of 2.0 versus 0.5 for Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the Republican nominees for Senate in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania have never held elected office before. Nor has the party’s presumed nominee in New Hampshire, Donald Bolduc.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolduc &lt;a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1692&amp;amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;easily led the only poll of the GOP primary&lt;/a&gt; in New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having held elected office is not a prerequisite for higher office, and one can think of plenty of candidates, from Elizabeth Warren to Ted Cruz, who won races for the U.S. Senate as first-time candidates. Even so, some of them had pedigrees in politics or politics-related fields. Cruz had been solicitor general of Texas, for instance — an unelected office but one that gave him a significant public profile. Mark Kelly, the Democratic incumbent in Arizona, won a Senate race in his first election in 2020, but he had been an astronaut (often a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut-politician#:~:text=In%201985%2C%20Senator%20Jake%20Garn,also%20as%20a%20payload%20specialist." target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful launching pad for political careers</a>) and is the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year’s crop of Republican nominees doesn’t have those advantages. For instance, Democrats have a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/opinion/blake-masters-arizona-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">variety of potential attack lines against Blake Masters</a>, the newly minted Republican Senate nominee in Arizona, from his ties to controversial billionaire Peter Thiel to his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-gop-senate-candidate-masters-privatizing-social-security-2022-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggestions that he might privatize Social Security</a>.

<p data-paragraph="main">You can see another big gap there: Democrats have an average experience rating of 2.4, as compared to 1.4 for Republicans. Excluding incumbents, Democrats have an average rating of 1.7, versus 1.0 for Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s important to note that we shouldn’t regard this as some sort of unlucky fluke for the GOP. Rather, this is part and parcel of the modern Republican Party. Former President Donald Trump didn’t have much political experience when he ran against the party establishment in 2016. Since then he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/opinion/liz-cheney-trump-jan-6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly intervened against candidates</a> who he thought were insufficiently loyal to him, regardless of their political pedigrees.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, there are Republicans who challenge Trump — like <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/26/sununu-bucks-trump-in-2024-00027612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu</a>. But that’s a case in point: Sununu <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/09/sununu-wont-run-for-senate-520413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose not to run for the U.S. Senate</a>. That seat is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-hampshire-is-tiny-and-pretty-weird-that-could-help-maggie-hassan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now pretty likely</a> to be retained by the Democratic incumbent, Maggie Hassan, since she’s likely to be running against an inexperienced Bolduc.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, Democratic chances to keep the Senate continue to inch upward and are now <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/?cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59 percent according to our Deluxe forecast</a> and 71 percent in the Classic version of our model. First-time candidates like Oz, Masters and Georgia’s Herschel Walker could blow races that Republicans would ordinarily be poised to win.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Aug. 5, 2022, 3:13 p.m.):</strong> The first table in this article has been updated to indicate that Donald Bolduc is not an incumbent in the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">U.S. health officials <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/us-declares-public-health-emergency-on-monkeypox-to-access-funds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared monkeypox a public health emergency</a> on Thursday, a move that frees up additional resources for vaccines and other treatments to help control the virus’s outbreak. The federal announcement comes just days after California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker both <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/california-governor-declares-monkeypox-state-emergency-87774929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared public health emergencies</a> in their respective states. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A number of states</a> have reported an uptick in monkeypox cases. The virus — which was recently detected in the U.S. <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/key-questions-about-the-current-u-s-monkeypox-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in mid-May</a> but came to the country at least once before, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5227a5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2003</a> — has led to mild outbreaks across the U.S., with areas like New York, Washington, D.C., and Florida <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/07/18/monkeypox-dc-vaccine-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bearing some of the highest case rates</a> by population. But according to recent polling, a majority of Americans aren’t paying close attention to the disease and aren’t that concerned about the outbreaks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Per a May survey from <a href="https://civicscience.com/concern-about-being-in-public-on-the-rise-but-not-due-to-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CivicScience</a>, 36 percent of U.S. adults said they were “somewhat concerned” with the spread of monkeypox in the country, versus 45 percent who were “not at all concerned.” Moreover, the percentage of Americans who told CivicScience that they were not at all worried about being in public places has significantly increased this year, from 29 percent in early January to 41 percent in late May. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The lack of concern could be, in part, because a majority of Americans aren’t paying particular attention to news regarding the outbreak. A May survey from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/pxr4um0yc2/20220528_econtoplines_revised.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a>, for instance, found that only 11 percent of respondents were following updates regarding monkeypox very closely. Thirty-three percent said they were paying attention to a certain extent, but the bulk of Americans (56 percent) said they weren’t following the news very closely — if at all. Those numbers haven’t increased significantly either, despite an uptick in cases <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/video/as-monkeypox-spreads-heres-how-to-stay-safe-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the summer</a>. A July poll from <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/survey-1-in-5-americans-fear-getting-monkeypox-but-many-know-little-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania</a> found that just 19 percent of Americans were concerned about getting monkeypox over the next several months. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that worries regarding the virus could change following the federal government’s latest announcement. But there’s still <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/07/researchers-monkeypox-00037620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot we don’t know</a> about the outbreak, and that lack of knowledge among experts could also be a reason why Americans seem largely unaware of how contagious the virus is and whether there’s a vaccine available. In July, just before New York’s Department of Health declared monkeypox <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2022/2022-07-28_monkeypox_virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an imminent threat to public health</a>, the same Annenberg Public Policy Center poll found that nearly half (48 percent) of Americans were unsure whether monkeypox was more contagious than COVID-19 (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/monkeypox-virus-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not</a>). Another 66 percent of respondents said they either didn’t know or didn’t believe there was a monkeypox vaccine (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/considerations-for-monkeypox-vaccination.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Concern about the virus might also be low because there’s a stigma associated with it. So far, the outbreak appears to mostly affect <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2207323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gay and bisexual men</a>. On the one hand, this means public health systems have been able to <a href="https://theconversation.com/monkeypox-an-expert-explains-what-gay-and-bisexual-men-need-to-know-187882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target their messaging</a> to the communities that appear most at risk. But that also carries the risk of villainizing these populations <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-has-led-to-an-uptick-in-anti-asian-racism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar to how Asian Americans</a> were targeted at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. There’s also an ongoing effort to change the name of the virus amid criticism that its current moniker is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/15/1105188732/monkeypox-new-name-who-world-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discriminatory and stigmatizing</a> and that it <a href="https://virological.org/t/urgent-need-for-a-non-discriminatory-and-non-stigmatizing-nomenclature-for-monkeypox-virus/853" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unfairly associates transmission of the disease</a> with Central and West Africa, despite the current international outbreak having no central connections to those regions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, it’s dangerous for Americans to presume that monkeypox poses a threat <em>only </em>to men who have sex with men. To be sure, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/0509-monkeypox-transmission.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is not an airborne virus</a> and is not as easy to contract as, say, COVID-19. (It also cannot be easily passed through casual skin contact, is not as deadly COVID-19 and doesn’t usually lead to hospitalization.) But that <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/07/1123212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t mean other populations</a> aren’t at risk of contracting it or that monkeypox can’t eventually escalate into another pandemic given that the virus has seemingly become more transmissible this go-around. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unfortunately, at least for now, there’s just not enough data to know how bad the monkeypox outbreak might get. It’s why public health officials are asking everyone to remain vigilant while President Biden’s administration ramps up measures to combat it at the state and federal level. Public health officials are optimistic that the viral illness is not like COVID-19, but they are still advising everyone to exercise caution in situations where one can’t maintain a sense of personal space. Americans may be currently taking a lax attitude toward monkeypox, but in reality, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the disease.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Only about one-quarter of Americans report being “very” (8 percent) or “somewhat” concerned (18 percent) that President Biden’s recent COVID-19 diagnosis could inhibit the government from performing its duties, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/07/28/americans-reactions-president-biden-getting-covid">according to a YouGov poll conducted July 23-26</a>. That said, many Americans are broadly concerned that Biden’s age and health have adversely affected his capacity to perform presidential duties: Forty-two percent said these factors severely limited his ability to fulfill his role, while adults 65 and older (Biden’s own demographic) were the most likely of any age group (50 percent) to agree.</li><li>A majority of Americans (59 percent) don’t know the definition of “carbon-neutral,” <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/02/carbon-neutral-consumer-awareness/">per a July 26 survey from Morning Consult</a>. Thirty percent said they weren’t sure, while 29 percent incorrectly identified “carbon-neutral” from a list of three choices. Interestingly, that number is very similar for self-identified environmentalists: Twenty-four percent said they didn’t know, and 32 percent gave a wrong answer. </li><li>Adults 65 and older are almost twice as likely (51 percent) as adults under 30 (27 percent) to write by hand every day, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/survey-results/daily/2022/08/03/a16cd/1">according to an Aug. 3 YouGov survey</a>. It’s a habit that varies by race, too: Forty-six percent of white Americans reported handwriting daily, compared to 33 percent of Black Americans and 34 percent of Hispanic Americans. </li><li>Younger Americans are less likely than older Americans to have read books as children, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/entertainment/articles-reports/2022/07/29/books-americans-read-growing-up-and-now">per a July 19-22 YouGov survey</a>. Seventy-nine percent of Americans under the age of 30 reported reading while growing up, compared with 95 percent of adults 65 and older. Moreover, one-third of Americans said they’ve read one or zero books in the last year, while about another third estimated they read between two and five. But 12 percent reported reading more than 20 … talk about being fully booked! </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> 39.2 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 55.7 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -16.5 points). At this time <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/murkowski-alaska-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, 39.3 percent approved and 55.7 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -16.4 points).

At this time last month, voters preferred Republicans by 2.0 points (42.8 percent to 44.8 percent).</p>]]></description>
