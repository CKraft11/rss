<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">After more than a year of distance learning, many <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/schools-plan-potential-remote-learning-fall-75752218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school-age children</a> in the U.S. have gone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/us/schools-reopen-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back to the classroom</a>. And while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/covid-schools-delta-variant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highly transmissible delta variant</a> of the coronavirus certainly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/us/covid-school-reopening-virtual-learning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triggers mixed feelings</a> about kids’ returning to school, parents have maintained for the most part that they prefer in-person learning, at least some of the time, to the entirely remote, virtual learning <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/the-great-zoom-school-experiment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that took place largely online</a> during the past school year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The debate over whether students and educators must adhere to certain safety protocols to make in-person learning possible, though, is just the latest political battle concerning COVID-19. A week ago in Florida, a judge ruled that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/judge-florida-school-districts-impose-mask-mandates-rules-79681083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schools could<em> </em>mandate mask ordinances</a> despite Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’s objections. And on Monday, the U.S. Department of Education said it had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-education-dept-opens-investigations-5-states-regarding-bans-universal-masking-2021-08-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened civil rights investigations</a> into five states that banned schools’ mask mandates to examine whether these policies were placing students with disabilities and underlying health conditions at a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19. Recent surveys underscore just how large the divide is among parents over whether students and teachers should have to wear masks or be vaccinated — assuming, in the case of students, that they are old enough to get the jab. Much of that tension, though, may have less to do with how parents identify politically and more to do with whether they’ve been vaccinated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In February, before the <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/5-things-to-know-delta-variant-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delta variant had begun to spread</a>, support for in-person schooling was incredibly high. According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/336173/amid-pandemic-parents-support-person-school.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll</a> conducted that month, over three-quarters of parents of K-12 students (79 percent) said they supported “providing in-person schooling for elementary and secondary students” in their neighborhoods. Support cut across party lines, too: 94 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of independents and 62 percent of Democrats said they were in favor of in-person schooling. Since then, however, <a href="https://mercuryllc.app.box.com/s/e1xi9zesqukxq4ugrwrc6lzy3yv1ycvd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other polls</a> have shown that support among parents has dipped, although in-person and hybrid learning are still relatively popular options. Most parents just aren’t up for completely virtual learning, and even fewer support homeschooling, according to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/return-to-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> polling from late August. For the past six months, the pollster has asked parents of 5- to 18-year-olds what they believe the best model is for K-12 students this school year, and the latest numbers showed that 36 percent preferred in-person instruction only, while 37 percent wanted a hybrid model. Only 16 percent said they wanted entirely virtual learning, and just 7 percent said they wanted to homeschool their children.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Parents see less eye-to-eye, though, on which COVID-19 safety precautions to take in schools. Per an August survey from the <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/support-for-mask-and-vaccine-mandates-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>, 31 percent of unvaccinated adults versus 71 percent of vaccinated ones said they favored mask requirements for teachers. Those numbers barely budged when respondents were asked whether students should be required to wear masks: 29 percent of unvaccinated adults and 69 percent of vaccinated ones said face coverings should be mandatory for school-age children — many of whom are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/covid-vaccination-timeline-children/619729/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not yet old enough</a> to<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/covid-vaccination-timeline-children/619729/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> get the vaccine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support things like mask mandates</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/unvaccinated-america-in-5-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely overall to have received the jab</a>, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisanship-isnt-the-only-reason-why-so-many-americans-remain-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics alone doesn’t explain</a> everything we’re seeing here. For some school-safety precautions, the gaps are biggest between those who are vaccinated and those who are not. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">​The divide is especially pronounced when respondents were asked whether teachers and students should be required to get the vaccine. That same AP/NORC survey found a 54-percentage-point gap in the views between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults when they were asked about teachers — 74 percent to 20 percent, respectively, said they were in favor of the vaccine requirement for teachers. There was a similar 52-point difference on whether students 12 and older should have to get the jab: 70 percent of vaccinated adults said they should have to, compared with only 18 percent of unvaccinated adults who said the same. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the COVID-19 vaccine is not yet approved for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vaccines-kids-under-age-12-expected-mid-winter-fda-official-n1274057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">children younger than 12</a>, so the polling on parents’ support for vaccinating their children paints a muddled picture. The AP/NORC poll suggests that among vaccinated parents, support is very high, but other polls conducted earlier this summer show relatively low support. According to a May and June <a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/only-half-of-parents-plan-to-vaccinate-their-children-new-poll-finds/2021/08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education Next survey</a> of public opinion on education policy, just a bare majority of parents with a child in grades K-12 (51 percent) said they would “probably” or “definitely” vaccinate their child. Another 34 percent said they “probably” or “definitely” would not, while 15 percent said they didn’t know. (Parents’ vaccination status was not available.) And days before the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authorized the use of the Pfizer vaccine</a> for 12- to 15-year-olds, just 30 percent of parents with at least one child in that age range said they planned to get their kid vaccinated right away, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-april-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Family Foundation survey</a>. About a quarter (26 percent) said they first wanted to wait and see how the vaccine was working, while 23 percent said they would definitely not get their child vaccinated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/religious-vaccines-covid-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine hesitancy has decreased over time</a>, it’s possible we’ll see these numbers change, too. Prominent health care leaders <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fauci-backs-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-us-school-children-2021-08-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">touting the importance</a> of vaccinating children might also sway hesitant parents. But <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354203/parents-divided-mask-mandates-school.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> found<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354203/parents-divided-mask-mandates-school.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> in mid-August that parents of K-12 students were less likely than the general public to be worried about unvaccinated people. According to the poll, 51 percent of K-12 parents said they were “very” or “moderately” worried about people in their area choosing not to get vaccinated, compared with 60 percent of all adults who said the same. So, it’s also possible that the earlier trends we saw with hesitancy decreasing over time might not happen. We’ll just have to wait and see, too.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The Pentagon confirmed Monday that the U.S. had <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-defend-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-leaving-americans/story?id=79744273.If">pulled out the last of its troops in Afghanistan</a> and that the evacuation operation at Kabul’s international airport had ended. Recent polling suggests a majority of Americans support the troop withdrawal. According to a new survey by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/31/majority-of-u-s-public-favors-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-biden-criticized-for-his-handling-of-situation/">Pew Research Center</a>, 54 percent of adults said the decision to evacuate U.S. troops was the right thing to do, versus 42 percent who said it wasn’t. But this finding <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-declining-approval-rating-is-not-just-about-afghanistan/">doesn’t mean</a> they’re giving President Biden high marks for how he handled the end of the 20-year war. Per Pew, just over a quarter of respondents said the president had done an “excellent” or “good” job dealing with the situation in Afghanistan; about 3 in 10 said he had done “only fair,” and just over 4 in 10 said he had done a “poor” job. </li><li>The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine">fully approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine</a>, but that appears to be having a limited impact on vaccine-hesitant Americans. In fact, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/30/pfizer-approval-vaccine-hesitancy-polling/">Morning Consult</a> found that only 29 percent of unvaccinated adults were swayed by the FDA’s approval. A clear majority of unvaccinated Americans (61 percent) said they still didn’t plan to get the vaccine — something my colleagues and I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccine-hesitancy-is-still-strong-in-many-covid-19-battered-states/">wrote about earlier this week</a>. When unvaccinated Americans were asked why they were choosing not to get the jab, most (70 percent) said they were concerned about its potential side effects, though research shows that most are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/well/live/covid-vaccine-side-effects-faq.html">short-term and mild</a>. But side effects weren’t the only concern, as 61 percent told Morning Consult that they believed vaccine requirements were an infringement on their personal freedoms. That said, a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">survey from Axios-Ipsos</a> showed the share of vaccine-hesitant Americans was lower now than it had been since the pollster started asking the question this spring: Just 20 percent of Americans said they were “not very likely” or “not at all likely” to get a COVID-19 vaccine compared with 29 percent in April.</li><li>Since 2016, trust in national media has continued to decline, especially among Republicans, according to newly released polling from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/30/partisan-divides-in-media-trust-widen-driven-by-a-decline-among-republicans/">Pew</a>. Per the survey, the share of Republicans with at least some trust in the national media has plummeted from 70 percent to 35 percent over the past five years. Meanwhile, an overwhelming majority of Democrats (78 percent) said they had “a lot” or “some” trust in national media now — relatively unchanged since 2016, when trust among this group was at 83 percent. Meanwhile, <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/articles/local-news-is-more-trusted-than-national-news-but-that-could-change/">trust in local news</a> is higher among members of both parties. According to Pew, 84 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of Republicans said they had at least some trust in the information coming out of local news outlets now. </li><li>What’s the best decade for music? Your answer to that question likely depends on when you were born, according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/americans-favorite-decade-music">new polling from Ipsos</a>. Overall, a plurality of Americans (40 percent) said the ’80s had the best music, followed by the ’70s (37 percent) and the ’90s (32 percent). But these numbers vary heavily with age. Among Generation Zers, which Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/">defines</a> as those born from 1997 onward,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no true consensus on the year Gen Z ends and Generation Alpha begins, but Gen Z &lt;a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/family/story/gen-meet-gen-alpha-generation-born-2010-today-68971965"&gt;ends around 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> 30 percent said the ’80s was the best decade for music, while the most popular choice was the 2000s, at 41 percent. Meanwhile, among Gen Xers, or those <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/">born between 1965 to 1980</a>, the ’80s was the most popular choice by far, at 61 percent; 51 percent of Baby Boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, said they preferred ’70s music. </li><li>Newly released <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/09/01/the-internet-and-the-pandemic/">polling from Pew</a> shows how beneficial the internet has been to Americans during the pandemic. According to the survey, 90 percent said the internet had been “essential” or “important” for them personally, and 81 percent said they had used video-calling services to connect with others since the early days of the pandemic in February 2020. Of course, being online all the time <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/">has its disadvantages</a>, too. A plurality of adults (40 percent) said they “often” or “sometimes” felt worn out from spending too much time on video calls, and another 33 percent said they’d attempted to cut back on the amount of time they’d been spending online. Moreover, for some, being online can’t replace face-to-face contact: 68 percent of adults said the internet was “useful” but that it couldn’t take the place of in-person contact. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval </strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In a matter of days, a novel abortion law in Texas has made it virtually impossible for women to access the procedure in the state — although the constitutional right to abortion is still intact, for now. The Texas law <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/18/texas-heartbeat-bill-abortions-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected</a>, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy. Eight other states have <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted to pass</a> similar bans, but the ban in Texas is the first to go into effect, after <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-awaits-supreme-court-move-restrictive-abortion-law/story?id=79742044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 order saying</a> that while it was not ruling one way or the other on the constitutionality of the law, it also wouldn’t pause the law while legal disputes unfolded in the lower courts because of the law’s unique structure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, women in Texas still theoretically have a right to an abortion — but almost none will be able to get one. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawyers for Texas clinics</a>, 85 to 90 percent of the abortions in the state happen after six weeks. Clinics across the state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are in chaos</a>, with overflowing waiting rooms and patients turned away in tears. At this point, it seems very likely that the law will remain in place until the legal battles are resolved, which could take months or years, making Texas into a bizarre test case — how will Americans respond when abortion is abruptly cut off in one of the nation’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/popest-nation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most populous states</a>? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to the polling we have now, the answer is far from clear. On the one hand, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority of Americans have consistently said</a> that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to abortion, should not be overturned. But many also <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support a wide range of specific restrictions on abortion</a>, some of which <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/874458692/supreme-court-hands-abortion-rights-a-victory-in-louisiana-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contradict the Supreme Court’s standards</a> for when and how states can regulate the procedure. That said, public opinion hasn’t really shifted on the issue even though abortion access has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-categorized-hundreds-of-abortion-restrictions-heres-why-the-anti-abortion-movement-is-escalating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily eroded in wide swaths of the country over the past 10 years</a>. But the fact that the Texas law directly attacks abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy — when the procedure is both most supported and most common — could galvanize public outrage in a way that past restrictions have not. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For decades, Americans have broadly opposed overturning Roe v. Wade — despite escalating attempts by anti-abortion advocates to turn public opinion against legal abortion. As the chart below shows, 58 percent of Americans were against overturning Roe when <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup last asked the question in May</a>, the same share who wanted to keep the case on the books back in 1989. </p>

In Roe and subsequent Supreme Court cases involving abortion, the justices have ruled that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/05/18/scotus-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states can’t ban abortion prior to viability</a>, which usually occurs around 24 weeks of pregnancy. Texas’s six-week ban is an obvious and dramatic departure from that standard. Some people, of course, have more extreme views on the issue: According to a Gallup poll conducted in May, 19 percent of Americans think abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, while almost twice as many (32 percent) think it should be legal in all circumstances. But most (48 percent) fall in between, saying it should be legal only under certain circumstances.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans support abortion, but not in all situations" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bj1eE/12/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="492" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">What should those circumstances be? That’s a surprisingly difficult question to answer -- in part because Americans are generally fuzzy on how specific restrictions actually affect abortion access. For instance, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, 69 percent of Americans supported requiring abortions to be performed solely by doctors with hospital admitting privileges, a restriction that has been <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/patient-support-advocacy/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-admitting-privilege" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly thrown out</a> by the Supreme Court for imposing too much of a burden on women seeking abortion. That could be good news for anti-abortion advocates, if it means that broad support for keeping Roe on the books doesn’t necessarily translate into opposition to specific abortion restrictions.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But this time, things could be different. Americans are much likelier to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/235469/trimesters-key-abortion-views.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support unrestricted abortion in the first trimester</a> of pregnancy. And that also happens to be when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most abortions occur</a>. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Support for abortion is highest in the first trimester" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OPBpP/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">So while Texas and other states have imposed plenty of other restrictions on abortion, this will cut off access significantly earlier than any other restriction since Roe was decided almost 50 years ago. And that’s the key distinction. Up until now, abortion restrictions have been fairly slow and piecemeal. But now women in Texas have lost access to abortion in most cases essentially overnight.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, the avalanche of abortion restrictions over the past decade have unquestionably made it much more difficult for women to get abortions in big chunks of the country, by making the procedure expensive and inconvenient for women to obtain -- not to mention hard for abortion providers to stay open. But while the slow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/31/us/abortion-clinics-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shuttering of clinics across the South and Midwest</a> has had a big personal cost for people across the country, that impact hasn’t really made its way into the headlines, in part because <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/18/number-of-abortions-us-drops-guttmacher-institute-study/2362316001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women have gone to great lengths</a> to obtain abortions despite the obstacles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, though, for the first time in decades, the country will get a glimpse of what happens when abortion is suddenly unavailable to nearly all women in one of the nation’s most populous states. For better or worse, Americans’ views on when abortion should be legal will probably get a lot clearer.</p>

But what does that illiberalism actually look like among elected members in Congress?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Quantifying politicians’ commitments to upholding democracy isn’t easy. Even defining “democracy” <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/conceptualizing-andmeasuring-democracy-a-new-approach/DAF249E74DDD3ACE3FFC96F20EE4074D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is complicated</a> — <a href="https://www.almendron.com/tribuna/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/conceptualizing-and-measuring-democracy-evaluating-alternative-indices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scholars disagree on its exact</a> definition — let alone trying to establish <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/b6/55/b6553f85-5c5d-45ec-be63-a48a2abe3f62/briefing_paper_9.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how closely politicians or parties</a> adhere to democratic principles. There’s no <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogowski/files/npat-paper-july2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing survey</a> of how strongly elected members of Congress believe in democratic principles, for instance, and it’s not clear what such a survey would even tell us, given that politicians (and their staffers) are often masters at spin. But just like aggregating <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Ideology-and-Congress-A-Political-Economic-History-of-Roll-Call-Voting/Poole/p/book/9781412806084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicians’ votes</a> can tell us something about where they fall ideologically on <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1057/pol.2014.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic or social policies,</a> one thing we <em>can</em> do is look at how members of Congress vote when issues of democracy are brought to the floor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the catch here is that matters of democracy are rarely brought for a floor vote. “Most aspects of democracy are not up for debate in Congress in any given year,” said <a href="https://sites.nd.edu/michael-coppedge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Coppedge</a>, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/en/global-team/principal-investigators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the principal investigators</a> at <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varieties of Democracy</a>. That’s an important caveat because the comprehensiveness of such a metric is limited by what Congress actually votes on. “There’s a lot that’s taken for granted that’s essential to what democracy is,” Coppedge said. “Instead, what we get our votes on [are] skirmishes on the periphery of what democracy means.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One more complication is that there is no single agreed-upon list of what are (or aren’t) issues of democracy. Never mind what the more-democratic position is on each issue. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-govern-winning-majority-threatens-democracy-77381725</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Bearing all of that in mind, I’ve built two different metrics to help us understand a legislator’s stance on democracy. First is a minimalist definition of democracy, limited to basic requirements like free and, in theory, fair elections and other measures that help safeguard democracy. Second is a more expansive definition, which contains everything in the first category, but also includes bills that expand civil liberties and who has political power. That way, we can see where politicians converge on these two metrics — and where they differ.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, the most bare-bones definition: “issues of <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/25/41/25418cbf-e680-4ec8-bede-b819587fb85d/structure_of_v-dem_v111.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electoral democracy</a>.” Included in this definition are the most basic requirements of any functioning democracy, like free elections and freedom of the press. And while most of these issues typically don’t come up for congressional votes, some did this year — most notably, the counting of electoral votes from Pennsylvania and Arizona in the 2020 election, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/6/22213979/congress-electoral-vote-count-pence-hawley-cruz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually a ceremonial event</a> that this year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/06/electoral-vote-update-congress-resumes-counting-after-pro-trump-rioters-invade-capitol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced objections from members of Congress</a> and coincided with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/electoral-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol</a>. Four other types of bills fall into this category: a bill that would have set up an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack;<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3233" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;H.R. 3233&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000524897/senate-republicans-block-plan-for-independent-commission-on-jan-6-capitol-riot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when that failed to pass the Senate</a>, a bill to create a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol;<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/503/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;House Res. 503&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a> a bill to increase the independence of government oversight of the executive branch;<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2662" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;H.R. 2662&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> and the second bill to impeach former President Donald Trump,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;House Res. 24&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a> as he was charged with inciting “an insurrection against the government of the United States.” We realize that bill was more political than the others in this category — and we did debate whether to include it — but ultimately we decided that being too political wasn’t a good reason for exclusion, especially as the bill did deal with a core democratic principle: the peaceful transfer of power in America’s elections. (For what it’s worth, including this vote did not meaningfully change the results.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">How politicians vote on these issues doesn’t just reflect the extent to which they back President Biden’s policies, which <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight tracks via its Biden Score metric</a>. Though party lines are important here, this stripped-down metric of democracy still shows substantial variation — particularly among Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We constructed our metric by taking the number of bills on which each politician supported the democratic position, divided by the total number of democracy bills they voted on. A present vote or abstention was treated as half a vote (that is, neither pro- nor anti-democratic), &lt;a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20151112_97-780_2008ca8ef8cc3fefe8088a36d9e020ec07463ada.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;except for the Speaker&lt;/a&gt;. To make sure the equal weighting of votes in this percentage metric wasn’t skewing results, we also conducted a slightly more sophisticated dimensionality-reduction technique called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;principal component analysis&lt;/a&gt;, but since those results were very similar to our more simple percentage-based metric, we’re sticking to the simpler metric for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> On the other hand, Democrats are mostly clustered together in the upper-right hand corner.</p>

Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Bill Cassidy, Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse. All five of them opposed the objections to counting electoral votes in both Pennsylvania and Arizona and supported the National Commission to investigate Jan. 6 — all three of the pro-democracy bills the Senate voted on in this category, even though they differ quite a bit in the extent to which they support Biden’s agenda. Similarly, in the House, Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Tom Reed, John Katko, Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney all voted largely in favor of the pro-democracy measures in front of the House, even though Cheney rarely votes with Biden otherwise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other end of the spectrum, you can see which representatives have voted against both Biden and the bare-bones pro-democracy measures Congress has taken up. For instance, Sens. Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, Tommy Tuberville, Roger Marshall and Cindy Hyde-Smith have all voted against the democratic position every single time, even though Hyde-Smith tends to vote with Biden markedly more than the others. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But this bare-bones metric is, of course, a fairly narrow definition of what it means to live in a democracy, which is why I created a second metric that also includes bills that try to create a more expansive and inclusive democracy. Using legislative scorecards from organizations like <a href="https://www.aclu.org/scorecard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the government watchdog group <a href="https://democracyscorecard.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Cause</a> and the nonprofit research organization <a href="https://justfacts.votesmart.org/bills/NA/1/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vote Smart</a>, I looked at all of the other bills that Congress brought to the floor this year that could also be considered key to a functioning democracy, in addition to the ones I’ve already mentioned.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Vote Smart, I used votes that fell in their “Constitution” and “Civil Liberties and Civil Rights” categories. For Common Cause, I included votes that will be included in their next Democracy Scorecard (which were supplied to me via email).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> Bills that fall into this second category include:</p>

&lt;p&gt;And aside from including more votes, the fuller metric was constructed exactly like the bare-bones metric above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a></li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, the overall picture doesn’t change <em>that</em> much when you look at this fuller set of bills — although partisan differences are somewhat starker. While the bare-bones metric had a few Republicans on par with Democrats, this is no longer the case: There are no Republicans who are more supportive than Democrats of the more expansive definition of democracy.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the Senate, it’s still Collins, Murkowski, Romney, Sasse, and Cassidy that lead Republicans on this metric — supporting almost all of the bills that fall in this second metric. The notable exception is the For the People Act, which no Senate Republican voted in favor of. Meanwhile, we saw more movement in the House, which voted on more “small-d” democratic bills and whose democracy score increasingly correlated with the Biden score. However, there were still some Republicans who supported a majority of these more expansive democratic positions, such as Fitzpatrick, Reed, Katko and Kinzinger, even though most of them vote with Biden less than half of the time. Cheney, however, fell on this more expansive metric in large part because she didn’t support legislation like a bill to prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, the For the People Act and the Washington, D.C. Admission Act.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this brings us to an important point. As this more expansive definition of democracy shows, many of these issues have become polarized by party. That can make it hard to disentangle anti-democratic politics from partisan politics, according to <a href="https://www.gretchenhelmke.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gretchen Helmke</a>, a professor at the University of Rochester and one of the founders of <a href="http://brightlinewatch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bright Line Watch</a>, a group of political scientists that monitors democracy and threats to it. H.R. 1, the For The People Act, is an instructive example: Democrats have pushed this bill as small-d democratic because it makes it easier for people to exercise their right to vote, but they also first <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/8/18253609/hr-1-pelosi-house-democrats-anti-corruption-mcconnell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced it in 2019 as a statement of what the party stood for</a>, when it had no chance of passing a Republican-controlled Senate and White House. So have Republicans voted against this bill as part of a stance against voting rights, or have they opposed it because they worry it delivers Democrats a sweeping legislative victory? There is no one answer here. In nearly every bill we looked at in the fuller metric, it was very hard to separate the politics from the policy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this metric is not based on a random subset of possible issues. Democrats, who currently control both houses of Congress, might be strategic in what they choose to move forward, political scientist <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jakegrumbach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Grumbach</a> noted. Grumbach, a professor of political science at the University of Washington and the author of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c682q88keqycp6s/grumbach_laboratories_of_democratic_backsliding.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent paper tracking the state of liberal democracy at the state level</a>, cautioned that Democrats might want to avoid difficult decisions for their members by introducing bills that could divide the party, leading them to keep bills off the floor on which the party doesn’t agree — <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111421" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a form of selection bias</a> that plagues <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/rollcall-vote-selection-implications-for-the-study-of-legislative-politics/FFAD60FB9CA9BBD54F02DE44A1FF0264" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all studies</a> of congressional voting behavior.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Joe Manchin, the most conservative Democratic senator, has a Biden score of 100 percent, meaning he votes with the president on every bill. This is &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not because he agrees with the rest of his party&lt;/a&gt; on everything, but because, in a 50-50 Senate, Manchin’s vote is crucial to any Democratic bill passing &amp;#8212; meaning that the Democratic leadership doesn’t even bring bills to the floor if he has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/06/joe-manchin-opposes-for-the-people-act-democrats-voting-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;signaled that he won’t support&lt;/a&gt; them. More generally, if a party has perfect information about its members’ preferences, it can &lt;a href="https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-my/wp-content/uploads/sites/349/2011/10/14093744/C_JOP2007.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;avoid losing a single congressional vote&lt;/a&gt;, since it will never bring votes to the floor on which it doesn’t have majority support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>10</sup></a> We should therefore be careful about drawing any conclusions about the liberal and illiberal tendencies of the elected officials in our sample.

<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, the core of democracy in the U.S. is not up for debate. “We’re fighting battles today over certain aspects of the democratic process, but not the core of it, for the most part,” Coppedge told me. But the fact that questions of democracy have become so clearly partisan is not good for the future of democracy. And given just how politically divided that fight has already become, it’s more important than ever to track how Congress votes on the matters of democracy that do make it to the floor.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">A lot has happened over the past month that had the potential to convince vaccine hesitant Americans to get the jab: More than 1,000 Americans are dying every day, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration fully approved one of the COVID-19 vaccines, and Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-republicans-have-changed-their-messaging-on-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-it-too-little-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been more emphatic</a> that everyone — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisanship-isnt-the-only-reason-why-so-many-americans-remain-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even their supporters</a> — needs to get vaccinated.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the effect has been mixed. Each month for the past four months, Morning Consult has asked Americans whether they’ve gotten the vaccine and, if not, whether they plan to. The most recent results show a notable dip in the number of vaccine-hesitant Americans — those who say they do not plan to get the vaccine, or are unsure if they ever will — in some hard-hit states, while others barely budged even as COVID-19 cases climbed and prominent Republicans promoted the vaccine during the same period when the poll was conducted (July 24 to August 23). Packed ICUs and Ron DeSantis speeches aren’t always enough to sway people who reject the vaccine. </p>

Now, the <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/453561-floridas-most-recent-covid-19-death-toll-continues-climbing-to-new-historic-worsts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average number of deaths per day</a> in the state is higher than at any other point of the ongoing pandemic. The day before Morning Consult’s most recent round of polling began, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/florida-covid-19-hospitalizations-jump-significantly-79024355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly promoted the vaccines</a>, saying that they are saving lives and <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2021/07/26/sellout-anti-vax-conservatives-come-for-desantis-1389008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended himself against pushback</a> from Republican anti-vaxxers who thought he was doing too much to tout the vaccine. Vaccination rates in the state did climb during this period: from early July to early August, <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/08/11/florida-vaccinations-climb-during-delta-surge-but-half-the-state-is-still-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of doses administered daily increased by 50 percent</a>, though they remain far below April’s peak. But according to the Morning Consult survey, from July to August the percentage of Floridians unsure if they wanted to receive the vaccine only decreased by 0.6 percentage points — less than the poll’s 1 percent margin of error. The number of vaccine refusers in the poll decreased by 1.2 percentage points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In South Carolina, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/south-carolina-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July and August also saw a cascade of new cases</a> that rival the state’s peak in January. Some state Republicans — <a href="https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/greenville/2021/08/19/greenville-gop-leader-pressley-stutts-dies-covid-19/5503881001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but not all</a> — have stressed vaccination. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has been promoting the vaccine <a href="https://www.abccolumbia.com/2020/12/21/senator-lindsey-graham-receives-covid-19-vaccine-over-the-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since he received his first dose</a> last year, doubling his efforts after he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-1ead5c0885acc7f3b2b648abc4c550f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested positive</a> for a breakthrough case in August. But vaccination rates increased only modestly here, <a href="https://www.wspa.com/news/top-stories/scs-vaccination-rate-increases-as-covid-cases-continue-to-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from a seven-day moving average of around 3,000 doses per day</a> at the start of July to 5,206 at the start of August. And like other southern states, South Carolina barely saw a change among vaccine-hesitant residents between July and August polls. The percent of South Carolinians who said they did not plan to get the vaccine dropped from 22.9 percent to 21.6 percent, while those who were unsure was essentially unchanged at 12.6 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, not all states with the highest COVID-19 rates are run entirely by the GOP. In Kentucky, where Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/02/1023925050/kentucky-governor-encourages-mask-use-and-vaccinations-as-delta-variant-spreads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has promoted vaccines and mask-wearing</a>, there also has been hardly any change in uncertainty and refusal rates over the last month despite <a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2021/08/13/wkyt-interactive-kentucky-sees-increase-vaccination-rates-covid-19-cases-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased vaccination rates</a> in some of the state’s counties that were previously lagging. In fact, from July to August, the number of vaccine refusers in the state essentially stayed the same. And more or less the same number of people in the state are unsure whether they want the vaccine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, some states registered more of a change, although significant pockets of resistance remain. Mississippi, which has one of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninashapiro/2021/07/10/mississippi-has-the-lowest-covid-19-vaccination-rate-but-the-highest-childhood-vaccination-rate-heres-why/?sh=1e59a92e19ab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country</a>, saw <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/19/mississippi-covid-worst-pandemic-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a record-breaking wave</a> of new cases in August. Some Republicans here, too, <a href="https://www.sunherald.com/news/coronavirus/article253469849.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began publicly touting</a> the vaccine over the last few weeks, such as state Sen. Jeremy England. England <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JeremyEnglandSenate/posts/1151559061999132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got his first dose of the vaccine in August</a>, and made several lengthy social media posts promoting the vaccine, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JeremyEnglandSenate/posts/1156677828153922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing that</a> “The verdict is out. The vaccine works.” Vaccination rates <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-mississippi-e6fabd2e331d8bf29efd623598b75929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticked up slightly</a> in July, and have remained steady since. Mississippi also saw a notable drop in the number of people who say they refuse to get the vaccine: 30 percent of Mississipians said they don’t plan to get the shot in the July poll, while 26 percent said so in the most recent poll. But that drop of 4 percentage points still means that more than one-quarter of the population is unwilling to get the jab. Meanwhile, the number of unsure Mississippians dropped less than 1 percentage point in the last month. The state’s Republican governor, Tate Reeves, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mississippi-governor-belief-eternal-life-reduces-fear-of-covid-19-2021-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Saturday</a> that people in his state were “less scared” of the virus because they believe in “eternal life.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Louisiana also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country and saw a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-sees-highest-spike-single-day-covid-hospitalizations-start-pandemic-n1275282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spike in single-day hospitalizations</a> in July. That month, Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards said the rise in cases and hospitalizations in the state was “scary” and <a href="https://twitter.com/LouisianaGov/status/1420076947799957516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly pushed residents</a> to get vaccinated. On top of that, Louisiana representative and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said that he had “<a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/national/coronavirus/republicans-amp-up-calls-for-americans-to-get-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high confidence</a>” in the vaccine — four days after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-republicans-have-changed-their-messaging-on-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-it-too-little-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he received the jab himself</a>. From then to now, however, there’s only been a “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccinations-states-infection-rates-d877547c26b0b3982c0d802339cd5219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little bump</a>” in vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy and refusal rates, however, have declined by a few percentage points: the number of people who said they wouldn’t get the vaccine dropped 4.3 percentage points over the last month, while the number of people who say they’re unsure if they want the jab dropped 0.6 percentage points. It’s possible that conditions in the state will worsen after Hurricane Ida ripped through Louisiana over the weekend. Edwards told the Associated Press on Sunday that over <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-ida-hospitals-5f68dc3f11842ad3b2effbc5d202ffb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,400 COVID-19 patients were in Louisiana hospitals</a>, many of which are grappling with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/hurricane-ida-live-updates-n1277879/ncrd1277940#liveBlogHeader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power outages</a> and <a href="https://www.wwltv.com/article/weather/ochsner-medical-center-hurricane-ida/289-f4ebe2ec-3eb9-4b23-ba35-d088d9ce0396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infrastructure damage</a> after the storm. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this again shows how getting vaccinated has become less of a public health issue and more of an identity and political one — if statements of support for vaccinations among political heavyweights in either party is moving the needle at all, it is doing so inconsistently. It seems there’s a certain bedrock of anti-vaccine Americans for whom no amount of new cases or political statements is convincing, and the rest of the public is left grappling with the consequences.</p>]]></description>

			<title>What Drove 9 Moderate House Democrats To Hold Up Their Party’s Agenda?</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">With Democrats clinging to just an <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight-seat majority</a> in the House of Representatives, even a small number of defectors can hold up the party’s legislative agenda. That reality was on vivid display last week, when nine moderate Democrats <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-c2c1cfd80e7850d32d3387a9e1c05087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened to vote no</a> on moving forward with Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget resolution unless the House first voted to pass the Senate’s bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure package.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi eventually <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-08-24/house-senate-infrastructure-bill-moderates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck a deal with the bloc</a>, and the budget resolution passed on a party-line vote, but this will probably not be the last we hear of the “Moderate Nine.” So let’s get to know these fairly anonymous members of Congress a little bit better by exploring three key questions. First, do they have a long track record of moderation, or did their objection to the budget come as a surprise? Second, are they tacking toward the center for electoral reasons, or are they acting out of principle? And finally, might any of them be vulnerable to progressive primary challenges in 2022?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First of all, these were the members of Congress you would by and large expect to balk at ambitious progressive legislation. Eight of the nine are members of the <a href="https://bluedogcaucus-costa.house.gov/members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Dog Coalition</a>, a caucus of centrist Democrats. And they mostly have moderate voting records, too. According to the first dimension of <a href="https://voteview.com/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DW-Nominate</a>, which uses voting records to quantify the ideology of every member of Congress on a scale from 1 (most conservative) to -1 (most liberal), seven of the nine have ideology scores of -0.254 or closer to zero. That places them among the top 32 most conservative Democrats in the House. In fact, one of them — Rep. Jared Golden — is the single most conservative Democrat in the House according to DW-Nominate, with a score of -0.112. And Rep. Josh Gottheimer, the Moderate Nine’s unofficial ringleader, is the third-most conservative, with a score of -0.147.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps surprisingly, though, most of the Moderate Nine vote in line with President Biden’s position all or almost all of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden Score</a>. Five of them have voted with Biden 100 percent of the time, and three more have voted with him 97 percent of the time. Of course, this doesn’t reflect the headaches these members may cause behind the scenes for Biden and Pelosi — but it does reflect how they almost always vote with their party in the end, as they did on the budget resolution. (The fact that only eight House Democrats have Biden Scores below 97 percent also reflects how remarkably cohesive the Democratic caucus has been so far this Congress.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Golden is once again the outlier here, voting with Biden only 81 percent of the time — the lowest score not only among the Moderate Nine, but also among all House Democrats. This may partially be because Golden has strong electoral incentives to be a centrist: His Maine 2nd District has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> of R+11, making it the most Republican-leaning district in the nation currently represented by a Democrat.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/bidens-approval-rating-fallen-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79388894</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, Golden is not the only Democrat representing inhospitable terrain. Several other members of the Moderate Nine also occupy competitive seats, including Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (R+4), Gottheimer (EVEN), Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D+2) and Rep. Kurt Schrader (D+4). So it’s likely that their objection to the budget was at least partially an attempt to burnish their moderate credentials for swing voters as well.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of their congressional districts will be redrawn in the next year as part of the &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;decennial redistricting process&lt;/a&gt;, but none of them should count on getting a free ride to reelection in 2022 regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>12</sup></a> This may be especially true of Gonzalez, who stands apart from the rest of the Moderate Nine with his -0.382 DW-Nominate score — smack dab in the middle of the Democratic caucus. Prior to 2020, Gonzalez’s Texas 15th District had been safely Democratic turf, but Biden surprisingly carried it by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-2020-2016-and-2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 2 percentage points</a>, and Gonzalez himself eked out only a <a href="https://results.texas-election.com/races" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-point win</a>. As a result, Gonzalez may have felt the need to adopt more moderate stances. Indeed, a Congress-by-Congress version of DW-Nominate finds that Gonzalez’s voting record has not been nearly as liberal here in 2021 as it was in 2019-20.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Electoral considerations don’t appear to be motivating the moderation of Reps. Ed Case, Jim Costa and Filemon Vela, however. Case and Costa both represent solidly Democratic districts, with partisan leans of D+32 and D+17, respectively; in other words, these two representatives could be much more progressive and still be in no danger of losing a general election. And while Vela’s Texas 34th District is, like Gonzalez’s, newly competitive (D+5), Vela announced back in March that he <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/03/22/filemon-vela-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not run for reelection</a>. So it seems likely that these three representatives genuinely believe in more of a centrist approach to governing. You might put Rep. Henry Cuellar in the same category, too: Although he’s running for reelection in a swing seat (D+4), his district (like Vela’s and Gonzalez’s) also zoomed to the right in the 2020 election. And Cuellar was known as <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/09/11/democrat-henry-cuellar-fundraising-republican-john-carter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most conservative Democrats in the House</a> even when his district was safely blue.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But regardless of their motivations, the Moderate Nine have drawn plenty of flak from their fellow Democrats; a coalition of progressive groups has even <a href="https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/568981-progressive-groups-target-moderate-dems-over-effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent six figures</a> on an ad campaign attacking them over their holdup of the budget. And while it’s still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rare for an incumbent to lose renomination</a>, some data suggests that some members of the Moderate Nine may be vulnerable to primary challenges if progressives decide to press their case. As occupants of safe blue seats, Case and Costa would seem like natural targets. In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders won <a href="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/CA-D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">41 percent of the vote</a> in Costa’s district in the 2020 presidential primary, and Costa himself won just <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2020-primary/sov/126-us-rep-congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58 percent of the votes cast for Democratic candidates</a> in the March 2020 top-two primary for his seat, suggesting his district has a not-insignificant appetite for more progressive politicians. For his part, Case was <a href="https://files.hawaii.gov/elections/files/results/2020/primary/histatewide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unopposed</a> in his 2020 primary, but he won only a <a href="https://files.hawaii.gov/elections/files/results/2018/primary/histatewide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent plurality</a> in the crowded 2018 primary, when his Hawaii 1st District was an open seat. And Case has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2HI02128/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than $100,000</a> for his 2022 reelection campaign so far.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cuellar is another prime candidate to lose his primary next year; in 2020, progressive attorney Jessica Cisneros held Cuellar to just a <a href="https://www.tpr.org/news/2020-03-04/henry-cuellar-narrowly-defeats-jessica-cisneros-in-tx-28-democratic-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent to 48 percent primary win</a>, and Cisneros has already announced she will <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/05/jessica-cisneros-henry-cuellar-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run again in 2022</a>. Bourdeaux might also be in for a tough fight: It’s a <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2021/05/04/ga-house-members-could-be-on-hot-seat-in-congressional-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distinct possibility</a> that the Republicans in charge of redistricting in her home state of Georgia will draw her and neighboring Rep. Lucy McBath together into a single safe blue district (in effort to reclaim a seat for themselves). Although Bourdeaux has already raised a hefty <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8GA07201/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> for 2022, McBath has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8GA06393/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more</a>. Bourdeaux is also a first-term representative who won her 2020 primary with only <a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/103613/web.255599/#/detail/30720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53 percent</a> of the vote, so she may not have had time yet to build up loyalty among local powerbrokers and voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are fewer signs, though, that the other four non-retiring moderates might be vulnerable in a primary. For instance, Gottheimer defeated progressive Arati Kreibich <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/assets/pdf/election-results/2020/2020-official-primary-results-us-house-amended-0826.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66 percent to 34 percent</a> in his 2020 primary, and he won’t be easy to take down next year either: One of the most prodigious fundraisers in Congress, Gottheimer took in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6NJ05171/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.9 million</a> in the first six months of 2021 and currently has more than $10 million in his campaign war chest. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the $3.5 trillion budget is hardly the last fight we can expect over the Democratic agenda in Congress this year, and with their success at getting Democratic leadership to negotiate with them, we can probably expect the Moderate Nine — and other representatives who fit these criteria — to continue to try to block (or at least influence) future legislation. Some may be acting with the intention of building credibility with swing voters, but their actions are not without risk as well: The more centrist notoriety they gain, the more likely they will be targeted in a Democratic primary. And of course, if Biden and the Democratic Congress are perceived as ineffective at governing, general-election voters might not distinguish between individual Democrats when they punish the party in November 2022.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In the past few weeks, President Biden’s job approval rating has dropped precipitously while his disapproval rating has risen sharply <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/biden-s-job-ratings-decline-amid-covid-surge-afghanistan-withdrawal-n1277368" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amid concerns</a> surrounding the delta variant of the coronavirus, the associated economic fallout from the pandemic and the ongoing withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just how much have things changed for Biden? A month ago, his approval rating stood at 52.7 percent and his disapproval rating sat at 42.7 percent, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>, for a net approval rating of +10.0 percentage points. But as of Thursday,<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> his approval rating stood at 47.1 percent and his disapproval rating at 47.0 percent, for a net approval rating of +0.1 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In an era of deep political polarization where <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-should-still-pay-attention-to-joe-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we rarely see big shifts</a> in public opinion of presidents, this counts as a pretty big swing.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="920" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/biden-approval-rating-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/biden-approval-rating-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/biden-approval-rating-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/biden-approval-rating-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">There seem to be two separate events driving this rapid decline. First, Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell 2.5 points from July 26 to Aug. 5</a> as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the delta variant surged</a>. This slide is reflected in Biden’s overall handling of COVID-19, too. His <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating on that issue</a> fell about 3 points, from about 60 percent to 57 percent, after hovering in the low 60s for much of his presidency. And it’s continued to tick down from there:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1306" height="648" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-26-at-2.11.36-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-26-at-2.11.36-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-26-at-2.11.36-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-26-at-2.11.36-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Then <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things fell apart in Afghanistan</a> just weeks before the last remaining U.S. troops were scheduled to leave the country. On Aug. 15, the U.S.-backed government completed its collapse and the Taliban fully returned to power after being pushed out by U.S.-led military forces in 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Initially, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/04/21/afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans overwhelmingly supported</a> Biden’s decision in April to withdraw the remaining U.S. military forces from the country. Even now, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/politics/polls-afghanistan-biden/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are more in favor of leaving than staying</a>, but most Americans think Biden has handled the withdrawal poorly. Last weekend, a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-troop-removal-biden-approval-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov survey</a> found that about 3 in 4 Americans felt the withdrawal was going “very” or “somewhat badly,” while a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/24/afghanistan-woes-sink-bidens-approval-41-usa-today-suffolk-poll/8244854002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today/Suffolk University poll</a> released on Tuesday found that 62 percent disapproved of how the Biden administration has handled the withdrawal. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear whether the circumstances in Afghanistan are entirely responsible for the roughly 3-point decline in Biden’s approval rating since Aug. 5, given the continued prevalence of the delta variant in the U.S. Moreover, as I wrote <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier in August</a>, some of Biden’s dip in approval could be related to growing economic concerns and a souring among some independent voters. That said, there’s no question that at least part of Biden’s decline in approval has been fueled by what’s happened in Afghanistan. And it could fall even more. A pair of suicide bombers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/26/world/afghanistan-taliban-biden-news?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed at least 60 Afghans and 12 American troops</a> outside the Kabul airport yesterday, an attack that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/isis-claims-responsibility-explosions-kabuls-airport-agenda/story?id=79661533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISIS-K claimed responsibility for</a> and which could further sour American public opinion on Biden’s handling of the withdrawal.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/bidens-approval-rating-fallen-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79388894</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">As such, Biden’s approval rating might not bounce back just yet given how volatile the situation is in Afghanistan, but at the same time there is reason to believe it eventually will. That’s because polls conducted amid a high-profile event often show large shifts in opinion that then fade over time. We’ve also seen some reversion to the mean for recent presidents’ approval ratings after their ratings fell. Early in his presidency, Donald Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-james-comey-fired/story?id=47309009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired then-FBI Director James Comey</a> amid ongoing investigations of his administration for Russian interference in the 2016 election and then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed classified intel to Russian officials</a> in a meeting at the White House the next day. In the aftermath of these events, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s approval rating fell</a> from about 42 percent on May 9 to 38 percent in early June. But his approval rating then inched back up to around 40 percent later that month.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a postscript, despite his reputation as being impervious to scandal, Trump often experienced brief blips in his approval rating. His approval rating would fall for a brief period below 40 percent then bounce back up. But by May 2019, his approval rating &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mostly settled&lt;/a&gt; just above or below 42 percent for the next year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, though, Biden’s approval rating might fall a bit further before it reverts to any sort of mean. This is in part because the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-pressure-g7-leader-extend-afghanistan-withdrawal-deadline/story?id=79617715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final withdrawal of American troops is set for next week,</a> and that could go awry given how precarious the situation is in Afghanistan. Moreover, the delta variant and corresponding economic concerns aren’t <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/08/24/covid-vaccine-efficacy-delta-variant-cdc-study-los-angeles/5578703001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessarily going away anytime soon</a>. An early August survey <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354026/satisfaction-drops-covid-resurges-top-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Gallup found</a> that just 23 percent of Americans were satisfied with the way things were going in the United States, down from 36 percent in May. Meanwhile, Gallup also found that Americans once again view COVID-19 as the country’s most important problem after concerns had dipped in the spring and early summer. And as our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential approval tracker of Biden’s response to the coronavirus</a> shows, just 53 percent of Americans now approve of his handling of the pandemic. What happens next in Afghanistan will be important for Biden’s approval rating, but equally important is whether Biden is able to navigate the other challenges facing him.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Two new surveys from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/parents-school-covid-19-opinion-poll/">CBS News/YouGov</a> and <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/support-for-mask-and-vaccine-mandates-in-schools/">Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> found that about 6 in 10 respondents thought in-person students should be required to wear masks. CBS News/YouGov polled parents of school-age kids and found that 58 percent felt masks should be required for students, while 36 percent said they should be optional (6 percent said they shouldn’t be allowed). Meanwhile, AP/NORC polled all adults and found that 58 percent strongly or somewhat favored mask-wearing for children. Both polls found predictable partisan divides on the issue, with more than 8 in 10 Democrats agreeing masks should be required or favoring mask-wearing, while only around 3 in 10 Republicans felt the same.</li><li>Vaccinated Americans <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-booster">may soon need a booster shot</a> to combat COVID-19, and a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/25/covid-booster-shot-poll/">Morning Consult survey</a> found that 77 percent of vaccinated adults said they would get a booster if it were recommended, while 12 percent said they were unsure and 5 percent were opposed. An additional 6 percent said they’d already gotten a booster shot, which has been encouraged for people with compromised immune systems or organ transplant recipients. The survey was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0818-covid-19-booster-shots.html">conducted right around the time</a> the Biden administration announced that booster shots would be recommended.</li><li>Speaking of parents, they believe it’s harder to be a parent now than 20 years ago, according to a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/majority-parents-say-it-harder-be-parent-now-compared-20-years-ago">new survey by Ipsos</a>. Overall, 69 percent of parents felt this way, with more mothers (72 percent) than fathers (65 percent) agreeing with that sentiment. This split may have something to do with the fact that 87 percent of women with children under 18 said in the same survey that they were “responsible for the majority of childcare and decision-making in the household,” compared with 69 percent of men. Overall, though, 88 percent of parents agreed that it was more expensive to be a parent now than 20 years ago.</li><li>More than eight months after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/attitudes-jan-6-capitol-attack-settle-along-familiar-partisan-lines-n1277534">NBC News found</a> that attitudes toward the attack have settled along somewhat typical partisan lines. According to the poll, 59 percent of Americans agreed it was an attempt to overturn the election versus 38 percent who disagreed, with 89 percent of Democrats agreeing compared with just 32 percent of Republicans (56 percent of independents also agreed). Meanwhile, 46 percent of Americans agreed that the incident had been exaggerated to discredit Trump versus 50 percent who disagreed, with 82 percent of Republicans agreeing compared with only 12 percent of Democrats (43 percent of independents also agreed).</li><li>After <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/8/18/22631299/mike-richards-jeopardy-host-search-process-past-comments">allegations</a> broke last week that “Jeopardy!” executive producer Mike Richards had used sexist and demeaning language, Richards quickly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/business/mike-richards-quits-jeopardy.html">stepped down</a> as the next host of the TV quiz show. In a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/24/jeopardy-post-richards-poll-burton/">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted after Richards had bowed out, 17 percent of the show’s viewers said they wanted actor and longtime “Reading Rainbow” TV host LeVar Burton to be the next permanent host, the most of any candidates named. Former “Jeopardy!” contestant Ken Jennings was second at 14 percent, followed by actor and neuroscientist Mayim Bialik at 12 percent, with the remaining contenders all at 8 percent or lower. Bialik was already in line to host special editions of the show, but following Richards’s exit, she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/media/mayim-bialik-jeopardy/index.html">took over temporary hosting duties</a>.</li></ul><p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-ending-war-afghanistan-79488089</p>

			<title>Why Candidates With Little Hope Of Winning Are Raising More Money Than Ever</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">If you had to guess which House candidate has raised the most money so far, you might guess that person was a well-heeled incumbent or someone running in a competitive district. After all, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/incumbent-advantage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incumbents usually have a lot of cash on hand</a> and <a href="http://goodliffe.byu.edu/papers/primgen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive races tend to attract more money</a> because they are more likely to determine which party wins power.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, among non-incumbent candidates running for the House in 2022, the top fundraiser is a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/democratic-veteran-challenges-twisted-qanon-promoting-greene/2JF4KV2RPBH6XETYMVWLOODFXA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrat with no political experience running in a deep-red seat</a>: Democrat Marcus Flowers <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/GA/14/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised over $2 million</a> (as of June 30) in his bid to unseat controversial Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, which is a whopping 55 percentage points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric</a>.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Flowers’s windfall might seem strange given the long odds he — or any Democrat — faces in defeating Greene, but it also reflects a growing trend wherein candidates with little hope of winning still achieve eye-popping fundraising hauls. Based on political science research and an analysis of congressional fundraising, it’s clear that these candidates are the beneficiaries of two larger trends in American politics: a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong antipathy for the opposing party</a> and the ease with which someone can now <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-actblue-is-trying-to-turn-small-donations-into-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donate to a campaign</a> on <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/08/actblue-outraises-winred-gop-catching-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the internet</a>. And together, these forces can help long-shot candidates bring in huge sums — whether they are no-name candidates or well-qualified contenders.</p>



<h2><strong>Long odds, but lots of cash</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, long-shot candidates showed just how much they could fundraise by running against a loathed opponent and/or by going viral online. For instance, despite never having held elected office or run in a high-profile campaign, six Republican challengers raised at least $2 million in House races they then lost by anywhere from 20 to 45 points. Raising <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/national/2020/12/lacy-johnson-had-almost-no-chance-of-defeating-rep-ilhan-omar-he-still-raised-more-money-than-any-other-congressional-candidate-in-minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly from individual donors</a>, Republican challenger Lacy Johnson <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MN/05/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought in the most</a>, $12.2 million, running against Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar. Other Republican challengers raised large sums as well: <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/21/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Cummings raised $11.2 million</a> against New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/43/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Collins raised $10.6 million</a> against California Rep. Maxine Waters, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MD/07/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Klacik raised $8.3 million</a> against Maryland Rep. Kweisi Mfume,<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wypr.org/wypr-news/2020-04-28/democrat-kweisi-mfume-wins-race-to-replace-the-late-elijah-cummings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Klacik first ran in a special election&lt;/a&gt; against Mfume in April 2020, to succeed the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. Mfume won that race, but Klacik was also the GOP nominee in that November’s general election against Mfume. Klacik &lt;a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MD/07/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raised $8.3 million for the entire cycle&lt;/a&gt;, with at least $8 million of her contributions coming &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the special election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/28/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Early raised $4.1 million</a> against California Rep. Adam Schiff and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/21/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Loomer raised $2.3 million</a> against Florida Rep. Lois Frankel. And as the chart below shows, those fundraising numbers are truly staggering for just how much they differed from those of Republican nominees in other very Democratic-leaning House seats.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In at least four of these races, negative partisanship seems to have been the main motivation for the gobs of money raised. As members of the so-called “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/17/20696474/squad-congresswomen-trump-pressley-aoc-omar-tlaib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squad</a>,” Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/ocasio-cortez-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile targets of derision</a> in conservative circles, while Waters is also <a href="https://www.axios.com/derek-chauvin-trial-maxine-waters-7f122d0b-6826-4c7d-b8ec-6288d31964a0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loathed</a> by conservatives and Schiff earned infamy among conservatives after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/22/politics/adam-schiff-senate-impeachment-trial-2020/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading Democrats’ impeachment efforts</a> in the House. Meanwhile, the other two campaigns seem to have hinged more on gaining traction online. Mfume, for instance, is not that well-known nationally, but Klacik’s <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/elections/bs-md-pol-klacik-fundraising-20201016-g4td5mmbkjhpdpgooywx4wtmgq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign still went viral</a> after then-President Donald Trump retweeted her campaign ad in August 2020; the ad showed her marching through a dilapidated area of Baltimore, and it helped her <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00726117/1515670/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise $6.5 million</a> from July through September that year — the largest haul in a single reporting period by any of these four candidates. Frankel also isn’t a high-profile Democrat, but Loomer was still able to bring in a sizable fundrasing haul thanks to her <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/laura-loomers-nonsensical-lawsuit-against-cair-killed-by-judge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large online presence</a> as a vocal promoter of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/19/21375159/laura-loomer-congress-republican-florida-trump-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim rhetoric</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These six long-shot Republican campaigns are outliers for the amount of money they raised. For comparison’s sake, these candidates raised a total of nearly $49 million, compared to a median fundraising haul of about $54,000 by GOP nominees in districts that were 15 points or more Democratic. But <a href="https://politicalscience.byu.edu/directory/jay-goodliffe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Goodliffe</a>, a political scientist at Brigham Young University <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/who-donates-in-campaigns/3F136D6FF1AEDBECB6D34CAF2C4C8083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who studies campaign donors</a>, told me that the environment to raise vast sums of money in noncompetitive races has only improved in recent years. For one thing, the internet has made it much simpler to send candidates money. And on top of that, many small donors now contribute as a way of expressing their political preferences, not because they are being strategic or expect to “get something” from their donation. “You're not expecting to affect the election with your $100 donation,” said Goodliffe. “You may not even be expecting to be able to call up that person and ask to have a meeting with them. You're just donating because you feel good about that.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And long-shot Republicans aren’t the only ones benefiting from this phenomenon. Although we saw more big hauls on the GOP side in 2020 House races, Democrat Phil Ehr <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8FL01107/?cycle=2020&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also brought in</a> $2 million to challenge Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, whose district was R+43. Gaetz, of course, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has attracted scorn from Democrats</a> given his vocal support for Trump, even before his recent scandal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over alleged sex trafficking</a>, but Ehr still lost by about 31 points. And as the 2022 election cycle ramps up, at least one Democrat -- the aforementioned Flowers -- <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/14/a-would-be-opponent-crashes-a-marjorie-taylor-greene-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has already launched a long-shot bid</a> fueled by disdain of the other party.</p>



<h2><strong>High-quality candidates can go to the bank, too</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The same forces at play with these lesser-known, long-shot House candidates also apply to higher-profile contenders with more <a href="http://ces.iga.ucdavis.edu/mwpsa99.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional markers of candidate quality</a>, such as past political service or elected experience. Arguably no recent candidate better exemplifies this than Democrat <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-a-candidate-in-kentucky-but-can-she-beat-mitch-mcconnell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy McGrath</a>, who challenged then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kenutcky in the state’s 2020 Senate race. McGrath had only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/kentucky-house-district-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly lost</a> her high-profile 2018 House race, and in her 2020 Senate bid, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0KY00339/?cycle=2020&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she raised $96.3 million</a> — more than <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/fundraising-totals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but six Senate contenders</a> from either party. But despite her credentials as a former fighter pilot and much-ballyhooed candidate in a competitive 2018 House race, McGrath still <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=21&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost by nearly 20 points</a> to McConnell in the deep-red state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/folly-just-throwing-money-political-candidates/617074/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rage-donating</a>” isn’t limited to just outlandish, viral candidates who don’t really stand a chance. It can also play a big role in high-profile and potentially competitive races like McGrath’s, as one reason she managed to bring in so much money is simple: <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/0v9p6tn6ur/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats <em>really</em> dislike McConnell</a>. “McConnell represents the Senate Republicans and perhaps the Republican Party,” said Goodliffe, and he told me that’s significant because a candidate’s opponent increasingly can be what motivates someone to contribute money to a campaign. Another example of this phenomenon in 2020 was contributions to the Senate campaign of Jaime Harrison, a former chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party. On the one hand, Harrison’s race against Sen. Lindsey Graham was more competitive than McGrath’s, so Democratic donors might have thought it was more strategic to donate to his campaign, but on the other hand, the incredible amount of money he brought in -- <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/SC/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$132.7 million</a> -- has to reflect, in part, just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/us/politics/jaime-harrison-lindsey-graham-south-carolina.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how infuriated Democrats were with Graham</a> given his support for Trump and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/us/politics/lindsey-graham-barrett-confirmation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the role he played in the Senate confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett</a> to the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/26/927640619/senate-confirms-amy-coney-barrett-to-the-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right before the election</a>. Harrison didn’t lose as badly as McGrath, but he still lost to Graham <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=45&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 10 points</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to the 2022 election, one parallel in this category of candidates is Democratic state Sen. Kerry Donovan’s 2022 <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2021/04/01/lauren-boebert-kerry-donovan-campaign-fundraising-2022-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House campaign</a> in Colorado against GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, who, like Greene, is also the <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2021/04/01/scoop-inside-dems-challenge-to-take-down-lauren-boebert-492324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject of much Democratic ire</a>. As a state legislator, Donovan checks the high-quality candidate box, as her current position <a href="https://www.stephenoconnell.org/files/McOC_LegislativeCareers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been one of the more successful paths</a> to winning a seat in the House. But unless <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a> produces a friendlier district than the current R+12 seat that Boebert occupies, it will be hard for Donovan to unseat Boebert. (Moreover, Colorado’s independent redistricting commission’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/preliminary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first map proposal actually made the district slightly redder</a>.) That said, given Boebert’s unpopularity among Democrats nationally, it’s not surprising that Donovan’s campaign has already attracted $1.2 million, making Donovan’s haul the third-highest total raised by a non-incumbent House candidate this cycle.</p>



<h2><strong>What this means for campaigns and candidates</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Making a fundraising splash is always a priority for campaigns, but these recent campaigns provide a roadmap for how even long-shot candidates can get there. Klacik and Flowers, for instance, produced an army of small-dollar donors despite the long-odds of their respective campaigns. Take Flowers: 90 percent of <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2GA14044/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the money he’s raised</a> has come from donors giving no more than $200. To put that in perspective, the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/large-vs-small-donations?cycle=2020&amp;type=M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest share of small-dollar donors for any House incumbent in 2020</a> was about 80 percent, which went to Ocasio-Cortez, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-viral-videos-20180718-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who went viral</a> in 2018 when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/nyregion/joseph-crowley-ocasio-cortez-democratic-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she first ran and defeated</a> Rep. Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent, in the Democratic primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s impossible to know when a long-shot candidate’s ad might hit a nerve or get a retweet from a president, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21244667/election-candidates-zoom-campaign-social-media-politicians-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the payoff can be huge</a>, which is one reason we might see more campaigns like this. “It’s so unpredictable, right?” said <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/about/staff.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheila Krumholz</a>, executive director of OpenSecrets, which monitors campaign finance data. “That's how it is in all walks of life now. Some kids and elderly persons and just somebody you would never have heard from otherwise has a TikTok video. Maybe they didn't even post it themselves, but suddenly it's just everywhere. The point is, we see this in politics, too.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, while we can’t know whether a certain long-shot candidate’s campaign will take off, the benefits of running and gaining national recognition might outweigh the very real downsides of likely losing, since a losing campaign can still be a stepping stone to future opportunities — either in elected office or in working around politics and media more generally. “Although you're losing on this initial one, it helps you build recognition, a fundraising network,” said Goodliffe. A good example of this is Harrison, who is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/22/959573611/dnc-chairman-jaime-harrison-wants-to-build-the-next-generation-of-democratic-tal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now chairman of the Democratic National Committee</a>. And even among the less credentialed GOP House challengers who raised more than $2 million in 2020, other opportunities have popped up. Klacik, for instance, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/klacik-gop-campaign-donations/2021/03/02/76300fde-7077-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has regularly appeared</a> on conservative media outlets and recently <a href="https://www.axios.com/maryland-republican-returns-consultants-trashed-317ebdcf-2148-4dd6-90bf-791e3661c379.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched her own political action committee</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These campaigns <a href="https://www.axios.com/republican-consultant-campaign-donations-89fd8660-68c9-4943-8ba6-8697263bfeb9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can also result</a> in consultants and vendors “making out like bandits,” Krumholz told me. For instance, in Johnson’s campaign against Omar, fundraising vendors working with the campaign <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/17/10164/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took in around $4 million</a> of the $12.2 million Johnson raised, in some cases by grabbing 70 to 80 cents of each dollar the firm raised. And in Klacik’s campaign, the firm hired to promote her viral video <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/klacik-gop-campaign-donations/2021/03/02/76300fde-7077-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended up being paid</a> $3.7 million of the $8.3 million she raised, by keeping 70 percent of the donations the video attracted. These sorts of high margins charged by campaign vendors <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/dc-fundraising-firm-takes-big-cut-of-contributions-701" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are nothing new</a>, but consultants stand to hit the jackpot if they’re working for a low-profile candidate who goes viral.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As such, experts I talked with told me we’re likely to see more — not fewer — little-known candidates try to break out and raise buckets of money in races where they attract tons of eyeballs or challenge a politician who their party despises. “When you lower the costs [of donating] and you have this negative partisanship going on, then you're going to find a lot more of these kinds of donations,” said Goodliffe.</p>

			<title>Why Some White Evangelical Republicans Are So Opposed To The COVID-19 Vaccine</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the race to get Americans vaccinated, two groups are commanding a lot of attention: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/why-so-many-republicans-wont-get-vaccinated/619659/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-08-10/white-evangelical-churches-and-the-crisis-of-vaccine-hesitancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white evangelicals</a>. Both are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/unvaccinated-america-in-5-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to have been vaccinated already and more likely to refuse</a> vaccination altogether.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s the overlap between white Republicans and white evangelicals that is especially telling, as white evangelical Republicans are among the most likely groups in the U.S. to refuse vaccination. According to a <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/religious-vaccines-covid-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June survey</a> by the Public Religion Research Institute, where I’m the research director, and the Interfaith Youth Core, white evangelical Republicans were considerably less likely to say they were vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated as soon as possible (53 percent) than Republicans who were not white evangelicals (62 percent). Moreover, white evangelical Republicans were the most likely of any large subgroup we surveyed to say they were refusing to get vaccinated (26 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That the combination of being a Republican and a white evangelical would form a particularly toxic anti-vax stew, more significant than party or religion alone, seems obvious to me, but then again, I grew up in rural Texas — I see this combination of beliefs in motion every day on Facebook, where I’m connected to many high school and college classmates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRRI’s 2020 religion census</a>, the county where I lived longest as a kid (Leon) is 72 percent white Christian, including 44 percent white evangelical, and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election data shows</a> 87 percent of the county voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020. <a href="https://tabexternal.dshs.texas.gov/t/THD/views/COVID-19VaccineinTexasDashboard/Summary?%3Aembed=y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just over one-third</a> of the county’s eligible population is fully vaccinated, even though COVID-19 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/leon-texas-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case rates are higher than they have ever been</a>. At least three people who went to high school with me have died, while tracking statistics say at least 1 in 9 Leon County residents have been ill — almost as many as in New York City (1 in 8), one of the hardest-hit areas in the country, and well over the rate in Washington, D.C. (1 in 13), where I live now.</p>

					</aside><p data-paragraph="main">This is significant because Leon County is extremely rural, with <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/leoncountytexas/PST045219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 20,000 total residents</a>, including less than 2,000 in Buffalo, the town I lived near. For reference, <a href="https://www.publicschoolreview.com/buffalo-high-school-profile/75831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my high school</a> has only about 260 students at any given time. If you need ICU treatment, you have to travel — there are currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/leon-texas-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no hospitals with ICUs</a> in the county. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what is also significant about Leon County is the role religion has played in residents’ low vaccination rates even when faced with death from the coronavirus. When my classmates were hospitalized with COVID-19, there were repeated calls for prayers and proclamations that God would provide healing. When they died, those prayer requests became comments that “God called [them] home.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The belief that God controls everything that happens in the world is a core tenet of evangelicalism — 84 percent of white evangelicals agreed with this statement <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2011/march/polling-evangelicals-god-causes-disasters-us-should-help.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in PRRI polling</a> from 2011, while far fewer nonwhite, non-evangelical Christians shared this belief. The same poll also showed that white evangelicals were more likely than any other Christian group to believe that God would punish nations for the sins of some of its citizens and that <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/few-americans-see-earthquakes-floods-and-other-natural-disasters-a-sign-from-god-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural disasters were a sign from God</a>. What’s more, other research from the Journal of Psychology and Theology has found that some evangelical Christians <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0091647118807187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rationalize illnesses like cancer</a> as God’s will. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is why I remember friends and acquaintances in Leon County when I think about how religious beliefs influence one’s attitude toward COVID-19 and vaccination. PRRI’s <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/prri-ifyc-covid-vaccine-religion-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March survey</a> found that 28 percent of white evangelical Republicans agreed that “God always rewards those who have faith with good health and will protect them from being infected with COVID-19,” compared with 23 percent of Republicans who were not white evangelicals. And that belief correlates more closely with vaccination views among white evangelical Republicans — 44 percent of those who said God would protect them from the virus also said they would refuse to get vaccinated. That number drops to 32 percent among Republicans who are not white evangelicals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Complicating matters further, the pandemic also fits neatly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-apocalypse-religion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into “end times” thinking</a> — the belief that the end of the world and God’s ultimate judgment is coming soon. In fact, nearly two-thirds of white evangelical Republicans (64 percent) from our March survey agreed that the chaos in the country today meant the “end times” were near. Faced, then, with the belief that death and the end of the world are <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-heaven-97670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fulfillment of God’s will</a>, it becomes difficult to convince these believers that vaccines are necessary. Sixty-nine percent of white evangelical Republicans who said they refused to get vaccinated agreed that the end times were near. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, given how many white evangelicals identify as Republican or lean Republican — about 4 in 5 per our June survey — disentangling evangelicals’ religious and political beliefs is nearly impossible. Consider how many white evangelical leaders like former Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. downplayed the severity of the pandemic <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-coronavirus-quarantine-rhetoric-fuels-dangerously-politicized-pandemic-ncna1170406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in line with Trump</a>. Falwell was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-evangelicals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardly the only evangelical leader</a> to do this either. If anything, the pattern of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/us/covid-vaccine-evangelicals/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white evangelical resistance</a> to vaccination has reached the point where some white evangelical leaders who might otherwise urge vaccination <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-religion-coronavirus-pandemic-7a03fed8e7548797487f2b7a20161e4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hesitate to do so</a> because of the political climate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the same survey, about 2 in 5 white evangelical Republicans (43 percent), and Republicans more broadly (41 percent), said one reason they hadn’t gotten vaccinated was that the COVID-19 pandemic had been overblown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that most white evangelical Republicans, and Republicans in general, disagreed with our question about the Golden Rule, that “because getting vaccinated against COVID-19 helps protect everyone, it is a way to live out the religious principle of loving my neighbors” (57 percent and 58 percent, respectively). This may be because for some white evangelicals and Republicans, politics and religion are inseparable — and God’s will, or their interpretation of it, controls everything.</p>

			<title>How Eric Adams Won The New York City Mayoral Primary</title>

			<category>Eric Adams</category>
			<category>NYC Mayoral Primary</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">For two months we’ve known that Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams won New York City’s Democratic primary for mayor with 31 percent of first-place votes (he finally achieved a majority in the ranked-choice election after <a href="https://vote.nyc/sites/default/files/pdf/election_results/2021/20210622Primary%20Election/rcv/DEM%20Mayor%20Citywide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight rounds</a> of instant runoffs). But for two months we haven’t known for sure exactly what his coalition looked like. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the wait is over: 57 days after the election, the New York City Board of Elections released <a href="https://vote.nyc/page/election-results-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precinct-level results</a> of the primary. And they show that Adams’s enigmatic politics found a broad coalition — but one that exists outside the city’s usual power centers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adams’s politics are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor-nyc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard to pigeonhole</a>. (For instance, the former police officer campaigned as the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/eric-adams-nyc-mayor-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-police candidate</a>, but he had previously been an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/nyregion/eric-adams-nyc-police-mayor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocate for reform</a> within the department.) But perhaps his one unifying characteristic is his anti-elitism, sometimes to the point of grievance. He campaigned first and foremost as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/26/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crusader for New York City’s large nonwhite working class</a>, using Manhattan’s ivory tower and its “fancy candidates” as a foil. When former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia and businessman Andrew Yang formed a last-minute alliance with the goal of stopping Adams, he <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/adams-campaign-calls-garcia-yang-alliance-voter-suppression-on-final-day-of-early-voting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equated it</a> to the suppression of Black and Hispanic voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It looks like that branding succeeded. Adams carried most of the city’s neighborhoods outside its cosmopolitan core. </p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The Adams coalition comes into especially sharp focus if you return to our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-5-political-boroughs-of-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“political boroughs” of New York City</a>, which FiveThirtyEight devised back in June based on the results of Democratic primaries in the city in 2016 and 2018. Going just off voters’ first choices, Adams won three of the five political boroughs, albeit with different levels of support. </p>

</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with Adams’s strongest political borough: the <strong>Black Bloc</strong>, a 63 percent non-Hispanic Black and 23 percent college-educated swath of Brooklyn and Queens. This was Adams’s <a href="https://www.brooklyn-usa.org/eric-adams-bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home turf</a> (he was born in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brownsville and grew up in the Queens neighborhood of South Jamaica), and unsurprisingly, he dominated here, winning 63 percent of first-place votes. Within the borough, he tended to do better in state Assembly districts with larger Black populations and lower median household incomes, although the correlation was stronger with race than with income.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R = 0.91 vs. R = -0.71.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adams also excelled in the Black neighborhoods of the <strong>Crossroads</strong>, a racially diverse political borough that covers zones of transition between the other four. He got at least 45 percent of first-place votes in each of three gentrifying but still majority-Black Assembly districts <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=56&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">east of</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Diana-C-Richardson/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn’s</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Rodneyse-Bichotte-Hermelyn/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospect Park</a>. But parts of the Crossroads with smaller Black populations were more Adams-skeptical, such as two <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=34&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Queens</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Catalina-Cruz/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">districts</a> where he received fewer than 20 percent of initial votes. Overall, his share of first-place votes in the Crossroads borough (37 percent) was fairly close to its Black population share (30 percent).</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/cuomo-resigning-now-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79389991</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But it wasn’t just in predominantly Black areas that Adams ran up the score. He was the first choice of 47 percent of voters in the <strong>True-Blue Bronx</strong>, which does have a sizable non-Hispanic Black population (29 percent) but is mostly Hispanic (57 percent). While there was still a strong correlation between Adams support and the Black population in this political borough (e.g., he performed the strongest in the heavily Black <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Carl-E-Heastie/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">northeast Bronx</a>), he must also have won significant numbers of Hispanic voters in districts like <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Jos%C3%A9-Rivera/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Belmont and Fordham Manor’s</a>, where the population is 73 percent Hispanic and 16 percent non-Hispanic Black but Adams got 42 percent of the vote. One potential reason: Like the Black Bloc, the True-Blue Bronx is heavily working class (18 percent of residents age 25 or older have at least a bachelor’s degree).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, New York City’s most conservative political borough, the <strong>Lands of Contradiction</strong>, is 46 percent non-Hispanic white, 26 percent Asian American, 19 percent Hispanic and only 5 percent non-Hispanic Black, but Adams still received 25 percent of first-place votes there. He was especially strong in plurality-white Assembly districts like <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Stacey-Pheffer-Amato/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard Beach’s</a> (40 percent) and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Steven-Cymbrowitz/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homecrest’s</a> (41 percent). However, Yang outran Adams in the political borough’s many plurality-Asian American neighborhoods (e.g., <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Ron-Kim/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flushing</a>), edging out Adams for first place in the Lands of Contradiction overall with 27 percent. Of note, both Yang (46 percent) and Adams (38 percent) excelled in the Assembly district that covers <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Simcha-Eichenstein/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borough Park and Midwood</a>, home of several conservative Orthodox Jewish communities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Adams finished third in the predominantly white, college-educated <strong>Elite Circles</strong>, with just 15 percent of first-place votes. Instead, the borough was split on whom it wanted to be mayor: 32 percent of voters there ranked Garcia first, while 27 percent opted for attorney Maya Wiley. But there was a clear difference between the areas that backed Garcia and the areas that backed Wiley. Garcia’s support was strongly correlated with median household income, and she topped 40 percent in each of the city’s five wealthiest Assembly districts — areas such as <a href="https://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/Dan-Quart/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midtown Manhattan</a>, the <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=067&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upper West</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Rebecca-A-Seawright/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Sides</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Jo-Anne-Simon/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downtown Brooklyn</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Wiley (the race’s premier progressive candidate) won younger, more racially diverse parts of the Elite Circles in Brooklyn and Queens — doing especially well (34 percent or more) in Assembly districts containing <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=57&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospect Heights</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Maritza-Davila/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williamsburg</a>, <a href="https://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/Emily-Gallagher/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=36&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astoria and Ditmars Steinway</a>. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that she also did well in gentrifying areas of the Crossroads, such as <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=56&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crown</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Diana-C-Richardson/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heights</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Inez-E-Dickens/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harlem</a>, where she may have paired the support of white progressives with some Black and Hispanic support. (Overall in the Crossroads, Wiley received 25 percent of first-place votes, almost as many as she got in the Elite Circles.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this means that Adams’s path to the nomination circumvented the city’s predominantly white power brokers and cultural trendsetters. Will Adams’s non-elite power base change what he attempts to do in office? On one hand, the outer boroughs and nonwhite New Yorkers may get more attention and appreciation from City Hall. On the other, Adams may struggle to establish productive relationships with the Manhattan-based media, corporations and an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/nyregion/new-york-city-council.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly progressive</a> New York City Council. (Such adversarial relationships crippled outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, and he assembled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/elections/2013/nyc-primary/mayor/map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty broad coalition</a> in his initial 2013 primary win.) If the 2021 campaign was any indication, it’s going to be an interesting next four years in New York City.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">With the release of block-level data from the 2020 census, we now have a much clearer picture of how and where the U.S. population has grown — and shrunk — over the past 10 years. And while Republicans are largely setting the terms of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting process</a> that will ensue from this announcement, the data throws a <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/redistricting/new-census-dataset-mostly-good-news-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-needed lifeline to Democrats</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not because of the country’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/census-shows-us-diversifying-white-population-shrinking-79423764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing racial diversity</a>, though. Sure, under <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current electoral coalitions</a> (where white voters are more likely to vote Republican and voters of color are more likely to vote Democratic), it’s arguably better for Democrats if the nonwhite population grows. But even in a country where only 58 percent of residents are non-Hispanic white, the 2020 presidential election was still very competitive. And electoral coalitions can change — for instance, Republicans may continue to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54972389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gain ground</a> among nonwhite voters in future elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, the good news for Democrats came in which parts of the country <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/8/17/2046167/-We-ve-got-census-growth-data-for-every-city-county-and-district-and-there-are-lots-of-surprises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained and lost population since the 2010 census</a>. Despite the country’s overall population increasing by 7.4 percent, rural areas — the reddest parts of the country — have steadily <em>lost</em> residents over the past 10 years. The average county with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight urbanization index</a> below 8<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index is a measure of how densely populated a county or county equivalent is based on the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of a given resident. The analysis in this article includes Washington, D.C., but excludes Alaska, which does not have county-equivalent-level election results available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> lost 3.1 percent of its population between 2010 and 2020. This encompasses the 1,430 most rural counties in America — 1,302 of which voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020, and only 127 of which voted for President Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, the fastest-growing parts of the country are the suburbs. The average county with an urbanization index between 11 and 13 (spanning from sparse suburban areas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_County,_Virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roanoke County, Virginia</a>, to dense suburban areas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_County,_New_Jersey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Union County, New Jersey</a>) grew by 9.6 percent between 2010 and 2020. Most of these counties (194 out of 264) voted for Biden, and if the trends of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 elections</a> continue, they will only get bluer.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-2020-census-good-news-democrats-nate-silver-79467274</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">America’s cities grew at a healthy rate too, which was something of a surprise compared with pre-census estimates. The 18 most urban counties or county equivalents in the country — those with a FiveThirtyEight urbanization index above 13 (including San Francisco, Philadelphia, four around Washington, D.C., and eight around New York City) — grew by an average of 8.4 percent — and all but one of them voted for Biden in 2020.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump-voting exception was Richmond County, New York, which is Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, the average county that voted for Biden boosted its population by 3.4 percent between 2010 and 2020, while the average Trump county grew by just 0.2 percent. Strikingly, 370 out of the 538 Biden counties (69 percent) gained population, while 1,468 out of the 2,574 Trump counties (57 percent) lost residents.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These population shifts are important because they will shape the nation’s political geography for the next 10 years, as congressional district lines will be drawn based on this data. As such, it will now be that much harder to draw congressional maps that favor Republicans: If a heavily Democratic metropolitan area is overflowing with people, map-drawers need to put them <em>somewhere</em> — which may necessitate creating an extra (blue) district for that city, or at least including more blue precincts in a neighboring Republican district than the GOP would like.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the other end of the spectrum, because congressional districts must have roughly equal populations, many depopulated rural congressional districts will need to expand — either cannibalizing a neighboring rural district (which could reduce the number of safely red seats) or encroaching on the outer suburbs. Because America’s exurbs are still fairly red (three-quarters of counties with a FiveThirtyEight urbanization index between 10 and 11 voted for Trump in 2020) this could reduce the number of Republicans living in a current swing district — a sort of redistricting domino effect.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">We can see how this domino effect might unfold by looking at which congressional districts, rather than counties, are over- and underpopulated. To see this, we can <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/8/16/2045702/-Morning-Digest-New-census-data-shows-which-districts-will-have-to-grow-or-shrink-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compare the 2020 population of each current district</a> to what its population should look like after the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reapportionment process</a>. (Remember, because each state’s districts must have the same population, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VsWXBX_cVFcfaxHdlAMzzhJYRWgayzWxsJ3rdOlO-24/edit#gid=1761243994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target population</a> of a state’s districts is the state’s 2020 population divided by the number of congressional districts it received in reapportionment.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the map below, orange districts will need to add population (i.e., they will need to expand), while purple ones will need to lose population (i.e., they will need to get smaller).</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Where congressional districts could shrink or grow" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lEddh/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="555" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The most obvious examples of districts that will need to expand are those in states that lost a seat in reapportionment, like West Virginia. But take a look at New York, which also lost a seat. The districts that will need to expand the most are all in upstate New York, while four New York City-based districts — the 5th, 8th, 10th and 12th — will actually need to <em>shed</em> residents. Since those districts are all extremely blue, that will provide mapmakers with an opportunity to add Democratic votes to nearby districts that might not be as safe, such as the 11th. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, in Illinois, the districts around Chicago are those that are already closest to their target post-redistricting population, whereas the downstate 12th and 17th will need to add the most people. And because Illinois also lost a seat in reapportionment, it’s most likely that downstate will lose representation. Since five of Illinois’s six current downstate representatives are Republicans (and Democrats control the map-drawing process in Illinois), that makes it a safe bet that Republicans will draw the short straw. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, patterns in population growth could blunt Republican gains as well. For example, the two most overpopulated current districts in North Carolina — which is gaining a seat — are the deep-blue 2nd (which covers Raleigh) and 12th (which covers Charlotte). Republicans are in charge of redistricting in North Carolina, but they would have to engage in some complicated gerrymandering gymnastics if they want to blunt the political power of these metro areas. Similarly, the Cook Political Report’s Dave Wasserman has <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/redistricting/new-census-dataset-mostly-good-news-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that explosive population growth in urban areas like Austin could limit Texas Republicans to a map where Republicans have the advantage in only 25 of the state’s now-38 districts, whereas previously they might have been able to draw 27 Republican-leaning seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, as Wasserman’s estimate makes clear, the population trends from the 2020 census are not enough to cancel out any gerrymandering efforts. Rather, the census numbers are merely a silver lining for Democrats. They still remain at a serious disadvantage in the 2021 redistricting cycle simply because Republicans will control the redrawing of more congressional districts. Republicans will have full control over the redrawing of 43 percent of congressional districts, and Democrats will have full control over the redrawing of just 17 percent. (Neither party enjoys full control of redistricting for 38 percent of districts, while the remaining 1 percent are at-large districts and won’t be redrawn at all.) </p>



<figure><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rakich-skelley.REAPPORTIONMENT.04TK.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rakich-skelley.REAPPORTIONMENT.04TK.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rakich-skelley.REAPPORTIONMENT.04TK.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rakich-skelley.REAPPORTIONMENT.04TK.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">So Democrats got some good news with the specific census data released earlier this month, but they are still in an unenviable position. As long as redistricting remains such a subjective process, who draws the maps will remain more important than the underlying data.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this month, right before senators departed for their summer recess, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-the-people-act-voting-rights-bill-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made an 11th-hour plea</a> to his colleagues to take up the omnibus voting rights bill, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For the People Act</a>. But Republicans once again <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/11/ted-cruz-voting-bill-congress-democrats-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped that from happening</a>. They also blocked two other provisions Schumer tried to put forward on voting rights — one bill that would have addressed partisan gerrymandering and another bill that tackled campaign finance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, Democrats know that Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-wont-support-sweeping-voting-rights-legislation-now-or-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are unlikely to support</a> sweeping voting rights legislation. After all, Republicans in the last few months have twice <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-wont-support-sweeping-voting-rights-legislation-now-or-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked consideration</a> of the For the People Act and have shown little appetite for negotiation, even scuttling West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/manchin-policy-demands-election-legislation-4b7454d5-eb83-4003-9044-81830add1d30.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compromise bill</a>. But that won’t stop Democrats from trying to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voting-rights-senate-adjourns/2021/08/11/f2e19620-fa3c-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take up voting legislation again</a> in September. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The text of this newest bill isn’t public yet, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/biden-democrats-voting-rights.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will reportedly be</a> a scaled-down version of the For the People Act and modeled after Manchin’s bill. It’s likely, though, that this bill will also fail. That’s in part because voting rights have become an intractable fight between the two parties: Democratic and Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/22/republicans-and-democrats-move-further-apart-in-views-of-voting-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view voting access fundamentally differently</a>. Polls do suggest that there is at least some appetite among Americans to make <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_062121/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain aspects of voting easier</a>, but whether Democrats can use that to their advantage and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/biden-democrats-voting-rights.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a moral argument</a> in favor of the government working to uphold democratic values, like voting rights, remains an open question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also a risky strategy for Democrats because there is no fail-safe plan if they fail to win over their Republican colleagues on this new bill. One final option might be to modify <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/14/biden-must-make-case-ending-filibuster-protect-voting-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or eliminate the filibuster</a>, but that, too, is a tall task for Democrats. That’s because while a majority of Democratic senators <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/filibuster-vote-count/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are in favor</a> of changes to the filibuster to pass something on voting rights, not all members are. Notably, Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/07/manchin-sinema-fillibuster-horror-film.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staunchly opposed</a> to eliminating the filibuster and also hesitant to make any tweaks to it. Manchin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/joe-manchin-filibuster-stimulus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at one point</a> said he was open to a so-called “talking filibuster,” where senators wanting to block legislation would have to speak continuously on the Senate floor in order to maintain a filibuster, but it’s unclear whether that change would be taken up. More tellingly, Manchin <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1372223248415481862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> several ideas floated by proponents of filibuster reform in March. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just Democratic holdouts in the Senate. Polls also show that Americans are largely opposed to abolishing the filibuster outright. According to <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_042921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an April Monmouth University poll</a>, just 19 percent of U.S. adults said Congress should get rid of the filibuster entirely versus 38 percent who said Congress should keep it as is. Voters were open to tweaks, with 38 percent of respondents telling Monmouth they were open to keeping but reforming the filibuster. Similarly, when a group of voters in <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/06/09/senate-filibuster-popularity-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult’s June survey</a> were given a choice between passing legislation with a simple majority or with a 60-vote threshold, 45 percent favored tweaking the filibuster to a simple majority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s troubling for Democrats is that those attitudes on filibuster reform barely shifted when respondents were asked about voting rights specifically, despite the fact that the filibuster has long been used to <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block civil rights legislation</a>. That April Monmouth poll found, for instance, that Americans were evenly split on amending the filibuster specifically for voting legislation: Forty-six percent of respondents said they supported<em> </em>using the filibuster to block federal bills on election rules and voting rights, while another 46 percent said they were opposed. Another <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/25/22347322/filibuster-voting-rights-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vox/Data for Progress</a> poll found pretty much the same thing: Fifty-two percent of likely voters either strongly or somewhat supported a change in Senate rules to pass the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/people-act-separating-fact-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For the People Act</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while gutting the filibuster entirely or even tweaking it might be a hard sell for Democrats, Americans are broadly in favor of certain other measures that would make it easier to vote. And according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/biden-democrats-voting-rights.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, the newest voting bill is expected to include several of these provisions, such as mandating 15 days of early, in-person voting, including at least two Sundays; expanding vote-by-mail; ending partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts; and creating a national voter ID requirement. According to an April survey from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/22/republicans-and-democrats-move-further-apart-in-views-of-voting-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, 63 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, as well as 91 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, supported making early, in-person voting available to voters at least two weeks prior to Election Day. A <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_062121/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June Monmouth University poll</a> also found bipartisan support for making early voting easier, with 89 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of Republicans in favor. And according to that Pew survey, voter ID laws were also incredibly popular among both Democrats and Republicans, with 61 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners and 93 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners supporting requiring all voters to show government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, just because something is popular with Republican voters doesn’t mean Republicans in Congress will back it — after all, we saw that happen <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-bidens-covid-19-relief-bill-help-democrats-avoid-a-midterm-defeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the COVID-19 stimulus package earlier this year</a>. And Republicans so far have shown little interest in passing <em>any</em> type of voting legislation at the federal level. In fact, when Schumer tried to get the chamber to debate voting rights proposals earlier this month, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/11/ted-cruz-voting-bill-congress-democrats-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Democrats of</a> trying to “strike down virtually every reasonable voter integrity law in the country.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, GOP politicians appear more focused on ensuring no one who is not eligible to vote votes rather than expanding access to the ballot. Just consider the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-have-made-it-harder-to-vote-in-11-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of restrictive voting bills</a> being passed by GOP-controlled legislatures at the state level. This, though, could be dangerous for Republicans. They gained among <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black men and Hispanic Americans in 2020</a>, but if the perception among these voters that Republicans <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t want people like them to vote</a> grows, that could negatively impact their overall opinion of the GOP. Moreover, Black and Hispanic voters are the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/georgias-proposed-voting-restrictions-will-harm-black-voters-most" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two groups of voters</a> most likely <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/racist-latino-vote-accelerates-texas-republicans-seek-restrictions-rcna1546" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be adversely affected</a> by restrictive voting bills at the state level.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, though, one of the biggest reasons why compromise between the two parties is so unlikely is because Republicans and Democrats view voting rights differently. And polls show a huge partisan split on whether voting is a privilege or a fundamental right. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/22/wide-partisan-divide-on-whether-voting-is-a-fundamental-right-or-a-privilege-with-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July report from Pew</a>, an overwhelming majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (78 percent) said that they view voting as a “fundamental right” for every U.S. citizen, while only 32 percent of Republican and Republican leaners felt the same. Instead, Republicans are more likely to view voting as a privilege that can be limited (67 percent of Republican and Republican leaners felt this way, versus 21 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners). There’s a racial divide here, too, with Black (77 percent), Hispanic (63 percent) and Asian Americans (66 percent) being far more likely than white Americans (51 percent) to say voting is a fundamental right.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian American adults were interviewed in English only, according to Pew, while white, Black and Asian American adults included those who said they’re one race and not Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> Bottom line: Democrats are much more likely than Republicans (70 percent to 32 percent, according to a June <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/06/09050746/210636_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> poll) to think restricting voting access is a major threat to American democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So because of all this, it’s highly unlikely Republicans and Democrats will meet in the middle on voting rights legislation this fall. Of course, if Republicans again stymie Democratic efforts to debate a voting rights bill next month, Democrats might have enough ammo to tweak the filibuster. But even that might have negative political repercussions for Democrats. That’s because both Democratic voters and elected officials don’t yet have a huge appetite for changing the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. All of this means that Democrats are likely to keep facing an uphill climb in enacting legislation to protect and expand voting access. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the generation’s overall progressive bent, this hasn’t translated into overwhelming Democratic support. In fact, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/11/gen-z-politics-2020-poll-takeaways-426767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some research suggests</a> that Gen Zers are no more likely to identify as members of the Democratic Party than registered voters in the overall electorate, and a plurality is unwilling to identify with either political party. That means that, despite their overwhelming support of Biden in the presidential election, there is also a small — but, so far, solid — chunk of Gen Z that identifies as Republican. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To better understand who these voters are and what motivates them to align with a party that has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/386791-mcconnell-i-wont-support-legalizing-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remained</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-change-and-republicans-congress-global-warming-2019-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/12/anti-abortion-activists-womens-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on many issues</a> important to Gen Z, I looked at polling data and political science for clues. I also spoke with six Gen Zers who voted for Trump and either identify as Republican or lean Republican. What I learned is that most of them break with the mainstream of the Republican Party on many social and cultural issues but solidly agree with the GOP’s <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/do-republican-economic-policies-work-4129139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stances on the economy</a>. They also think the Democratic Party, as it is now, has veered too far left, specifically with its stances on immigration, gun control and race. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“When it comes to Gen-Z Republicans, I think folks need to understand that we don’t fit neatly in a box, and I think that boggles the media,” said Javon Price, 23, a self-described conservative Republican who spoke in his personal capacity but works as a policy analyst for the <a href="https://americafirstpolicy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America First Policy Institute</a>, a nonprofit group <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-policy-institute-brooke-rollins-bac3f2f8-b41a-45a6-a962-aeb126a38d0e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allied with Trump</a> that promotes the former president’s policies. “We’re normal everyday people like everybody else, and political beliefs aren’t the end-all be-all.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans in this generation are more likely to take what they call “libertarian” approaches to social issues like same-sex marriage, and surveys show that these young Republicans are more likely to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-cancel-culture-became-an-issue-for-young-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care about “cancel culture”</a> than the electorate as a whole. They’re also <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/civic-and-political-attitudes-young-white-men" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly white and male</a>. But despite being more liberal on social issues than older Republicans, most of the young Republicans I spoke with admitted to me that they don’t see themselves ever leaving the GOP. And if Trump runs for president in 2024 and wins his party’s primary, most also said they would vote for him again. Even so, many of them are not too far behind their Democratic peers on a number of social issues, according to polling analysis as well as interviews with these young voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling from <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/nationscape" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape</a> found that both Democrats and Republicans in this generation, ages 18-24, have favorable opinions of people who are LGBTQ (83 percent of young Democrats have a favorable view compared with 66 percent of young Republicans) and support legalizing marijuana (67 percent of young Democrats compared to 55 percent of young Republicans). The gap between Democratic and Republican Gen Zers is also fairly small when it comes to separating children from their parents at the border when their parents could be prosecuted for illegally entering the U.S., with just 7 percent of young Democrats and 26 percent of young Republicans agreeing with that policy.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1760" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-1-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-1-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-1-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-1-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The fact that young Republicans aren’t that different from their Democratic peers on some social issues is largely on par with what academic research and studies from Pew have found, though not all social issues were as cut and dried. For example, even though two-thirds of Gen Zers <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/08/15/poll_gen_z_spurs_shift_in_voter_support_for_gun_control__141014.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">want stricter gun measures</a>, according to Rasmussen Reports survey data, young Republicans are still far less likely than young Democrats to want to ban assault rifles, according to Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape. One of the Republican men I spoke with said gun rights had even become a barometer for how he judges political candidates. “If you know somebody’s opinion on gun rights, you can make a pretty educated guess as to where they stand on every other issue — even unrelated ones,” Stephan Kapustka, 22, told me.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-2020-census-good-news-democrats-nate-silver-79467274</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Abortion may be another issue like this. Although the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape polling showed that a majority of Gen Zers from each party said they believe at least some abortions should be permitted — and only 16 percent of young Democrats and 33 percent of young Republicans said abortions should <em>never </em>be permitted — the issue divided the men I spoke with. For example, Price, who voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020, is strongly anti-abortion. Regarding his childhood neighborhood outside of Newark, New Jersey, he told me, “I could more easily find a Planned Parenthood than I could a park.” Henke, who is Christian, agreed; during a separate phone call, he said he used to take a more hands-off stance toward abortion but switched to an anti-abortion stance after talking with his pastor. Matthew C., meanwhile, told me he’s pro-abortion rights. Overall, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246278/abortion-trends-party.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few Republicans want to outright ban abortion</a>, but this is one social issue where young Republicans appear to be closer to the opinions of their elders in the party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the biggest gaps between Gen-Z Republicans and Democrats aren’t on social issues. It’s how they view issues of economic and foreign policy. And for many young Republicans, that’s what’s driving their support of the GOP. For example, Gen-Z Democrats are way more likely than Gen-Z Republicans to support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour (79 percent for young Democrats compared with 43 percent for young Republicans), cutting taxes for families that make less than $100,000 a year (69 percent compared with 43 percent) and raising taxes for families that make over $600,000 a year (70 percent compared with 38 percent).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1256" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/samuels.GENZREPUBLICANS.0823-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“A lot of us are very financially motivated, and maybe that’s because we grew up in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-guide-to-the-financial-crisis--10-years-later/2018/09/10/114b76ba-af10-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Great Recession</a>,” Henke told me. “I was raised to be financially responsible because my parents started with pretty much nothing and now they’re both pretty successful. They’ve taught me and my family to be fiscally responsible, and that’s the biggest thing that motivates me.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, even though the Democratic Party is closer in line with where some of these Gen-Z Republicans stand on social issues, it might be economic policy — plus opposition to abortion and gun control — that has a bigger hold on them. Some of Trump’s more populist messaging around “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/525551816/trumps-efforts-to-drain-the-swamp-lagging-behind-his-campaign-rhetoric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draining the swamp</a>” has also resonated with them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[Trump] made me really proud to be an American and made me feel like the American Dream is alive and well,” Luke T. said. “He did a really good job of grabbing hold of people’s frustration with the establishment, and I liked that he was an outsider, rather than a traditional Republican.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just the economy and Trump that has made these young voters loyal to the GOP. Kapustka told me he’s open to more left-leaning views on social issues, but that he’s had conversations with his fellow Republican friends who think that “the Democrats don’t really care about them because they’re evil, white males or something like that.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Data and interviews with Gen-Z Republicans illustrate a cap on young Republicans’ more socially liberal views, particularly as it pertains to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-attacking-cancel-culture-and-woke-people-is-becoming-the-gops-new-political-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent political fights</a> over “cancel culture” and how socially progressive or “woke” Americans should be. For instance, polling from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape found that over half (55 percent) of Gen-Z Republicans believe we should end the practice of shaming people who say things that aren’t politically correct, versus 38 percent of Gen-Z Democrats who believe the same. This could be related to research that suggests Republicans are more likely than Democrats to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-did-republicans-outperform-the-polls-again-two-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say that they self-censor their political views</a> due to fear of judgment for what they believe. “Shutting people down or attacking them on Twitter seems to be a new thing,” Matthew C. told me. “And I think ‘cancel culture’ is horrible. I grew up around social media and the internet, and they both can be very toxic.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, political science research suggests that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">young voters are shaped</a> by what happens in their late adolescence and early adult years, so if there is a fear among younger Republicans that voicing their political views risks retribution, it could explain in part why <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-republicans-are-happy-to-stoke-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent GOP culture-war issues</a> have played such a role in shaping these voters’ political consciousness. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, there’s still <em>a lot </em>we don’t know about Gen Z as a whole because they make up <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10 percent</a> of the electorate. Moreover, most of what we do know is limited to how they voted in the past one or two presidential races. But it’s possible that, over time, Gen-Z Republicans won’t be a political minority. There’s already <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/706889" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some evidence</a> that today’s younger liberals might get more conservative as they get older, and <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-gops-gen-z-problem-and-path-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly one-third</a> of Gen-Z voters who don’t identify as Republican said that they would consider voting for a moderate Republican candidate, according to a June 2020 survey by the Niskanen Center. For now, though, young Republicans are just a small slice of the electorate, but as long as the party sticks to its roots — or, its founding principles of small government and free enterprise — it’s unlikely these voters are going anywhere anytime soon. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, we laid out the uncertainty over <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the American public would react</a> to the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. Since then, several polls have been conducted and released that take into account last weekend’s turmoil, and a tentative picture is emerging: Americans are upset about how the withdrawal of U.S. troops has unfolded, and they are eager to see the U.S. help clean up the mess. But Americans are also fickle — even self-contradictory — when it comes to foreign policy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, only 25 percent of registered voters believed the Afghanistan withdrawal was going very or somewhat well, and 57 percent thought it was going not too well or not well at all, according to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/16/afghanistan-withdrawal-taliban-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> poll conducted Aug. 13-16, as Kabul was falling to the Taliban. And Americans largely blame President Biden for this: A subsequent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/19/afghanistan-withdrawal-blame-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> poll, conducted Aug. 16-19, found that 43 percent of registered voters thought Biden held a great deal of responsibility for the situation — more than Congress or any of Biden’s three predecessors, who all clocked in at 24 to 27 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other polling agrees that the public is unhappy with Biden’s handling of the Afghanistan War. Morning Consult/Politico’s Aug. 13-16 poll found that voters disapproved of his handling of Afghanistan, 51 percent to 31 percent. In a poll fielded Aug. 14-17, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/oacaip2ls4/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a> found a similar result among all adults, with Biden receiving a 42 percent disapproval and 32 percent approval rating on his handling of the war. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-ending-war-afghanistan-79488089</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Even the best poll for Biden gave him a middling score. An <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/lbvgnnggapq/Afghanistan_Snap_Topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos/Reuters</a> survey conducted on Aug. 16 found that 44 percent of adults thought the Biden administration had done a good job on Afghanistan, while 42 percent thought it had done a bad job. His three immediate predecessors — George W. Bush (47 percent good, 39 percent bad), Barack Obama (51 percent good, 38 percent bad) and Donald Trump (51 percent good, 36 percent bad) — all got better, though not stellar, grades.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the bigger picture, Biden’s net approval rating is also at its lowest point in his presidency, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average</a>: 49.1 percent approval, 44.5 percent disapproval. This may well be partially due to the news in Afghanistan: For instance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos/Reuters</a> found that Biden’s approval rating dropped sharply — 7 percentage points — between Friday, Aug. 13, and Monday, Aug. 16. However, Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was slipping even before</a> the Taliban took over, so it’s also clear that Afghanistan isn’t the only factor at play here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The grim headlines have also made some Americans rethink their support for withdrawing troops at all. As my colleague Geoffrey Skelley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on Monday</a>, net support for withdrawal was extremely high before last weekend: between +28 and +46 points. But five polls conducted since Aug. 13<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned Morning Consult, Morning Consult/Politico and YouGov/The Economist polls, plus one poll each from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/20210817_US_JohnZogby.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;John Zogby Strategies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/8/17/voters-support-withdrawing-troops-from-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Data for Progress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>23</sup></a> all showed support for withdrawal dropping to between 45 and 53 percent, while opposition had risen to between 32 and 37 percent. Notably, of course, this still means more Americans support withdrawal than oppose it, by 12- to 17-point margins.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a caveat: How pollsters word their questions can change the poll’s results. For instance, when YouGov/The Economist asked, “Do you think the United States made a mistake by recently withdrawing troops from Afghanistan?,” Americans were divided: 33 percent said yes, 36 percent said no and 31 percent weren’t sure. Similarly, when Morning Consult/Politico asked, “​​Do you believe the U.S. should still withdraw its military presence in Afghanistan if it means the Taliban regains control of most of Afghanistan?” — something that has indeed come to pass — only 38 percent of registered voters responded that troops should still withdraw, while 45 percent said that they should not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And sometimes, respondents outright contradicted themselves. In the Ipsos/Reuters poll, Americans supported completing the withdrawal of troops on schedule, 61 percent to 25 percent. But they also said, 50 percent to 36 percent, that they supported “sending combat troops back into Afghanistan to fight the Taliban.” Likewise, 68 percent of adults agreed with the statement that the war was going to end badly no matter when the U.S. left, while only 18 percent disagreed. But the same respondents also agreed, 51 percent to 32 percent, with the statement that “it would have been worth it for the United States to leave troops in Afghanistan for another year.” These conflicting results might reflect <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/26/will-foreign-policy-be-a-major-issue-in-the-2016-election-heres-what-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how little Americans know about foreign policy</a> and how, until recently, they spent <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-domestic-political-fallout-from-the-afghanistan-war-is-so-hard-to-assess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very little time thinking about Afghanistan as an issue</a>. (As a result, voters often need to <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo5514391.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn to political leaders for guidance on issues of foreign policy</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One thing that does come across clearly in the polls, though, is Americans’ desire to address the humanitarian crisis that has arisen because of the Taliban takeover. Polls found extremely strong support for helping Afghans whose lives are now in danger. In the Ipsos/Reuters poll, 73 percent of adults supported evacuating Afghans who aided American troops and bringing them to the U.S., while just 16 percent were opposed. And Americans were also willing to deploy American troops to hold off the Taliban so that such an evacuation could take place, 68 percent to 18 percent. According to a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/8/17/voters-support-withdrawing-troops-from-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data for Progress</a> poll fielded Aug. 13-16, Americans also favor speeding up the visa process so that Afghans can resettle in the U.S., 55 percent to 30 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the same vein, a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2021/08/17/fcdbe/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> survey on Aug. 17 found that 65 percent of U.S. adults supported accepting Afghans who worked for “U.S.-based news organizations, U.S.-based aid and development agencies and other relief groups that receive U.S. funding” as refugees into the U.S.; only 15 percent were opposed. When <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2021/08/18/61982/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> asked people the following day about resettling Afghan refugees in “your own state,” 61 percent supported it and 19 percent opposed it — a very similar margin, though it does seem like a few Americans are OK with accepting refugees in general but don’t want them in their area. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given how some nativist Republicans are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/afghan-refugees-republicans/2021/08/18/3592aaa0-005e-11ec-825d-01701f9ded64_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stoking fears around the idea of accepting refugees</a>, though, it’s worth watching to see if these numbers change. Morning Consult’s Aug. 16-19 poll revealed that support for evacuating Afghans into the U.S. was lower when respondents were offered the option to evacuate Afghans to somewhere other than the U.S. While 42 percent of registered voters liked the idea of the U.S. both evacuating Afghans and offering them refugee status, 28 percent wanted the U.S. to evacuate them but not offer them refugee status. (An additional 11 percent did not want the U.S. to assist with evacuations at all.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, the American withdrawal and the Taliban takeover mark the final chapter of a war with a mixed legacy among the American public. The war started with a public mandate: In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, upward of 90 percent of the public thought the U.S. was right to intervene in Afghanistan, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/352793/americans-split-whether-afghanistan-war-mistake.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a>. But the share who felt the war was a mistake steadily increased over the next decade. And now, per YouGov/The Economist, 38 percent of Americans thought the U.S. made a mistake deploying troops to fight in Afghanistan, and only 28 percent did not think it was a mistake (although a relatively high 34 percent weren’t sure). An Aug. 12-16 survey from the <a href="https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Afghanistan-topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> also reported that Americans now feel the war in Afghanistan was not worth fighting, 62 percent to 35 percent — making it essentially as unpopular as the war in Iraq. And a separate <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2021/08/17/fcdbe/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> poll from Aug. 17 found that only 6 percent of Americans felt that the U.S. won the war in Afghanistan; 38 percent felt that we had lost it, while 39 percent thought we had neither won nor lost. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps most damningly, Americans were deeply ambivalent about whether the war had accomplished any good for the Afghan people. Per <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2021/08/17/fcdbe/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a>, 26 percent of Americans thought it made life better for Afghans, 23 percent thought it made life worse and 27 percent thought it didn’t make life either better or worse. Twenty-four percent didn’t know.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Of the three gubernatorial elections taking place in 2021, New Jersey’s has flown under the radar. And a new <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_NJ_081821/">Monmouth University</a> poll underscores why: It isn’t shaping up to be very competitive. In an average of Monmouth’s two likely voter models, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy took 53 percent, while Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli took 38 percent. If Murphy wins, he’ll be the first Democrat reelected as New Jersey governor since 1977.</li><li>Marijuana usage in the U.S. has reached a new … high. According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/353645/nearly-half-adults-tried-marijuana.aspx">Gallup</a>, 49 percent of adults admit to having tried marijuana at some point in their lives. That number had steadily crept up from 4 percent in 1969 to the previous record of 45 percent in both 2017 and 2019.</li><li>A new poll from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/08/17/dc-move-pandemic-poll/">The Washington Post/Schar School of Policy and Government</a> found that 23 percent of metro Washington, D.C., residents had seriously considered moving to a new community since the start of the pandemic. However, only 15 percent have actually moved homes, and two-thirds of those said their reasons for moving were not related to the coronavirus.</li><li>Last week, actor and neuroscientist Mayim Bialik and “Jeopardy!” executive producer Mike Richards were named the two new hosts of the beloved quiz show, with Bialik overseeing primetime specials and Richards helming the flagship program. According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/17/new-jeopardy-hosts-poll/">Morning Consult</a>, viewers approved of Bialik’s casting 70 percent to 9 percent — but Richards received just 47 percent to 16 percent approval/disapproval, with 37 percent reserving judgment (the poll was conducted before The Ringer <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/8/18/22631299/mike-richards-jeopardy-host-search-process-past-comments">reported on allegations</a> that Richards had used sexist and demeaning language). Of all the guest hosts who tried out for the show, Bialik was the second-most popular choice (with 13 percent of respondents choosing her as their favorite), while Richards was tied for seventh (with 3 percent). America’s preferred replacement for the legendary Alex Trebek was actor LeVar Burton (16 percent) — jibing with the fact that more than 267,000 people advocated for him in an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sony-pictures-entertainment-levar-burton-should-be-the-next-host-of-jeopardy">online petition</a>.</li><li>On Sunday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the country would hold its next federal election on Sept. 20. According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s and Éric Grenier’s <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/">Poll Tracker</a> — a weighted average of Canadian election polls similar to FiveThirtyEight’s — Trudeau’s Liberals currently lead in that campaign, with 35 percent of the vote. The Conservative Party garners 29 percent, and the New Democratic Party sits at 20 percent.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Aug. 12, the U.S. Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/2020-census-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released detailed redistricting data</a> that states will use to draw their congressional lines. These new maps are important because they will not only help determine <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which party has an advantage moving into the 2022 midterms</a>, but also influence whether members of the U.S. House of Representatives seek reelection, run for another office or leave political life entirely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, complications from redistricting may have influenced two Democratic House members in highly competitive seats to announce their exits recently, portending trouble for their party in next year’s midterm elections. Perhaps most notably, longtime Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/10/kind-reelection-503343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced on Aug. 10 that he wouldn’t seek reelection</a>. With Kind retiring, it will be challenging for Democrats to hold on to his rural, western Wisconsin seat, which is about 9 percentage points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric</a>.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> And in Pennsylvania, Rep. Conor Lamb, a relative newcomer, is leaving his Pittsburgh-area seat, which is 2 points more Republican than the country as a whole. This district could be a tough one for Democrats to retain, especially if redistricting makes his seat even more Republican. Lamb’s motivations are different from Kind’s, however: Lamb is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/us/politics/conor-lamb-senate-race-pa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running for retiring Republican Pat Toomey’s seat in the Senate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, House Democrats are sitting out reelection for numerous reasons, but it’s an important thing to track, as retirements and runs for other offices can hint at what members expect the midterm landscape to look like. Take the 2018 midterm cycle, when about two times as many House Republicans as Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/here-are-all-the-republicans-retiring-from-congress-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to leave office</a> ahead of that year’s “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-it-was-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blue wave</a>.” And while House Democrats are currently nowhere near the 39 Republicans who threw in the towel before the 2018 election, these departures are still an early warning for them, especially considering Democrats hold a narrow 222-to-213 seat majority,<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This count includes &lt;a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Members#Vacancies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;three vacancies in seats&lt;/a&gt; that are safe for one party or the other &amp;#8212; two formerly Democratic-held seats and one formerly Republican-held seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>26</sup></a> meaning Republicans need a net gain of just five seats to capture the chamber. The fact that Democrats may be in trouble shouldn’t come as a surprise, though, since the president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-2020-gains-in-the-house-set-them-up-well-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually loses ground in midterm House elections</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, 16 representatives have announced their departures,<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> but in another ominous sign for Democrats, the type of seats the two parties are leaving open differs dramatically, as the table below shows. Seven of the eight outgoing Democrats represent districts that are less than 5 points more Democratic than the country as a whole — including the seats held by Kind and Lamb — which could make those seats easier for the GOP to flip next year. By comparison, only one Republican is leaving a seat that’s less than 10 points more Republican, meaning retirements and departures from office haven’t left the GOP as exposed.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, more Democrats (four) than Republicans (two) have announced they aren’t running for reelection or seeking another office — what we call “pure” retirements — and while it’s still early, a continuation of that trend would be another indication that Democrats are concerned about the midterm environment. Indeed, there’s been a tendency in midterm years for the president’s party to have <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/exit-stage-left-or-right-midterm-retirements-and-open-seats-in-the-u-s-house-from-1974-to-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more pure retirements</a> than the out-of-office party. And at this point, the pure retirements for Republicans have more to do with scandal (in the case of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/21/politics/tom-reed-sexual-misconduct-allegation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Rep. Tom Reed</a>, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct) or the loss of ranking member status <a href="https://www.congressionalinstitute.org/2019/10/23/time-for-house-republicans-to-reform-term-limit-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to GOP term limits</a> on leadership posts (in the case of <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/14/kevin-brady-congress-texas-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Rep. Kevin Brady</a>), and less to do with redistricting woes.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-2020-census-good-news-democrats-nate-silver-79467274</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">As noted earlier — as well as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/only-11-house-members-have-said-theyre-not-running-again-heres-why-thats-important-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in May</a> — concerns about redistricting have certainly played a role in many of the Democratic departures, such as those of Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Texas Rep. Filemón Vela. And take again Democrats’ most recent departures, Kind and Lamb. Even though they don’t hail from states where the GOP alone controls redistricting (it’s split partisan control in both states), they too may be worried about redistricting. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Elections/2020-us-house-election-results-live-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Each barely won reelection in 2020,</a> and new district lines to fortify their chances of winning again aren’t a safe bet given that certain geographical realities make it unlikely that their seats get much bluer. For instance, Kind’s 3rd Congressional District in Wisconsin <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/wisconsin-decisive-again-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has swung sharply to the right</a> in recent years, and three of the four districts it borders in the state are solidly GOP-leaning, so unless the district absorbs Democratic-leaning turf near the deep-blue city of Madison, new lines aren’t likely to make the R+9 seat significantly more Democratic. Meanwhile, it might not appear that Lamb is abandoning ship by running for Senate, but Pennsylvania as a whole is about R+3 and could end up being more Democratic than Lamb’s district after new lines are drawn. That’s because Pennsylvania will lose one district in reapportionment, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VsWXBX_cVFcfaxHdlAMzzhJYRWgayzWxsJ3rdOlO-24/edit#gid=1761243994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so the remaining districts must add population</a>, including Lamb’s 17th Congressional District, which is already R+2. That could <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-redistricting-congressional-map-20210427.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessitate adding population from GOP-leaning turf</a> in nearby districts, and/or Lamb’s district could also lose some of its more Democratic-leaning areas to the Pittsburgh-based 18th Congressional District, too, which needs to add even more population than the 17th District does.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to overstate the impact redistricting might have on Democrats deciding to leave the House. Overall, Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will draw lines for about 2.5 times as many seats as Democrats</a>. Republicans will draw the lines in four of the eight Democratic open seats, and in six of the eight Republican open seats. This means that four Democratic representatives — Ryan and Vela as well as Florida’s Charlie Crist and Val Demings — won’t be defending seats next year in states where Republicans control redistricting. And outside of Demings, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/politics/val-demings-announces-senate-campaign/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has launched a Senate campaign</a> to challenge Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, the other three represent competitive districts that could become more GOP-leaning. (Only Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick’s Arizona seat will be drawn by a commission.) Conversely, Democrats will draw lines for only two of the GOP-held seats — those of New York Reps. Lee Zeldin and Reed — as well as retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos’s district in Illinois. That could enable Democrats <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-state/where-democrats-draw-line.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pick up Zeldin’s district</a> — Reed’s district <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1427389029562077188?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is more likely</a> to become a GOP <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2011/5/4/972944/-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote sink</a> — and also maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1426670332837076997?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect Bustos’s seat</a>, but they simply have fewer opportunities to redraw districts in their favor than the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bottom line: At this point, the departure of members like Kind and Lamb makes it harder for Democrats to hold on to potentially competitive House seats, and the overall picture has worsened for Democrats as more of their vulnerable members exit the House. While these developments are not yet a death blow to Democrats’ chances of retaining their House majority, they do signal how tough it will be for Democrats to hold off Republicans next year. Redistricting, along with the classic penalty for the president’s party in midterm elections, could put Democrats in a pretty big hole.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): In April, President Biden announced that it was time to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/us/politics/biden-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end the “forever” war in Afghanistan</a> by sending home the roughly 2,500 Americans troops that remained there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It wasn’t apparent at the time, but that decision now appears to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/us/politics/afghanistan-biden-administration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set in motion the collapse of the Afghan government</a>. Over the weekend, the Taliban, the ousted militant group that came to power in the country in the mid-1990s, seized control of the capital, weeks before the U.S. was set to withdraw its remaining troops.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Afghanistan War has spanned four presidencies now, so it’s hard to blame Biden entirely for what’s happened there (and it’s not clear at this point that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans will</a>). But Biden’s exit strategy certainly has <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/08/15/war-veterans-families-afghanistan-united-states-government/8143821002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people asking what the last 20 years were for</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-ending-war-afghanistan-79488089</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s talk about how the Afghanistan War became a 20-year conflict in the first place; how Americans feel about the Afghanistan War and whether Americans’ thoughts on war are changing; and finally, the potential domestic political repercussions of the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, how did the war last for 20 years? And how different were our perceptions of the war from what was happening on the ground?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal</strong> (Tanisha Fazal, professor of political science at the University of Minnesota): One reason the war lasted as long as it has is because most Americans don’t grasp the costs of war. Less than 1 percent of the population <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-percentage-of-americans-have-served-in-the-military/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serves in the military</a>, meaning most people don’t know someone who serves. The human costs of war have also changed. U.S. military medicine has <a href="https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/65/1/160/5905233?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved dramatically over time</a>, especially since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. What this means is that most U.S. casualties today are nonfatal casualties, so a lot of the human consequences of war are less visible to Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also, the way the U.S. pays for war has changed. As political scientist Sarah Kreps has written, we <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/taxing-wars-9780190865306?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used to finance wars via taxes</a>, but today, we finance wars by adding to the national debt. Put all this together, and you have a very small group paying the most immediate, visible costs of war. The rest of us are also paying those costs, but they’re much harder to see.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky</strong> (Adam Berinsky, professor of political science at MIT): As a public opinion scholar, I would also add that ongoing military action — even war — just isn’t something that’s super important to most Americans. We saw this <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/18097/iraq-versus-vietnam-comparison-public-opinion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Iraq War</a>, and it was true with Afghanistan as well. This kept a lot of things that were happening in Afghanistan off the American public’s radar.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> Consider, too, that the military is now an all-volunteer force. There was a draft for the Vietnam War, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/vietnam-war/draft-picker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring many young men to serve</a>, which is at least one reason why that war <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/opinion/vietnam-antiwar-movement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw so many protests</a> compared to <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-america/2018-08-20/united-states-perpetual-war-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afghanistan, which saw relatively few</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> I think you got a little of the dynamic that Tanisha is talking about during the Iraq conflict, when <a href="https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/576180/the-national-guards-contribution-300000-plus-iraq-deployments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Guard units were called into service</a>. But as she notes, widespread direct involvement in military action is much lower today relative to the Vietnam War era.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst): Right, Afghanistan wasn’t really on most Americans’ radars. Weekly polls from the Economist/YouGov used to ask people regularly how important they thought the Afghanistan War was: As recently as February 2020, <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/zye3phsf7t/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 29 percent of Americans</a> thought it was “very important,” whereas 69 percent said the economy was very important. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, this doesn’t mean Americans didn’t necessarily care about terrorism — the direct catalyst for the war back in 2001 — more broadly, as 53 percent did say terrorism was “very important” in that same poll. It’s just that the concern didn’t necessarily connect with the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Another thing that stood out to me from the Washington Post’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 investigation into the Afghanistan War</a> was all the ways in which the military and various presidential administrations weren’t honest with the American people about the war, routinely saying things were going far more smoothly in Afghanistan than they actually were.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So there’s the fact that the Afghanistan War wasn’t an important issue for most Americans as you’ve all mentioned, but it’s hard for me to disentangle that from the flawed public perception of how things were going in Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>I also thought this stat from Marquette Law School pollster Charles Franklin was telling: </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can find only 15 survey questions concerning Bush's handling of Afghanistan in the entire 2001-2009 Bush presidency.<br><br>There were 628 questions about his handling of Iraq.</p>— Charles Franklin (@PollsAndVotes) <a href="https://twitter.com/PollsAndVotes/status/1426970149941301249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> To Nathaniel’s point, in researching <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo5514391.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my book on American public opinion and war</a>, I found that after the end of 2002, pollsters basically stopped asking questions about Afghanistan. There was some polling done in 2003 and after, but very few polls were conducted compared to the early stages of the war.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Why was the Iraq War polled more than the Afghanistan War?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> I think in part it was because Afghanistan seemed at first to be a “settled” public issue. The Taliban government fell quickly after the 2001 invasion, and the international community turned to trying to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan soon after. Support for the Afghanistan War also stayed <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23044842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">above 80 percent through all of 2002</a>, while support for <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/19/iraq-war-continues-to-divide-u-s-public-15-years-after-it-began/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Iraq War</a> never reached those levels. The Afghanistan War simply seemed to have more of an “over and done with” perception even though U.S. troops were still in the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The media also moved onto other domestic and foreign policy issues. And even when support for the Afghanistan War fell, it still hovered around 60 percent for several years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, and Iraq was obviously more in the headlines during the later years of the Bush administration as it became clear that there were <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7634313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no weapons of mass destruction</a> and as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/world/middleeast/24iraq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violence among Iraqis increased</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> The “mission accomplished” slogan in Afghanistan speaks to what Sarah said earlier about the Post’s “Afghanistan Papers” investigation. The reasons for Afghanistan War appear to have shifted over time and, in the end, were ultimately quite unclear.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> We’ve touched on this a bit already, but how have Americans’ thoughts on the Afghanistan War changed? Do Americans think the war was broadly worth it?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Gallup has asked <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/352793/americans-split-whether-afghanistan-war-mistake.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans since 2001 whether they thought it was a mistake to send troops to fight in Afghanistan</a>. Initially, most Americans didn’t think the war was a mistake, but the latest poll (taken in July) found the country about evenly split on it.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="438" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/chat.AFGHANISTAN-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/chat.AFGHANISTAN-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/chat.AFGHANISTAN-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/chat.AFGHANISTAN-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> You can see in the chart that from 2007 to 2014 increasing numbers of Americans thought their country made a mistake in sending troops to Afghanistan, but other polls show that there hasn’t been a lot of movement after that span. Rather, most polls show <a href="https://www.pollingreport.com/afghan.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American support for the war has been relatively flat</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> The most recent poll, from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/oacaip2ls4/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist on Aug. 14-17</a> (so after it was clear Kabul would fall to the Taliban), found that 38 percent of Americans thought it was a mistake for us to intervene in Afghanistan in the first place. But only 28 percent thought it was <em>not</em> a mistake — so plenty of Americans aren’t really sure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> It’s also important to remember, though, that most people, most of the time, don’t pay much (if any) attention to issues of foreign policy — even war.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means even though there have been a lot of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kabul-airport-people-fall-from-planes-leaving-afghanistan-videos-photos-2021-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatic images this week</a> of Afghans trying to flee for safety, with many Americans now reconsidering their opinions of the war, that will likely be short-lived. Within a few weeks, I’d guess interest will return to the low levels we’ve seen in the last decade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even now, with interest in Afghanistan high, the share of “not sure” responses is still pretty high, suggesting that this issue will fail to resonate strongly with many Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Bingo. As Nathaniel discussed last year, based on Adam’s work, Americans often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/foreign-policy-doesnt-usually-affect-elections-could-iran-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take their cues on foreign policy from leaders in their party</a> because they aren’t as informed on it and don’t have obvious ideological corners to run to.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> To your point, Adam, when Afghanistan has gotten cable-news attention in the past, it has just as quickly faded from the headlines. Check out these numbers from Robert Griffin, a senior research advisor at Democracy Fund:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anyone with Takes about the political consequences Biden will face, I ask that you fill in the rest of this figure.<br><br>I don't take joy in saying that Americans will quickly ignore what is happening in Afghanistan, but I think it's fairly obvious that it's going to happen. <a href="https://t.co/RE998NVJFh">pic.twitter.com/RE998NVJFh</a></p>— Robert Griffin (@rp_griffin) <a href="https://twitter.com/rp_griffin/status/1427322936038416385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> I do think, though, that Americans’ general relationship to war has changed in that the immediate costs of war are just a lot less visible, as I said at the outset.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In thinking about the broader foreign policy context, the withdrawal from Afghanistan also signals a greater shift in where America is focusing its international strategy: <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R43838.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China</a>. And any military conflict with China would look very different from the Afghanistan War.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> That’s a good point, Tanisha. One thing we wrote about in 2019 was how Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-agree-that-wwii-was-justified-recent-conflicts-are-more-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t think recent military conflicts have been justified</a>, starting with the Vietnam War. So I do think, to your point, <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2019/09/do-americans-really-want-end-forever-wars-survey-says/159760/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American public’s relationship to war is changing</a>. There’s just less support for military conflict, broadly speaking. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as you point out, China is increasingly where America is focusing its attention abroad, and at least right now, both Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/04/democrats-republicans-seem-agree-about-one-foreign-policy-point-getting-tough-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seem to view China negatively</a>. I do think, then, that any potential military conflict would be thought of differently.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turning back to Afghanistan, do we have any sense for how Americans are reacting from the events over the weekend?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Overall, Americans are unhappy with how the withdrawal was handled. According to Morning Consult/Politico, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/16/afghanistan-withdrawal-taliban-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 25 percent of registered voters</a> believed the Afghanistan withdrawal was going “very well” or “somewhat well,” and 57 percent thought it was going “not too well” or “not well at all.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There was also a drop in the share of Americans who support withdrawal — from 69 percent in April to 49 percent this month. But more Americans still support withdrawal than oppose it, 49 percent to 37 percent.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/bidens-approval-rating-fallen-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79388894</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> What has this meant for Biden’s approval rating so far? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Reuters/Ipsos found that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval rating dropped 7 points between Friday and Monday</a>. It seems likely that that was due to the Afghanistan news. But his approval rating was also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping before the weekend</a>, so his current low point definitely isn’t all because of what’s happened in Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> It’s going to be really hard to peel apart what’s happening to Biden’s approval rating because of Afghanistan and what’s happening because of COVID-19. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> Yeah, that’s right, Adam. In the longer term, I would guess that any relationship between Biden’s approval rating and Afghanistan (insofar as you can disentangle from everything else, like COVID-19) is going to depend on whether there are terrorist attacks against American citizens, especially on U.S. soil.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s interesting that the Taliban have been signaling that they will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/world/asia/taliban-leaders-kabul.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more restrained when it comes to international terrorism</a>; they seem to want to be able to engage with the rest of the world. That said, they’re <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11451718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not exactly trustworthy</a>, and I worry Afghans are in for a really horrible time, as the chances for human rights violations under this regime are very high. But the Taliban do have incentives to try and restrain themselves, and are also under <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7ceb9e3b-bd6e-43fe-bb86-80353249e6ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some pressure from Russia and China</a>. So we’ll see.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To Nathaniel’s point on the withdrawal question, it seems that we’ll want to be careful in distinguishing responses on “should we withdraw” from “what do you think of the withdrawal.” Lots of people supported withdrawal but still recognize that this process is going terribly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah. I’m curious, though, if the fact that a plurality of voters still supported withdrawing troops suggests that number will bounce back up after the overwhelming news coverage of Afghanistan fades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, the issue might not fade that quickly if there continue to be new developments and disturbing images coming out of Afghanistan, so perhaps people’s opinions will be more sticky.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The threat of terrorism, as Tanisha mentioned, strikes me as the biggest unknown here. Obviously, Adam’s and others’ research shows that foreign policy isn’t often a super important issue for voters, but I imagine we’ll see an uptick in the share of Americans who are concerned about a terrorist attack. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider that earlier this year, the Pew Research Center’s annual poll on policy priorities found that 63 percent of Americans thought defending the nation against terrorist attacks <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/PP_2021.01.28_policy-priorities_TOPLINE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should still be a high priority</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> According to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/oacaip2ls4/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week’s YouGov/The Economist poll</a>, though, just 19 percent of Americans believe a terrorist attack against the U.S. is “very likely” in the next 12 months; 29 percent think it is “somewhat likely”; 19 percent think it is “not very likely”; and 8 percent think it is “very unlikely.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Adam and Tanisha, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my article about public opinion and Afghanistan</a>, I noted that we might see sharper partisan divides over policy in Afghanistan given it’s in the news and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/16/republicans-criticize-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican leaders in Congress</a> — and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/trump-blasts-biden-not-following-152440623.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside the Capitol</a> — are hammering Biden on it. But previously, there <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/us-public-supports-withdrawal-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hadn’t been as much of a split</a> on the issue of withdrawal. Do you think that will change? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> I think that’s right, Geoffrey. Republican politicians are criticizing Biden for what happened, so I expect that Republican voters would also say that this week’s events are a disaster. And if Democratic politicians jump on board as well in their criticism of Biden, we could see a real drop in his approval. Although, I’d caution that things are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assessing-President-Opinion-Public-Support/dp/0804720967" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more locked in today when it comes to a president’s approval rating</a>, given how polarized our politics are.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if both Democratic and Republican elites criticize Biden, we would essentially move to what political scientist John Zaller calls a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/nature-and-origins-of-mass-opinion/70B1485D3A9CFF55ADCCDD42FC7E926A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-sided information flow</a> — or that when elites from both sides speak the same message, the public largely unifies behind them. Think of it as a sort of reverse “rally around the flag” effect.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> I do wonder how the arrival of Afghan refugees might play into all of this, especially given <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarization around immigration</a> and, frankly, race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Right now at least, support for accepting Afghan refugees is very high. According to YouGov, Americans <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2021/08/17/fcdbe/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support accepting Afghan refugees</a> who worked with Americans into the U.S. 65 percent to 15 percent. And the <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2021/08/18/61982/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numbers are similar</a> if you ask respondents about accepting Afghan refugees who backed the U.S. military to “[their] own state,” although there does seem to be a small “not in my backyard” contingent. But I definitely think there is potential for former President Donald Trump and other nativist politicians to racialize that issue as you hinted at, Tanisha.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>To what extent will the withdrawal from Afghanistan affect Biden’s presidency? Do we have a sense yet of what this means for Biden?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I think the questions for his legacy are interesting, Sarah. But in the short term, my bet is that Afghanistan will quickly fade from the headlines and this won’t affect the 2022 midterms or Biden’s reelection campaign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>adam.berinsky:</strong> Think back to the Iran coverage in early 2020 and its possible effect on the 2020 election — and how that never materialized.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>tanisha.fazal:</strong> I agree with Nathaniel and Adam. The one caveat is if there’s a terrorist attack. Otherwise, I think COVID-19/the economy will have a much bigger effect on Biden’s presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Polarization has made <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-approval-rating-has-barely-budged-in-his-first-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential approval ratings extremely steady</a>, as we’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written repeatedly</a>. And I think you can bet on about 10 major news stories breaking between now and November 2022, each of which will be touted as a “<a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/why-campaign-game-changers-rarely-change-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game changer</a>” and then promptly forgotten about.</p>

<p>Opponents of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California have gathered enough signatures to trigger a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gavin-newsom-has-reason-to-worry/">recall election</a> for him on Sept. 14 — only the fourth gubernatorial recall election in U.S. history. If a majority of Californians vote “yes” to recall, Newsom will be removed from office.</p>

<p>If Newsom is removed from office, the second question on the recall ballot will determine his replacement. Forty-six candidates are in the running, and it just takes a simple plurality to win, meaning a candidate could win with only minority support (there is no runoff). Californians can vote on the second question even if they vote against recalling Newsom on the first question.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In early August, President Biden <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2021/08/03/desantis-blames-media-for-hysteria-over-covid-surge-1389404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took aim at Republican governors</a> like Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas for not taking enough precautions to counter the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surge in COVID-19 cases</a> in their states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But DeSantis was quick to pin the blame on Biden instead, <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/new-gop-message-on-surging-covid-its-juans-fault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing the following in a fundraising email</a> to supporters: “Joe Biden has the nerve to tell me to get out of the way on COVID while he lets COVID-infected migrants pour over our southern border by the hundreds of thousands. No elected official is doing more to enable the transmission of COVID in America than Joe Biden with his open borders policies.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Only what DeSantis is claiming isn’t borne out by data. Rather, according to <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/06/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-effort-blame-covid-19-spread-migrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public health experts</a>, the far more likely culprit for the surge in Florida’s cases is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state’s low vaccination rates</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">DeSantis’s decision to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/fabiola-santiago/article253269883.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scapegoat immigrants</a> for the record number of coronavirus cases is important, though, as it speaks to a larger strategy within the GOP: attack Biden’s immigration policies at every conceivable turn. Prominent Republicans, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-border-visit/2021/06/30/8c5165ac-d91c-11eb-8fb8-aea56b785b00_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbGyi9H-v1g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sens. Ted Cruz</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/lindsey-graham-biden-apology-southern-border-migrant-children-b1823688.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsey Graham</a>, not to mention dozens of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/list-republican-senators-border-joe-biden-pressure-1578666" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other GOP lawmakers</a>, have been vocal in their criticism of how the Biden administration has handled immigration. Conservative cable news channel <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> has also doubled down on its immigration coverage since Biden’s inauguration, <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=%28border+OR+immigration+OR+immigrant%29&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20210120000000&amp;edt=20210811235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioning</a> “immigration,” “immigrant” or the “border” more than 39,000 times compared with fewer than 7,000 and 9,000 mentions on CNN and MSNBC, respectively.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran a search of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC coverage from Jan. 20 to Aug. 11 in the TV News Archive using the GDELT Television API. In that database, daily news footage is split into 15-second clips, and searches return the clips that contain a mention of our search query (“immigration” or “immigrant” or “border”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This strategy reflects just how much immigration has become a key issue for Republicans. What’s more, with a Democrat in the White House, Republicans are now more likely to be motivated by immigration, marking a shift in how much issues of race and ethnicity can motivate voters when their party is out of office.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take how strongly Trump supporters currently disapprove of Biden’s performance on immigration. Two <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/v60y11605p/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov polls</a> conducted <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/1aaz80mjhy/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in July</a> found that 84 percent of Trump voters “strongly disapproved” of how the president was handling immigration. That’s the highest level of disapproval of any of the 15 issues The Economist/YouGov asked about in <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/w1um475jkt/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/w2zmwpzsq0/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/1aaz80mjhy/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/v60y11605p/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> in July.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Trump voters really don't like Biden's immigration policy" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ceQIF/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="538" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Republicans don’t just disapprove of the job Biden is doing on immigration, though. Data from <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/immigrants_citizenship?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Independent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civiqs’s daily tracking polls</a> shows that Republicans — and to a lesser extent independents — have grown less willing to support a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. Since Election Day 2020, Republicans’ support for deporting unauthorized immigrants has increased by 12 percentage points while independents’ support has ticked up 8 points. It’s because of these increases that overall support for deportations is the highest it's been since Civiqs first asked the question in December 2016.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Support for deportation is ticking up among Republicans" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NQ1yp/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Civiqs isn’t the only pollster to document this trend either. Polling from the Pew Research Center has also found that the share of Republicans who oppose finding a legal way for unauthorized immigrants to stay in the U.S. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/05/03/most-americans-are-critical-of-governments-handling-of-situation-at-u-s-mexico-border/pp_2021-05-03_immigration_00-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased by 9 points</a> between June 2020 and April 2021. And <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-republicans/republicans-hostility-grows-toward-illegal-immigrants-as-party-attacks-biden-on-border-idUSKBN2B919J" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos</a> pointed to an even sharper uptick — an 18-point increase in the share of Republicans who opposed a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants — from 2018 to February 2021. Overall, Republicans are just a lot more likely to say <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/05/PP_2021.05.03_immigration_00-05.png?w=620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal immigration poses a very serious problem</a>, up from 43 percent in 2020 to 72 percent in April.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, this trend fits within a familiar pattern in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111666?origin=crossref&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political science research</a> arguing that public opinion often <a href="https://themonkeycage.org/2010/06/the_public_is_a_thermostat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operates as a thermostat</a>, whereby the public shifts against the current president’s positions to prevent policy-making from becoming too liberal or too conservative. On immigration, for instance, Americans’ opinions moved sharply to the left in response to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/5/17527734/trump-immigration-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s restrictive rhetoric and policies</a> — this was the case especially <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-democrats-win-on-immigration-policy-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among Democrats</a>. Just as with a thermostat, though, public opinion is now reacting to the warmer environment on immigration under Biden by growing cooler toward it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These recent pendulum swings on immigration, however, mark a potentially noteworthy departure. Thermostatic trends in Americans’ views about race and ethnicity have <a href="https://pages.uncc.edu/mary-atkinson/wp-content/uploads/sites/619/2014/02/BeyondThermostat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically been weaker</a> than Americans’ reactions to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/7/18656441/policy-mood-liberal-stimson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidents’ economic policies</a>. But that was <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691176192/white-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before immigration became such a deep dividing line</a> between Democrats and Republicans. Now, with the two parties <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-became-stuck-on-immigration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushing harder in opposite directions</a> on immigration than they have in the recent past, immigration has emerged as an important political issue with significant policy consequences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the Trump administration was frequently criticized for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-politics-immigration-united-states-a5bfcbea280a468b431a02e82c15a150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its strict immigration policies</a>, like separating children from their migrant parents, banning travel from predominantly Muslim countries and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/891563635/trump-administration-rejects-1st-time-daca-applications-violates-scotus-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limiting protections</a> for unauthorized immigrants brought to the country as children, which pushed Democrats further to the left on immigration. Likewise, the criticism that the Biden administration is not doing enough to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/briefing/sedition-miami-beach-curfew-astrazeneca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure the U.S.-Mexico border</a> with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/12/politics/us-mexico-border-migrants/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of migrants crossing the border</a> at a two-decade high is pushing Republicans further to the right on immigration. That growing hostility is likely to be a motivating factor in Republican politics throughout Biden’s presidency. From the earliest days of Trump’s presidential campaign, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/how-anti-immigrant-attitudes-are-fueling-support-for-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-immigrant sentiments fueled</a> his rise to the top of the Republican Party. They also <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/653374/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped move</a> some of then-President Barack Obama’s 2012 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/83/1/91/5494625?login=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporters to vote for Trump</a> in the 2016 general election. Republicans’ rising concerns about Trump’s signature policy issue of immigration should, therefore, only solidify his stranglehold on the GOP in the Biden era. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden’s decision in April to withdraw American combat troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11 <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/afghanistan-updates-chaos-kabul-airport-worlds-response/story?id=79474962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set in motion a collapse of the Afghan government</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/14/world/asia/afghanistan-maps-taliban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accelerated in recent weeks</a>. The Taliban have now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taliban-takeover-afghanistan-what-to-know-1a74c9cd866866f196c478aba21b60b6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seized back control</a> of the country as Americans evacuate and Afghans are left to face the grim aftermath.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not the ending to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/us/politics/biden-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-year “forever” war</a> Biden promised. But it’s hard to say just how harshly Americans will judge Biden for what’s happened. That’s because Americans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/26/will-foreign-policy-be-a-major-issue-in-the-2016-election-heres-what-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to not care a great deal about foreign policy</a>, and, moreover, most Americans previously supported Biden’s decision to pull troops out of Afghanistan. That said, even if most Americans want out of Afghanistan, it’s possible that they don’t like how it’s unfolded and Biden’s overall approval does take a hit as a result — it’s already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the lowest point of his presidency</a>. But it’s not clear that that will happen. There is simply a lot that is still unknown, and given that this is a fast-changing story, it’s hard to know what the lasting repercussions for domestic politics will be<strong> </strong>at this point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least until the events of this weekend, though, Americans supported Biden’s decision to remove U.S. military forces from Afghanistan. Most polls conducted since the beginning of July show that a sizable majority of Americans supported Biden’s decision, as the table below shows. But as the latest poll from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/16/afghanistan-withdrawal-taliban-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult</a> conducted over the weekend suggests, that could be changing.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the first poll conducted over the past weekend — after the imminence of the Taliban’s takeover became apparent — <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/16/afghanistan-withdrawal-taliban-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult</a> found a decline in support for withdrawing troops and an increase in opposition to the withdrawal. In the survey, 49 percent of registered voters supported the decision to remove troops, while 37 percent opposed it, a shift from the pollster’s <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/07/14051637/2107045_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous survey in early July</a>. Additionally, 51 percent said they disapproved of Biden’s handling of the situation in Afghanistan and <a href="https://twitter.com/MorningConsult/status/1427363282135011328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 25 percent</a> felt the withdrawal was going well. While we’ll have to see what polls show in the coming days, this survey suggests at least some backlash to the Biden administration’s approach.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it’s possible Americans won’t penalize Biden all that much for what’s happened in Afghanistan because, outside of <a href="https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/upload/electoralcostofwar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some major conflicts</a>, foreign policy doesn’t usually weigh heavily on voters’ minds. Foreign policy is a critical matter — events in recent days have reminded us of the serious implications of the U.S.’s decisions — but the reality is that for years Americans have paid <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/afghanistan-war-memory/396701/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very little attention</a> to the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Additionally, Americans’ perspectives on the Afghanistan conflict are mixed, with <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/352793/americans-split-whether-afghanistan-war-mistake.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup recently finding</a> about an even split on the question of whether it was a mistake for the U.S. to send troops in the first place. After 20 years in Afghanistan and the unpopular war in Iraq, Americans are <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2019/09/do-americans-really-want-end-forever-wars-survey-says/159760/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skeptical of intervening militarily</a> in foreign countries — <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/564824-poll-75-percent-say-us-should-not-get-involved-after-haitian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even for humanitarian reasons</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One thing that does seem likely, however, is that opinions of Biden’s handling of Afghanistan will become more polarized by party. We’re already seeing this with the new Politico/Morning consult survey: Net support for the withdrawal among Democrats was +53 (69 percent supported it, 19 percent opposed) while GOP net support was -27 (31 percent supported it, 58 percent opposed). And it’s possible Republican attitudes on Afghanistan may shift farther away from Democratic ones. Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/foreign-policy-doesnt-usually-affect-elections-could-iran-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to follow cues</a> from elites in their parties on foreign policy issues, and at this point, Republicans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/16/republicans-criticize-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are going on the attack</a>. Both the hawkish wing of the party and the more Trumpian isolationist faction <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/16/1028081817/congressional-reaction-to-bidens-afghanistan-withdrawal-has-been-scathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are criticizing Biden</a> for what’s happened, even though many Republicans, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/04/973604904/trumps-deal-to-end-war-in-afghanistan-leaves-biden-with-a-terrible-situation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including former President Donald Trump</a>, wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan. So it’s possible <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-really-really-dislike-biden-but-its-not-just-about-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what little standing Biden enjoyed among Republicans</a> overall could further erode. Democrats, on the other hand, are unlikely to break with Biden even if more of them now disapprove of the withdrawal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the whole, we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-should-still-pay-attention-to-joe-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t expect</a> to see a big shift in Biden’s approval rating, given just how polarized American politics are. But it’s also impossible to currently ascertain the longer-term consequences of the Taliban’s takeover, such as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/15/afghanistan-taliban-terrorist-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential increase in terrorism</a>. It’s possible that what’s happened in Afghanistan will dominate headlines for weeks to come, but even that’s uncertain. After all, <a href="https://twitter.com/rp_griffin/status/1427322936038416385?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American news coverage of Afghanistan has surged before</a>, only to quickly evaporate. And even if the spotlight stays on the crisis in Afghanistan, that doesn’t necessarily mean Biden will lose ground in approval. Consider a common comparison the media has made in recent days: the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/08/15/saigon-fall-kabul-taliban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall of Saigon</a> (now Ho Chi Minh City) in April 1975 in South Vietnam to North Vietnamese forces, a similarly chaotic moment of defeat for the U.S. at the end of the Vietnam War. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/23995/gerald-ford-retrospective.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a Gallup poll</a> taken before North Vietnamese troops took control of the city, then-President Gerald Ford’s approval rating was 39 percent, and it was 40 percent in a survey taken right afterward. And <a href="https://twitter.com/DKarol/status/1427272244275908618?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this was at a time</a> with a substantially less polarized electorate and many more swing voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/bin-laden-2001-end-war-afghanistan/619767/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">But fairly or not</a>, the reality is that Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/15/us/politics/afghanistan-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will now likely be associated</a> with the ugly end of America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, which ultimately failed to build a stable democratic regime. At this point, though, it remains to be seen just how that will influence overall public opinion toward Biden and his presidency.</p>]]></description>
