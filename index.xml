<p data-paragraph="main">Before the revelations, George Santos was the type of fresh face the Republican Party would have put front and center. The representative-elect is Latino, openly gay and just 34 years old. And by winning the election in New York’s 3rd Congressional District last year, he appeared to have cracked the code to succeeding as a Republican on Democratic-leaning turf.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But now, Republicans seem to want nothing to do with Santos. Last month, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/nyregion/george-santos-ny-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world learned</a> that he <a href="https://forward.com/news/529130/george-santos-jewish-lie-genealogy-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fabricated much of his biography</a> and may have broken U.S. and Brazilian law. Santos <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/26/rep-elect-george-santos-admits-fabricating-key-details-of-his-bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now admits</a> that he did not graduate from college, never worked at Citigroup or Goldman Sachs, does not own 13 properties and is not Jewish. In addition, he is still in arrears for unpaid rent from several years ago, did not fully disclose the source of his income on his personal financial disclosure forms and was accused of check fraud as a 19-year-old in Brazil. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All these questions about Santos’s past have begotten other questions — about his place in Congress and political future. Here’s our best shot at answering three of them.</p>



<h2><strong>Would Santos have won if voters had known the truth?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many people believe Santos was elected under false pretenses. Some parts of his résumé were disputed before the election by the <a href="https://www.theleaderonline.com/single-post/santos-filings-now-claim-net-worth-of-11-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Shore Leader</a> and the <a href="https://dccc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/George-Santos-Research-Book.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee</a>. But the story only got widespread attention when The New York Times blew the lid off it in December. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, it’s unclear whether he would have lost if his lies had been exposed earlier. We know that, theoretically, the district has enough Democratic voters to have defeated Santos. According to <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Kos Elections</a>, President Biden carried New York’s 3rd District<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new, post-redistricting version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> in 2020 by 8.2 percentage points. But many of those voters were nowhere to be found in 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It turns out, Santos didn’t do unusually well for a Republican in the district. The district voted red up and down the ballot. According to data from Democratic strategist <a href="https://twitter.com/BenJ_Rosenblatt/status/1604938859791486976?s=20&amp;t=ZcixK2XklTs4Ibea17Yilw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BenJ_Rosenblatt/status/1604997023605919746?s=20&amp;t=ZcixK2XklTs4Ibea17Yilw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosenblatt</a> and the <a href="https://vote.nyc/page/election-results-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City Board of Elections</a>, Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin carried the 3rd District by 12 points.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;56 percent to 44 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> And Republican Senate candidate Joe Pinion carried the district by 4 points.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;52 percent to 48 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> And Pinion’s margin within the district represents a scenario where the Republican candidate was much weaker than the Democratic candidate: Pinion raised a pitiful <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2NY00499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$589,000</a> for the race, while his opponent, powerful Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S8NY00082/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$41.8 million</a>. Of course, Pinion didn’t have Santos’s allegations swirling around him.<br><br>FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver previously calculated that scandals, on average, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-scandals-hurt-candidates-running-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shave 9 points off sitting House members’ margins</a> in general elections and 13 points in competitive districts. Santos’s winning margin in 2022 was just 7.5 points.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it should be noted that Santos was not a sitting House member at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> But a scandal’s impact varies quite a bit from election to election. So we can’t just subtract 9 points from that margin and assume that would have been the result if voters had been aware of his deceptions. Historically, some scandal-plagued candidates have underperformed by more than 30 points, while others have actually done <em>better</em> than expected. What’s more, in this era of high partisan polarization, scandals may hurt candidates <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisanship-often-trumps-scandal-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than they used to</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Will Santos resign?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the reality is that Santos <em>was</em> elected and took his seat in the House this week. Many people have called on him to resign, but historical trends suggest he may try to ride the scandal out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I maintain a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ksBLxRR3GCZd33IvhkcNqqBd5K8HwlWC7YuAkVmS1lg/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database of political scandals</a> and their impacts on politicians’ careers. Since 2017, 87 federal and statewide office-holders have been credibly accused of illegal or unethical activity, and only 17 have resigned.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one of the politicians who resigned, former Rep. &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-devin-nunes-is-resigning-from-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Devin Nunes&lt;/a&gt;, did so to take another job, not because of any fallout from the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> Another two were removed from office, though this probably won’t happen to Santos: It takes a two-thirds vote of the House to expel a representative, and it’s unlikely that dozens of Republicans will vote to potentially shrink their already-narrow majority.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/number-shape-republicans-politics-2023-fivethirtyeight-95905408</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t necessarily mean Santos will get off scot-free. Another nine of these scandal-plagued candidates chose not to run again,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though this number includes former Sen. Richard Burr, who was &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/senator-dumped-up-to-1-7-million-of-stock-after-reassuring-public-about-coronavirus-preparedness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;accused of insider trading&lt;/a&gt; only &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; he had already announced his retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a> and another 23 of them lost reelection or failed in a bid for higher office. Santos has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/28/george-santos-kevin-mccarthy-house-speaker-00075706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly told</a> local Republican leaders that he will not seek reelection. But if he were to run again, Santos would face a brutal reelection campaign in 2024 in his Biden-voting district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some scandals are more severe than others and may be more likely to lead to dire consequences for a person’s political career. But let’s look at politicians in situations similar to Santos’s. At least three other sitting or aspiring U.S. House members have been accused of embellishing their résumé in recent years.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be more I missed, since lying about your accomplishments doesn’t always rise to the level of legal or ethical wrongdoing required to make my scandal database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> First, former Rep. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/be1b8901aba5454ca346ea48e5d870f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Watkins</a> claimed to have founded a company he merely worked for and was accused of <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/local/2020/07/14/congressman-steve-watkins-charged-with-felonies-regarding-alleged-voter-fraud/114876772/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voter fraud</a> and making <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/10/26/steve-watkins-gop-candidate-for-congress-confronts-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct/9438705007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwanted sexual advances</a>. He lost reelection. Former Rep. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-resume-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Ratcliffe</a> falsely claimed he prosecuted a terrorist case as a U.S. attorney. As a result, he had to initially withdraw from consideration to be director of national intelligence under former President Donald Trump. But Trump nominated him again and he won Senate confirmation. And then there’s <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-jacobs-resume-20180327-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sara Jacobs</a>, who said she was a State Department “policymaker” even though she was a contractor who did not make actual policy. She won her election and is still in Congress today. </p>



<h2><strong>Who would win a special election to replace Santos?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Santos does resign (or is expelled), a special election would be held in New York’s 3rd District to choose a successor. Under <a href="https://casetext.com/statute/consolidated-laws-of-new-york/chapter-public-officers/article-3-creation-and-filling-of-vacancies/section-42-filling-vacancies-in-elective-offices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York law</a>, the governor must announce the date of the special election within 10 days of the vacancy, and the election itself would be between 70 and 80 days after that. So if Santos were to resign today, the special election would be in late March or early April.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ahead of the 2022 election, New York’s 3rd District had a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean. Partisan leans have not yet been updated with the results of the 2022 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> of D+4. That means, in a theoretically neutral political environment where the nation is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, we would expect Democrats to win the seat by 4 points. But of course, D+4 is still highly competitive, and it wouldn’t take much for Republicans to win. (Just ask Santos himself — or Zeldin, or Pinion.) In November, the national political environment leaned Republican by about 2 points,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans won the House popular vote by &lt;a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/charts/house-charts/national-house-vote-tracker/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;about 3 points&lt;/a&gt;, but Democrats left more seats uncontested than Republicans did, so that margin slightly overstates Republicans’ nationwide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a> and it may shift toward Republicans or Democrats by the time a special election is held.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, Republicans or Democrats could overperform by running a strong campaign, which could come down to the quality of the nominees. Unlike some other states, New York doesn’t hold primaries for special elections; instead, leaders in each party will choose their nominees. That means each candidate will probably be a party insider — someone unlikely to have the same baggage as Santos or the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/candidate-quality-mattered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other flawed candidates</a> Republicans nominated in the 2022 midterms. That could lead to a highly competitive, tooth-and-nail fight where neither party begins with the advantage. Of course, if Santos does resign, we’ll have much more to say about the special election once we know when it will be and who is running.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The 20 Republicans who opposed Kevin McCarthy’s bid for speaker of the House had something in common before Tuesday’s drama: They are very conservative and scorn the Republican Party establishment.<br><br>As you probably know by now, the 118th Congress began on Tuesday, and the election for speaker of the House — usually a mere formality — failed to produce a first-ballot winner for the <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-Multiple-Ballots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first time since 1923</a>. McCarthy needed a majority of the votes cast — in this case, 218. Since the GOP’s majority in the new House is just 222 members compared with the Democrats’ 212, McCarthy could afford only four defections from within the Republican caucus (assuming all Democrats voted against him). Last month, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-speaker-kevin-mccarthy-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we identified six Republicans</a> who had publicly come out against McCarthy, so we had an inkling that this vote would be tight. But then, on the House floor on Tuesday, a whopping 19 Republicans voted against McCarthy on the first and second ballots. And then Rep.-elect<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are technically no sitting U.S. representatives until a speaker is elected because the speaker has to swear in the new members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> Byron Donalds joined them on the third ballot to make an even 20.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the number was somewhat surprising, the roster of McCarthy’s opponents wasn’t. The Republicans who voted against him were, on average, more conservative than 98 percent of the 117th Congress (if they served in it) and more anti-establishment than 93 percent, according to <a href="https://voteview.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DW-NOMINATE</a>, a political-science metric that uses roll-call votes to measure the ideology of members of Congress.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they don’t yet have voting records, newly elected members of Congress don’t have DW-NOMINATE scores yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> (The first dimension of DW-NOMINATE quantifies how liberal or conservative a politician is and the second dimension corresponds to how closely aligned they are to the party establishment.) In other words, the faction that rebelled against McCarthy was ultraconservative and clearly uninterested in handing power to a man who has been part of House GOP leadership since 2009.</p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean. Partisan leans have not yet been updated with the results of the 2022 election.</p>
 <p>The first dimension of DW-NOMINATE quantifies how liberal or conservative a politician is and the second dimension corresponds to how closely aligned they are to the party establishment. Percentiles are based on how conservative and anti-establishment the members were within the 117th Congress. Newly elected members do not have DW-NOMINATE scores.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, unlike the Democrats who voted against former Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019 — who hailed exclusively from competitive districts — McCarthy’s foes tend to come from solidly red turf. Only three of the 20 were elected in districts with <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan leans</a><a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> bluer than R+15, suggesting they aren’t opposing McCarthy for electoral reasons. In addition, 14 of the 20 belong to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/20/house-freedom-caucus-what-is-it-and-whos-in-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Caucus</a>, an obstructionist group within the House aligned with the tea party. And it’s likely that after the House gets organized, at least some of the newly elected anti-McCarthy voters, Reps.-elect Josh Brecheen, Eli Crane, Anna Paulina Luna and Andy Ogles, will join the House Freedom Caucus since the group’s PAC endorsed each of them.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There were a few surprises in Tuesday’s vote, though. First, Ogles’s vote against McCarthy was a reversal of his previous position. In September, he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/12/kevin-mccarthy-house-speaker-bid-00056090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Politico</a> that he planned to support McCarthy, who had “earned the right to lead the caucus.” And Rep.-elect Mike Collins went the opposite direction. The conservative Georgian, also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/02/new-class-combative-maga-candidates-poised-roil-house-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported by the Freedom Caucus’s PAC</a>, pledged at the start of his campaign to <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/09/17/mike-collins-launches-10th-congressional-district-bid-in-trumps-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote against McCarthy for speaker</a>, but he broke that promise on Tuesday. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were also several extremely conservative, anti-establishment Republicans who broke with their compatriots and voted for McCarthy, such as Reps.-elect Ken Buck, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Jim Jordan. Greene has been a defender of McCarthy as she has attempted to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/09/marjorie-taylor-greene-maga-congress-mccarthy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build influence within the GOP</a>. Meanwhile, Jordan, the Freedom Caucus’s founding chairman, called for the party to come together while nominating McCarthy for speaker on the second ballot. His support was especially ironic since McCarthy’s 20 opponents voted for him on the third ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The question everyone has now, of course, is what happens next. McCarthy’s detractors are not softening their opposition. Indeed, they managed to grow their numbers between the second and third ballots. McCarthy, meanwhile, has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3796563-defiant-mccarthy-vows-to-fight-to-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insisted he will not step aside</a>. But that hasn’t stopped speculation that Republicans will eventually coalesce around a compromise candidate, like Rep.-elect Steve Scalise, who was slated to be McCarthy’s deputy. Given all we know, something will have to fundamentally change for the House to get a speaker anytime soon. We’ll find out if it has on Wednesday at noon Eastern Time when the House is scheduled to return.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/business/media/social-media-influencers-kids.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kidfluencers</a>” — children whose social media presence is followed and monetized — are a notable part of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2022/07/08/the-rise-of-the-influencer-predictions-for-ways-theyll-change-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing business</a> of social media. But this industry lacks protections for the children whose personalities and poses rake in an ever-growing amount of clicks and dollars. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since their inception, social media sites have largely evaded regulation. Even as the platforms have evolved into major sources of income for certain users — with some creators <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-instagram-influencers-earn-examples-2021-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making hundreds or thousands of dollars per post</a> — the law has not caught up to ensure that performers or consumers have the kinds of protections afforded to those in entertainment or advertising. But most Americans do want stronger protections: A YouGov poll from December 2022 found that a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/12/20/e82cd/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of Americans thought that child labor laws should extend to kids</a> who are social media influencers, while around two-thirds said that underage influencers are <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/12/20/e82cd/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploited by a parent or guardian</a> at least “somewhat” often. <br><br>While influencer culture is commonly associated with TikTok and Instagram today, it predates either platform. Monetizing content through ad placement became an <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/pressatgoogle.com/youtube5year/home/history-of-monetization-at-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">option on YouTube in 2008</a>, and nowadays, there is much more money in the game. Video ads may be common for YouTube, but brand deals and sponsored content rule the game on TikTok, as creators incorporate product placement into their posts. The size of the payouts depend on how large a creator’s audience is, which can be immense: On Instagram, high-profile influencers with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-instagram-influencers-earn-examples-2021-6?amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a million followers can make $250,000 for a single post</a>. The same can be said for online content featuring kids. What may have started out as family vlogs — sometimes referred to as “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/instagram-facebook-and-the-perils-of-sharenting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharenting</a>” — has evolved into a thriving economy of kid personalities. In fact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2022/01/14/the-highest-paid-youtube-stars-mrbeast-jake-paul-and-markiplier-score-massive-paydays/?sh=6d7704931aa7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Forbes</a>, two of the top 10 YouTube earners in 2021 were kid-forward accounts: Nastya, then a 7-year-old from Russia, made about $28 million through activity vlogs on YouTube, while 11-year-old American Ryan Kaji raked in roughly $27 million from his toy reviews and unboxing videos. And those figures only include money made directly through ads on the site, as brand deals (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-toys/six-year-old-youtube-star-brings-his-own-toy-line-to-walmart-idUSKBN1KK1IQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or even a toy line</a>) can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/18/ryan-kaji-9-earns-30m-as-this-years-highest-paid-youtuber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add millions more.</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of what has allowed the influencer economy to go so unregulated is that social media, more broadly, has largely gone unregulated. Instagram, for example, evolved from a casual picture-sharing app to a sponsor-laden online shopping hub, and laws addressing these changes have been slow to materialize, with political pressure starting to move the needle just <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/instagram-introduces-kid-safety-measures-after-congress-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a>. Still, most efforts to monitor and regulate social media have focused on <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political misinformation</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/epa-finally-addressing-4-dangerous-forever-chemicals-4000-95750270</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But protecting kidfluencers will take more than popular support, experts say. While polls like the one by YouGov show that the public is exhibiting a healthy amount of hesitation toward monetizing children’s online presences, the American legal system makes it hard to act on that concern, said Kimberly Rauscher, a professor of public and population health at <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/spph/kimberly-rauscher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boise State University</a> whose research focuses on professional working conditions in the U.S., especially those involving adolescents. Child labor laws can be complicated or convoluted, and legislation protecting child actors in the greater <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/04/hollywood-child-labor-law-california-permit-database-ignored-1202379257/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entertainment industry has been poorly enforced</a> for years. These laws are also enacted at the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/child-labor/entertainment#:~:text=Yes-,Sec.,employment%20in%20the%20entertainment%20industry.&amp;text=Title%2026%20Sec.,they%20must%20have%20work%20permits." target="_blank" rel="noopener">state level</a>, meaning there is a lack of consistency that doesn’t help with enforcement. For example, states like California and Alaska require work permits for underage workers, while Texas and Alabama don’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Power and money are used to squash regulations for certain industries or to obtain carve outs,” Rauscher said. She also said that politically driven decisions over time have made notable exceptions to child labor laws within some industries, such as agriculture. Closing those loopholes is touchy because it would involve the government monitoring and regulating what can be perceived as family work under parental supervision. That same complication arises with kidfluencers, who are typically under the purview, if not the complete management, of their parents or legal guardian, and a heavier legislative hand could be seen as crossing a family boundary line. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But most of all, the nature of influencer culture itself makes it difficult to implement and enforce regulations. The most successful brand deals and sponsored content, for example, do not appear to be obvious advertisements — a form of stealth advertising. That’s the motivation behind one of the few actual social media regulations, enacted by the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/1001a-influencer-guide-508_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Trade Commission</a> — noting that a sponsored post is sponsored — although the disclosure can be buried in a caption or <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23197348/tiktok-ad-sponcon-influencers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omitted without much punishment</a>. Still, the success of stealth ads is probably why some of the most successful TikTok accounts <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/charli-damelio-tiktok-teens/616929/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toe a line of ambiguity</a> — presenting brands and products in subtle ways. Because of this, it can be <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/child-influencers-exploitation-legal-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difficult for audiences</a> to know when a child’s presence is being monetized and when the kid is appearing in a video just for fun.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At present, one of the few global precedents for regulating kidfluencers came out of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54447491" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France in 2020</a>. This law set a limit on how many weekly hours children could work to make social media content, where their money went and how content could be taken down if kids featured in it made such a request.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the United States, there have been very few changes to child labor laws at all — let alone ones aimed at social media — since this new economy popped up, according to Rauscher. And the limited updates that have been made to child labor laws in this time — <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/esa/esa19981118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as updating the minimum age for driving motor vehicles</a> — don’t apply to the influencer ecosystem. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the public is concerned about these kids’ well-being, politicians largely aren’t, Rauscher said. She thinks that’s partly because there is little research into how working as influencers affects children. “Without the necessary science demonstrating the harm, there is little that can be done on the policy side,” she said. Meanwhile, the tide of young influencers continues to grow. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The-Influencer-Report-Engaging-Gen-Z-and-Millennials.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult study from 2019</a> found that 54 percent of 13-to-38-year-olds would, if given the opportunity, become an influencer. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats now have a slightly bigger Senate majority but not much to do with it. And so, it’s time for more judges.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Retaining the Senate means that President Biden and Senate Democrats will be able to continue nominating and confirming federal judges, and, if they play their cards right over the next two years, Democrats may get as many judges on the federal bench as Republicans did during former President Donald Trump’s term. If they get lucky, they could end up with even more.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="798" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-desktop.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-desktop.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-desktop.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-desktop.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1462" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-mobile.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-mobile.png?w=1340 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">As of Dec. 23, 94<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two judges, Florence Pan and Sarah Ann Leilani Merriam, were reappointed to appeals courtships and are counted twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> of Biden’s nominees have been confirmed to district and appellate courts — compared to 83 at this point in Trump’s presidency. And there are still plenty of positions left to fill. Right now, there are 79 open seats on the federal bench<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis excludes the Supreme Court, the federal circuit, and other specialty Article III courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> and 30 upcoming vacancies — this is when a judge announces they will retire at a future date. If Biden and Senate Democrats manage to fill all of those seats, there will be 203 Biden judicial nominee confirmations, compared to the 228 appointments Trump and Senate Republicans got through. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More could be coming, too. While fewer vacancies are likely to open up in the next two years, there are 85 Democratic-appointed judges who will be eligible to retire with full benefits in 2023 and 2024, according to data compiled by Brookings Institution fellow <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/russell-wheeler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russell Wheeler</a>.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some judges do not step down when they’re eligible, so it’s hard to predict how many of these seats will actually open in the next two years. Wheeler’s data is a conservative estimate of potential vacancies, since it doesn’t include any Republican-appointed judges, and some GOP appointees have already voluntarily stepped down under Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> Still, it’s very possible for Biden to match or even out-appoint Trump, since that estimate does not account for additional judges who may step down unexpectedly due to health or other factors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Right now, our analysis of data from the Federal Judicial Center shows that 11 percent of federal judges are Biden appointees and 26 percent are Trump appointees. (The rest were appointed by past presidents.) If Biden successfully fills all of the current vacancies, however, he will have appointed 20 percent of all federal judges. That shift is significant for demographic and political reasons. Trump’s appointees were overwhelmingly white and conservative, with traditional backgrounds for federal judges like private law practice and prosecution, while Biden is mostly nominating women and people of color who often come from nontraditional professional paths like public defense. If Biden takes advantage of the vacancies that are still open, his appointees could end up counterbalancing Trump’s — at least in some places. And that, in turn, could make the courts even more politically polarized.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In some ways, our courts are more divided than they’ve ever been,” said Chad Westerland, a political science professor at the University of Arizona who studies the federal courts. “You have judges that are coming from entirely different political ecosystems — and who will enact policies that follow the ideologies of the major national parties.”</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1356" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-3-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-3-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-3-mobile.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-3-mobile.png?w=1340 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden was always going to have a hard time matching Trump’s influence over the courts — and he needed a minimum of four years with a Democratic-controlled Senate to pull it off. This, experts told us, is due to the fact that the Republican-controlled Senate refused to confirm most of former President Barack Obama’s judicial nominees in 2015 and 2016, leaving Trump with 105 vacancies to fill. By contrast, Biden came in with 45 vacancies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good news for Biden is that over the past couple of years, a lot of judges have taken senior status — a form of quasi-retirement that opens up their seat — which has given him more vacancies to fill. That includes a decent number of Republican-appointed judges: Our analysis shows that 33 percent of the judges who have taken senior status under Biden were appointed by Republicans. That share is higher than the share of Democratic-appointed judges who took senior status under Trump, and it could be a sign that some Republican appointees who want to retire won’t bother holding out to see who wins the 2024 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the bad news for Biden is that the Republicans he’s replacing are mostly district court judges, which is a lower-impact judicial position. The more highly contested positions are on appeals courts, which have power over entire regions. So while Biden might be flipping plenty of district court seats, the courts with greater sway are still dominated by conservatives. That seems unlikely to change going forward: According to our analysis, only four Republican-appointed appeals court judges have taken senior status since Biden took office (and one of those judges was a holdover from former President Bill Clinton who was appointed by former President George W. Bush as part of a compromise, so she’s not <em>really</em> a Republican appointee), compared to 23 Democratic-appointed appeals court judges. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More bad news for Biden: His judicial impact thus far has been geographically limited. Those leftover vacancies from the Obama era gave Trump the ability to eventually appoint 104 judges in states that currently have at least one Democratic senator, while there are swathes of the country where Biden isn’t making any judicial inroads. Only eight of Biden’s appointees are in states with at least one senator of the opposing party. This trend is particularly pronounced among appeals court nominees: So far, Biden has only appointed three judges in states with at least one Republican senator, while Trump appointed 24 judges in states with at least one Democratic senator.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1062" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-2-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-2-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-2-mobile.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-2-mobile.png?w=1340 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">If anything, experts told us, Biden’s presidency is setting a new tone for how much a president can change the courts, particularly the appeals courts. During his term, Trump flipped control of three appeals courts from Democratic appointees to Republican appointees and made it difficult for Democrats to <em>ever</em> gain control of at least three others. So far, Biden’s impact has been more muted. He did flip control of the powerful Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in New York and handles many cases in the financial sector, from Republican appointees back to Democratic appointees, and will likely hand control of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals back to Democratic appointees next year. But Biden has yet to appoint a single judge to the Republican-dominated Eighth and Eleventh Circuits, which cover most of the South and Midwest, and he’s only appointed one judge to the hyper-conservative Fifth Circuit. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That, experts told us, isn’t likely to change meaningfully over the next two years, since Republican-appointed judges — especially appeals court judges — will largely try to avoid relinquishing their seats while Biden is in the White House. “Judicial appointments have gotten sucked into partisan political warfare, and if you’re a judge, how can you not be aware of that?” said Neal Devins, a professor of law and government at the College of William &amp; Mary. “We’re going to be increasingly moving into territory where there are red judge seats and blue judge seats, and without an unexpected illness or death, those safe seats will be very hard to flip.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1780" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-4-desktop.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-4-desktop.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-4-desktop.png?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-4-desktop.png?w=2048 2x"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1340" height="4284" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-4-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-4-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-4-mobile.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/atd.mejia_.BIDEN-COURTS-4-mobile.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s changes to the judiciary — even if they end up being more limited than Trump’s — will still be important for the people whose fates are decided in courtrooms around the country. Christina Boyd, a political science professor at the University of Georgia who studies the courts, said that even though district court judges don’t have the power to set the law for entire regions, their decisions on issues like sentencing are still consequential. Having more public defenders with reliably liberal ideologies serving as judges could mean fewer long sentences, and more skepticism of prosecutors’ claims generally. That’s a sharp contrast with the tough-on-crime perspective that Trump’s conservative appointees are likely to bring, and in that sense, could introduce some balance to a right-leaning judiciary. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But more broadly, the growing polarization in the courts will result in an increasingly wide gulf in the way Republican and Democratic-appointed judges interpret the law. “This whole notion that you can be treated equally by judges wherever you are — that’s just not the case,” Devins said. Whether a case is filed in the Democratic-controlled First Circuit or the Republican-controlled Fifth Circuit could make all the difference in how it turns out.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">What a year 2022 has been. There was so … much … news. We saw record-high inflation, war in Ukraine, a landmark Supreme Court session, continuing effects of the pandemic, the Winter Olympics, the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the World Cup and, of course, the midterms. In typical FiveThirtyEight fashion, we’ve been reflecting on 2022 the way we do best: through numbers. Here, seven of our reporters share some of the most important stats of the year, highlighting big political decisions, feelings of the electorate and hints at what’s to come in 2023.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<h2>Poverty</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In September, the U.S. Census Bureau released its annual supplemental poverty rate for the previous year. That’s the poverty rate after accounting for the impact of key government programs targeted at low-income families, among other things. For reporter and editor Santul Nerkar, the defining number of the year was <strong>7.8 </strong>percent, the supplemental poverty rate for 2021 and lowest rate on record. It was the first concrete measure of how COVID-19 stimulus money affected poverty in America. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/us-poverty-rate-hit-record-low-expect-stay-95391465</p>


<h2>Abortion</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In June, the Supreme Court released its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. In short order, many states enacted abortion bans, including total bans without exceptions for rape or incest. For senior writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, the defining number of the year was <strong>10,000</strong> — that’s how many fewer legal abortions there were in just the first two months after Roe v. Wade was overturned.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/number-captures-impact-dobbs-decision-fivethirtyeight-95627922</p>


<h2>Forever chemicals</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Per- and polyfluorinated chemicals, or PFAS, are used in all sorts of household products, from nonstick pans to dental floss. These pervasive chemicals are dangerous to human health, and the government and industry are finally starting to crack down on them. That brings us to senior science reporter Maggie Koerth’s numbers of the year: <strong>four</strong>, the number of PFAS the Environmental Protection Agency released new guidelines for, and <strong>4,700</strong>, the rough number of different PFAS chemicals out there.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/epa-finally-addressing-4-dangerous-forever-chemicals-4000-95750270</p>


<h2>Election deniers</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Denying the results of the 2020 presidential election was the cornerstone of many Republican campaigns this election cycle. Election denial is hardly a new thing, but it reached unprecedented levels in the 2022 midterms. That’s why <strong>47</strong> is the defining number of the year for politics and tech reporter Kaleigh Rogers. It’s the percentage of Republican candidates who ran for House, Senate, governor, secretary of state and attorney general this year and didn’t accept the legitimacy of the 2020 election.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/number-election-denying-republicans-defined-2022-midterms-fivethirtyeight-95710927</p>


<h2>Inflation</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into the midterm elections, Americans told pollsters that one issue was their top priority: the economy and inflation. For senior writer Monica Potts, the <strong>9.1</strong> percent inflation rate in June topped her list of most important stats of the year. Here she explores the ways — big and small — that historic levels of inflation affected American lives in 2022.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/inflations-41-year-high-impacted-american-life-fivethirtyeight-95850805</p>


<h2>The Republican margin in the House</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The results of the 2022 election were worse for Republicans than one might expect, given that the president’s party usually loses ground in the midterms. In the U.S. House, Republicans gained a majority but only a slim one. They won by only <strong>nine</strong> seats, which for editor Maya Sweedler is one of the most important numbers of the year. What Republicans will — and won’t — be able to do with that majority will define American politics for at least the next two years.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/number-shape-republicans-politics-2023-fivethirtyeight-95905408</p>


<h2>Democratic trifectas</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Congress divided between Democrats and Republicans after the 2022 midterms, some of the most important political shifts of the next few years could be coming at the state level. Those new policies might lean liberal because, for the first time in 12 years, more Americans will live in states totally controlled by Democrats than by Republicans. That’s why senior elections analyst Nathaniel Rakich picked <strong>140 million</strong> as his defining stat of the year. It’s the number of Americans who will soon be living in a state where Democrats will have total control over state government. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A few weeks before the midterms, I attended an election-denying group’s Zoom meeting. There had been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/stop-steal-supporters-train-thousands-us-poll-observers-2022-10-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alarming reports of a massive, well-funded campaign</a> to place election deniers in voting centers that could cause havoc on Election Day. I wanted to know exactly what these groups were telling these volunteers, so I found one in Pennsylvania and quietly attended an open session. What I heard that night surprised me. The training session provided would-be poll watchers with accurate, useful information about the responsibilities and limits of their role. It was more bureaucratic than baleful. And the threat of an army of conspiracy-minded meddlers interfering in the voting process never materialized: There were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/08/us/voting-polls-ballots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few reports of disruptions</a> on Election Day and no widespread internal efforts to hinder the voting or counting process. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, was this a win for democracy? On the one hand, free and fair elections form the bedrock of most people’s idea of democracy, so it’s, y’know, cool that there was no sinister behavior from conspiracy-minded poll watchers. On the other hand, groups that, with the encouragement of former President Donald Trump, tried to overturn the last election were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/stop-steal-supporters-train-thousands-us-poll-observers-2022-10-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting and training volunteers</a> to oversee this one, which isn’t very reassuring. Elsewhere, there were threats that never materialized, extreme candidates winning primaries but then losing general elections, candidates refusing to concede — but fewer of them than expected. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This mixed bag makes it difficult to gauge where democracy stands as we bid adieu to 2022. In the great ledger of wins and losses, did democracy wind up in the black this year? I spoke to three experts who told me, basically, yes. There were enough positive signals this year of democracy’s endurance that we should all be reassured. But they also all noted that threats remain, and while we should collectively take the W for democracy, we shouldn’t let our guard down as we head into 2023. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A lot of us saw this kind of doomsday scenario coming where politicians just stopped conceding their losses and democracy in that case becomes pretty unworkable,” said Ryan Enos, a government professor at Harvard University. “We’ve only had one election since Trump started forcefully denying the election in 2020 but if you’re going to project out, it looks like 2020 was more of a blip and that wasn’t something that was becoming the norm. And that should make us feel a lot better about election denial.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past two years, American democracy has faced <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/wilmington-massacre/536457/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed</a> threats. The most obvious has been Trump’s crusade to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which inspired the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and led 147 Republican federal lawmakers to refuse to certify some of the results of that election. Lawmakers then <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a historic number</a> of laws restricting voting in dozens of states, often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-big-lie-voting-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicitly in response to fears around election fraud</a>. Election workers faced <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/campaign-of-fear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threats of violence and harassment</a> like they’d never seen before. And to top it all off, hundreds of candidates who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran for office in 2022</a>, including for positions that hold meaningful authority over running elections and certifying their results. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this made for a pretty grim outlook on democracy at the beginning of 2022. Experts <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-11-17/democracy-threats-crisis-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/threats-to-american-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sounded</a> the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/five-biggest-threats-our-democracy-faces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alarm</a> over the ongoing threats and warned of a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/01/1059896434/united-states-backsliding-democracy-donald-trump-january-6-capitol-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terrifying drift</a> toward authoritarianism. But by the time the midterms finally came to a close, a number of signs reassured us that democracy in America is resilient. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably (though it’s disturbing that it’s notable), the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/when-election-deniers-concede" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast majority of candidates</a> who lost their races in the November midterm elections conceded, including some of the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/trump-backed-doug-mastriano-concedes-pennsylvania-governor-race-rcna56993" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more extreme Republican candidates</a> who were poised to follow in Trump’s footsteps and refuse to accept an outcome where they lost. Though this is an admittedly low bar to clear, losers conceding their races is something experts believe to be essential to democracy. It’s also <a href="http://brightlinewatch.org/american-democracy-on-the-eve-of-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">something many believed</a> wouldn’t happen as widely in 2022, according to a survey conducted by Bright Line Watch, an academic group that studies democratic norms in the U.S. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The election also brought several other encouraging signs, like the fact that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rogers-democracy-on-ballot-1129/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters largely rejected candidates</a> who both denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election and were running for a position where they would have meaningful influence over elections. This happened even in states where Republicans won other statewide offices, suggesting that the rejection of anti-democratic candidates wasn’t simply a pivot away from the GOP. We also didn’t see widespread distrust in the outcome of the midterms like we saw in 2020, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/technology/midterms-election-misinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efforts from Trump and other right-wing influencers</a> to sow doubts yet again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this isn’t just a vibe — it’s been captured in polling. <a href="https://brightlinewatch.org/american-democracy-and-the-2022-midterm-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another survey from Bright Line Watch</a> following the election found that confidence in the results increased after the election, including among Republicans, while belief in widespread voter fraud continued to tick down. Back when Bright Line Watch asked Americans about their confidence in the 2020 election results immediately before and after the contest, they got significantly different answers, according to Gretchen Helmke, a political science professor at the University of Rochester and a co-director of Bright Line Watch.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“For Republicans, it just tanked,” Helmke said. “This time around, it went up slightly at the personal level and the state level, but the big story for me is that there was no downward change at the national level among Republicans, that seemed like really good news to me.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as I noted earlier, there were no widespread antics with the voting or vote counting process, as some feared. Part of that may have been due to election officials <a href="https://phillyda.org/news/law-enforcement-city-officials-prepare-for-every-vote-to-be-counted-on-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with law enforcement</a> to protect the process, according to Wendy Weiser, the director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “There was a dramatic mobilization to rein in the risk and build up the guardrails that was very effective,” Weiser said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t to say that democracy is fine forever. The experts I spoke to all said there remain threats to democracy, and that vigilance and shoring up safeguards — such as <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/12/13/schumer-says-he-expects-omnibus-to-include-electoral-count-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reforming the Electoral Count Act</a> — are just as important.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The type of threats that make populist forces gain traction, like underlying inequality and people feeling powerless, those probably haven’t gone away,” said Enos. “The fact that the lies gained traction was more of a symptom than a cause.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as far as 2022 is concerned, let’s take the W for democracy.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Here’s a prediction that 100 percent, absolutely, positively will come true: I will get something wrong in 2023. Here at FiveThirtyEight, we make a lot of predictions every year; some of them work out, but we can’t get every single one right. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We can, however, learn from our mistakes. That’s why I like to <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2014/12/2014-predictions-in-review-winning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write about</a> <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2015/12/what-i-didnt-expect-in-politics-in-2015.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything</a> <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2016/12/what-i-didnt-expect-in-politics-in-2016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I got</a> <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2018/03/what-i-didnt-expect-in-politics-in-2017.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrong</a> in the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-i-got-wrong-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-i-got-wrong-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 months</a>.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first mea culpa of this article: I didn’t do this the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> I do this for two reasons: First, they’re often unintentionally hilarious (and when you’re a politics reporter, sometimes you need a laugh); second, identifying my blind spots has helped me become a better analyst.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And there’s no shortage of material for this year’s installment. Let’s start with a tweet I wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1324723749736861696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nov. 6, 2020</a>, shortly after it became clear that Joe Biden had won the presidential race: “Congratulations to Republicans on their victory in the 2022 midterms!” This was obviously meant to be snarky but also to communicate a political tenet: that the president’s party almost always has a bad midterm election. Of course, that tweet wasn’t from 2022, but I also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made this argument</a> in January of this year. And for several months thereafter, my analysis was colored by my expectation that 2022 would be a good election year for Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As everyone knows by now, the midterms were a disappointment for Republicans. They won the House — but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-control-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only barely</a> (they gained just nine seats on net). Meanwhile, Democrats gained a seat in the Senate. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/140-million-americans-live-states-controlled-democrats-fivethirtyeight-95547189</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, I was overly confident in my early prediction. While it <em>is</em> true that the president’s party almost always has a poor midterm, there have been exceptions. And the 2022 midterms turned out to be one of these “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asterisk elections</a>,” thanks in no small part to the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization to overturn the constitutional right to abortion. This year I should have been more prepared for the possibility that the ruling could throw a wrench into the election, especially after a draft of the decision was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-could-strike-down-roe-v-wade-what-would-that-mean-for-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked in May</a>. And even after the decision, it took me a while to become convinced that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voter anger over Dobbs</a> would prove durable enough to last until Election Day. It wasn’t until <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1569331117777424384?s=20&amp;t=XSnzH3mycH9ZRQPGGGYJYw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fall</a> that I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revised my expectations</a> from a “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-virginias-and-new-jerseys-elections-could-suggest-a-red-wave-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red wave</a>” to a “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red ripple</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">My biggest mistake here was not realizing just how common an “asterisk election” actually is. I often quoted one key stat: that the president’s party had gained House seats in only two of the previous 19 midterm elections. But there were four other midterms where the president’s party lost fewer than 10 House seats — so what happened in 2022 isn’t <em>that</em> rare. I also neglected to remember that the president’s party had lost Senate seats in only 13 of the last 19 midterms. In other words, midterms like 2022 happen about a third of the time — way too frequently to count them out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I also spilled a lot of ink this year on <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional redistricting</a> — some of which I regret. In March, I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote an article</a> that said the redistricting process was almost over, and I went on to analyze the congressional maps that had been passed at the time as if they were final. “The House Map’s Republican Bias Will Plummet In 2022,” I declared. I estimated then that the House’s new median seat would have a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> from 1.0 to 1.9 percentage points more Republican-leaning than the nation as a whole.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That article was premature. It was another three months before the last state (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana</a>) finalized its map. In the meantime, New York’s congressional map was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down in court</a>, and Florida passed a map that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extreme-bias-of-floridas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exceeded partisan Republicans’ wildest dreams</a>. When the dust settled, the national congressional map’s long-standing GOP bias had <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely changed</a> — the median seat was 2.5 points more Republican-leaning than the nation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But then an interesting thing happened in the 2022 election: The congressional map benefited <em>Democrats</em>. Based on 2022 House results, the median seat<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona’s 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> actually voted 1.9 points more Democratic than the nation as a whole. You can add this to my list of misfires if you want, but I don’t think it disproves that the congressional map still has a Republican bias over the long term. This was a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-house-election-margin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly regionalized election</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/williamjordann/status/1598034662550650880?s=20&amp;t=MIvjufmoJo2G84_oOnLLUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turnout was higher</a> in safely Republican areas than in safely Democratic areas, skewing the national popular vote. (Democrats also left more seats uncontested than Republicans did.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/19/ohio-supreme-court-strikes-down-congressional-map-used-may-primary/9359835002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> must draw new congressional maps for the 2024 elections. And Republicans won a <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/11/09/republicans-headed-for-sweep-of-ohio-supreme-court-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of seats</a> on both states’ <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/2022-elections/2022/11/07/election-2022--north-carolina-supreme-court-races" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supreme courts</a> in the 2022 election. So the Republicans who control redistricting in those two states will likely be able to get away with strongly gerrymandered maps. As a result, I think the overall House map will return to helping Republicans again in 2024. (Probably.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the course of the year, I also whiffed on several individual elections. For instance, I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-who-will-win-the-gops-senate-primary-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought</a> Rep. Madison Cawthorn would survive his primary challenge. But his <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/madison-cawthorn-sexual-misconduct-allegations-patrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/madison-cawthorn-may-have-a-new-ethics-violation-to-handle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandals</a> caught up to him, and he lost 33 percent to 32 percent. I also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democracy-is-on-the-ballot-in-these-11-secretary-of-state-and-attorney-general-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> Rep. Jody Hice the favorite in the Republican primary for Georgia secretary of state. But Georgia Republicans surprised me by renominating incumbent Brad Raffensperger despite his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defiance</a> of former President Donald Trump. And when I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-special-election-in-alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first previewed Alaska’s special election for U.S. House</a> in June, Mary Peltola was the ninth candidate I mentioned. But she <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled off the upset</a> and won, becoming the first Democrat to win a statewide election in Alaska since 2008 and the first Alaska Native elected to Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few of my early general-election predictions aged like unrefrigerated mayonnaise too. In May, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-every-senator-and-governor-ranks-according-to-popularity-above-replacement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote</a> that Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak had a distinct personal brand that could help win reelection. It turns out not so much: Sisolak lost to Republican Joe Lombardo. I also predicted that the governor’s race in Rhode Island could be sneakily competitive. Instead, Gov. Dan McKee ended up winning by almost 20 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Closer to the election, I also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/wisconsin-senate-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penned an article</a> noting that Democrat Mandela Barnes was leading in the few polls there were of Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race. Well, the day the article was published, Barnes lost his lead in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average</a> and never regained it. Finally, after Hurricane Ian hit Florida, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hurricane-ian-desantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I was skeptical</a> that Gov. Ron DeSantis’s response would help him politically. But in fact, DeSantis’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average polling lead</a> went from 6 points on the day Ian made landfall to 12 points on Election Day, and he wound up winning by 19 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The prediction that hurt the most — at least, when it came to my post-election social life — wasn’t about who would win an election; it was about <em>when</em> someone would win it. In our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive guide</a> to election-results timing, published on Nov. 5, I wrote that we would likely know the winner of the election sooner than we did in 2020. How naive I was: It again took until the Saturday after Election Day for the networks to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-blue-nevada-means-democrats-will-keep-control-of-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project a winner in the Senate</a> — and eight days after the election for them to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-control-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project the House</a>. Oh, sweet Nov. 5 Nathaniel.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk, might not have any credibility as a pollster in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s rating system</a>, but he’s a pollster nonetheless. Kinda.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Soon after he took control of Twitter in October, the once-<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/12/elon-musk-is-no-longer-the-richest-person-in-the-world.html" target="_blank">richest person in the world</a> implemented a new management style that allowed users to make key decisions via polls. Should former President Donald Trump <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/20/donald-trump-back-on-twitter-elon-musk" target="_blank">be allowed to rejoin</a> the platform after supposedly being <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension" target="_blank">permanently banned</a> last year? A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593767953706921985" target="_blank">slim majority of users</a> said yes, so — “Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594131768298315777" target="_blank">as Musk wrote</a> — he was back. Should Musk bring back Vine, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-31/musk-polls-twitter-users-on-bringing-back-tiktok-precursor-vine" target="_blank">the short-form video app</a> which shut down in 2016? <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/elon-musk-might-bring-back-vine-a-predecessor-of-tiktok-shut-down-by-twitter.html" target="_blank">Sure! Maybe!</a> The people have spoken!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The stakes of the polls escalated quickly. On Sunday, Musk put his own job security on the line, vowing to abide by the results of his own, unscientific poll. “Should I step down as head of Twitter?” he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604617643973124097" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked users</a>. By Monday, he had an answer: By a 15-point margin — 57.5 percent to 42.5 percent — respondents said he should resign from his post atop the social media giant. Musk said on Tuesday he plans to honor the poll’s results as soon as he finds “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-says-hell-step-down-twitter-ceo-after-finding-replacement-2022-12-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">someone foolish enough</a>” to succeed him. It’s unclear when that will happen, or how much power he will <em>actually</em> be relinquishing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s too bad for Musk that he didn’t take a more scientific approach, though, because according to a number of professionally conducted polls, Americans still have a somewhat favorable opinion of him — although they do hold negative views of social media companies generally. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s kick things off with Musk’s own question of whether he should quit. Though a majority of respondents in his own survey said “yes,” an overnight poll conducted by <a href="https://mailchi.mp/harrisx.com/a-majority-of-americans-want-elon-musk-to-stay-on-as-twitter-ceo-finds-harrisx-overnight-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HarrisX</a> in mid-December found that a whopping 61 percent of U.S. Twitter users and 53 percent of U.S. adults actually want Musk to stay at the helm. Meanwhile, another December poll, this one from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3863" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a>, found that Americans were almost evenly split on their feelings toward how Musk runs the social media giant: 37 percent said they approved of the way he’s operating Twitter, 37 percent disapproved and 25 percent offered no opinion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And poll after poll shows that Musk isn’t <em>overwhelmingly</em> unpopular with the American public, either. According to that same Quinnipiac survey, 36 percent of Americans said they viewed Musk positively versus 33 percent who viewed him negatively. (Another 26 percent said they hadn’t heard enough about him to make an opinion either way.) A <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/h45mt3xoby/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist</a> poll, fielded in November, found that 41 percent of U.S. adults had a “very” or “somewhat” favorable view of Musk compared with 37 percent who viewed him “somewhat” or “very” unfavorably. These findings come despite evidence showing that, generally, Americans hold negative opinions about social media companies. Quinnipiac, for example, found that 70 percent think that social media giants like Twitter and Facebook “do more harm than good,” while 18 percent disagreed. Another spring 2022 survey from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/12/06/social-media-seen-as-mostly-good-for-democracy-across-many-nations-but-u-s-is-a-major-outlier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, which polled citizens in 19 advanced economies about their views on social media, technology and their influence on society, found that 79 percent of U.S. respondents believed that access to social media and the internet has made people more divided in their political opinions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that Musk isn’t overwhelmingly disliked might come as a surprise to people who have been closely following Twitter’s fate. In a matter of months, he <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/mass-exodus-from-twitter-confirmed-after-elon-musk-guts-staff-and-increases-workload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gutted the company’s staff</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/25/1139180002/twitter-loses-50-top-advertisers-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drove away major advertisers</a> and suspended (then unsuspended) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musks-twitter-suspension-journalists-draws-global-backlash-2022-12-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the accounts of several prominent journalists</a> — <a href="https://www.insider.com/elon-musk-takeover-twitter-controversies-antisemitism-blue-checkmarks-conspiracy-theories-2022-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among many other things</a>. And it’s worth underscoring that not everyone is over the moon with Twitter’s newest CEO. Per Quinnipiac, among U.S. adults, Republicans (63 percent) and white men (51 percent) were the most likely to view Musk favorably. Democrats (9 percent), Black respondents (17 percent) and women (25 percent) were the demographic groups <em>least</em> likely to harbor positive opinions toward Musk. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, to be sure, it does look like Musk’s overall favorability numbers have ticked down since purchasing Twitter. Back in April, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/wlken5wyfy/elon-musk-twitter-toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> found that closer to half of U.S. adults (49 percent) had a “very” or “somewhat” favorable opinion of Musk compared with 31 percent who viewed him “somewhat” or “very” unfavorably.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unfortunately, most polls that ask respondents their opinions toward Musk don’t ask <em>why </em>people feel the way they do. Is his wealth impacting people’s views of him? Is his <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/explore/public_figure/Elon_Musk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high name ID</a> giving him an added advantage? Did his suspension of journalists (which a majority of respondents in a December <a href="https://civicscience.com/immediate-insights-majority-of-americans-disapprove-of-elon-musks-decision-to-suspend-journalists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CivicScience poll</a> viewed negatively) depress his favorability ratings? Topline survey findings don’t give us a lot of clues. What we do know, however, is that people view Musk as an influential and successful businessman — and maybe someone who’s a bit quirky, too. And that might be why, despite his many flubs at Twitter, Americans don’t have overwhelmingly negative views of him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, YouGov’s April survey asked respondents how influential they felt Musk was in the tech world and the overwhelming majority of respondents (80 percent) said he was “very” or “somewhat” influential. Another question on the same polls asked the same sample to select terms that they felt described Musk. The winners were: rich (60 percent), an entrepreneur (49 percent), an innovator (39 percent) and eccentric (37 percent). Meanwhile, a December <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/12/20/09d47/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> survey found that 58 percent of U.S. adults believe that Musk is a “successful business person” versus 22 percent who said he wasn’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So have Twitter users actually seen the last of Musk, then? It doesn’t seem like he’s planning to bow out entirely — or even partially. After announcing that he would resign as CEO once he could find a sufficiently foolish successor, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1605372724800393216" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he said that his next steps</a> would be to “just run the software &amp; servers teams.” So the main change to Twitter — at least in the short-term — might be the way Musk conducts his polls (he seemed to agree with a user’s comment which suggested that, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-twitter-twitter-blue-poll-1849914080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from now on</a>, only Twitter blue subscribers should be allowed to vote in “policy related” polls). Or maybe Musk actually will step back and open the door for someone else — hello, <a href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1604656918844256257?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snoop Dogg</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dionnewarwick/status/1605362816386338816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dionne Warwick</a> — to take over at Twitter in 2023. Your guess is as good as mine.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Would you consider yourself a poor gift wrapper? If so, your humility might put you in the minority, according to new December polling data from <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/12/19/afad9/2">YouGov</a>. Per their survey, 64 percent of U.S. adults said they considered themselves to be either “very” or “somewhat” good at gift wrapping. Nineteen percent of respondents said they were somewhat bad at gift-wrapping, while another 11 percent said they were <em>very</em> bad at it. You’re also in the minority, per <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/12/19/afad9/3">YouGov</a>, if you’ve never regifted a present to someone else. Only about one-third of adult respondents (31 percent) claimed that they’ve never done so, but most admitted to doing it: 29 percent said they’ve regifted once or twice, 18 percent said they’ve regifted “several times” and 13 percent of respondents have regifted “many times.”</li><li>The end of the calendar year has also led certain national pollsters — <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/most-annoying-word-or-phrase/">Marist</a>, specifically — to find out which word or phrase U.S. adults find most irritating. This year’s winner/loser? “Woke.” <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_Word_202212131025.pdf">According to their survey</a>, about one-third of Americans (35 percent) agree that “woke” is the most annoying word used in conversation. Coming in second was the word “whatever” (22 percent), followed by “it is what it is” (15 percent). But while attacking “woke” and “wokeism” was initially the crusade-du-jour <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-attacking-cancel-culture-and-woke-people-is-becoming-the-gops-new-political-strategy/">by the GOP</a>, it appears that a number of survey respondents — regardless of party ID — found the term annoying. In fact, 31 percent of Democrats, 39 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of independent voters listed “woke” as the most bothersome word used in conversation. For context, 2021’s winners, <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/marist-national-poll-most-annoying-word-december-2021/">according to Marist</a>, were “Trump” and “coronavirus.”</li><li>With the 2022 midterm elections behind us, all eyes are now on the 2024 presidential race. And new polling data from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/12/21/2023-lookahead-republicans-to-determine-trumps-role-in-party-future/">Morning Consult</a> seemingly suggests that voters <em>might </em>be looking at another head-to-head matchup between Trump and President Biden (assuming the latter runs for reelection, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/10/joe-biden-2024-president-election">which looks increasingly likely</a>). On the Republican side, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/">Morning Consult’s tracking</a> among potential GOP primary voters<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> gives Trump a wide lead (48 percent) over potential competitors like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, (33 percent) former Vice President Mike Pence (8 percent), Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (3 percent) and others. Pitted directly against DeSantis, however, Trump has a harder time breaking through. When potential GOP primary voters were asked who they’d vote for in a primary election or caucus if it were held in their state today, 45 percent of respondents said DeSantis while 44 percent said Trump. Eleven percent said they didn’t know or had no opinion. </li><li>According to newly released survey data from <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/467303/americans-reported-mental-health-new-low-seek-help.aspx">Gallup</a>, Americans’ assessment of their own mental health is at an all-time low. Currently, just about 3-in-10 U.S. adults (31 percent) described their mental or emotional well-being as “excellent” — the lowest rating Gallup has recorded since it began asking respondents this question in 2001. The author notes, however, that part of the downward trend might be attributed to the COVID-19: Before then, Americans’ “excellent” ratings ranged in the 40s. Those numbers didn’t begin to tick down until late 2020; that year, the percentage of adults who felt that their mental health was in “excellent” condition dropped to the 30s for the first time at 34 percent. The demographic groups <em>least</em> likely to say that their mental health and emotional well-being were “excellent” were people between the ages of 18 and 34 (20 percent), people who made less than $40,000 annually (21 percent) and women (28 percent). </li><li>In a calendar year that featured a major election and the rippling effects of a global pandemic, which headlines stuck out most to Americans? According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/12/19/seen-read-heard-2022-analysis/">Morning Consult</a>, this year’s most salient news events, according to registered voters, were the Uvalde shooting (73 percent), the fall of Roe v. Wade (71 percent), Queen Elizabeth II’s death (71 percent) and Hurricane Ian (70 percent). But there was a partisan gap in news salience, too. While Democrats (78 percent) and independent voters (72 percent) both listed the Uvalde shooting — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/texas-school-shooting-victims-uvalde-robb-elementary/">which left 21 people dead</a> — as the top news event that they saw, heard or read “a lot” about, Republicans were more likely to put Hurricane Ian (70 percent) in the No. 1 slot. Among registered GOP voters, the Texas shooting ranked fourth (69 percent) after the hurricane, the fall of Roe (70 percent) and the queen’s death (70 percent). </li></ul>

<p data-paragraph="main">Last month, former President Donald Trump <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-2024-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his campaign</a> to return to the White House, more than a year before the start of the 2024 presidential primary process. So far, Trump is the only major Republican candidate who’s launched a bid.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies to &lt;a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/former-mt-secretary-of-state-announces-presidential-bid/article_7126a007-089a-5392-8390-f197d41fddb1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;former Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>19</sup></a> While his entry may deter some opponents from running, it’s unlikely Trump <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-draft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will have the GOP primary entirely to himself</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But just how long will we have to wait until someone decides to take on Trump? We took a look at open presidential primaries between 1980 and 2020 (meaning they didn’t feature an incumbent) and noted when every candidate either filed with the Federal Election Commission or announced their candidacy, whichever came first.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the modern presidential nomination process &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/reformingthepresidentialnominationprocess_chapter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;began in 1972&lt;/a&gt;, the FEC wasn’t created until 1974, so filing date isn’t an available metric for the ’72 cycle. We also excluded the next cycle because it wasn’t until &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/jimmy-carter-iowa-caucuses/426729/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jimmy Carter broke out in the 1976 Iowa Democratic caucuses&lt;/a&gt; that Iowa became so important. We included any candidates who filed with the FEC, even if they ultimately didn’t officially announce a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a>  (Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/15/1137052704/trump-2024-president-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did both on Nov. 15</a>.) Using this data, we compared how far in advance of the Iowa caucuses — the long-running first electoral stop — these candidates formally began their campaigns. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">About 3 in 4 primary candidates in this period launched their bids between 210 and 420 days before Iowa, with about 2 in 5 starting between 300 and 390 days (roughly 10 to 13 months) before voting began. To put that in context, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/09/1141588550/iowa-caucus-republicans-democrats-presidential-primary-elections-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans plan for Iowa to lead off</a> their 2024 nomination calendar — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/democrats-want-to-change-their-primary-calendar-it-wont-be-easy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlike Democrats</a> — and as the caucuses have traditionally taken place between early January and mid-February, we are now roughly 375 to 425 days <a href="https://www.frontloadinghq.com/p/the-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">away from them</a>. Based on the 210- to 420-day range, then, we might expect most of Trump’s eventual opponents to enter the race sometime between just after New Year’s and June 2023. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">While we’ve tried to comprehensively examine when candidates most commonly launch presidential bids, it’s worth pointing out that registering the exact date a campaign begins is far murkier than the date of an FEC filing or a formal announcement. In reality, prospective candidates take steps toward running well before making anything official, such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/us/politics/mike-pence-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gathering a stable of potential donors</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2015/01/13/rand-paul-president-political-staff/81583228/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identifying campaign staff</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ignore-what-potential-2024-presidential-candidates-say-watch-what-they-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaging in public activities</a> that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-7-signs-that-someone-might-be-running-for-president-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can signal a run</a>, such as visiting early-voting states like Iowa, publishing a book about themselves or campaigning on behalf of candidates in other elections. Presidential aspirants sometimes form an “exploratory committee” to test the waters before taking more official steps. But candidates <a href="https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/registering-candidate/testing-the-waters-possible-candidacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t have to register or report</a> this activity to the FEC until they formally become a candidate, so sometimes we initially learn of an exploratory committee’s formation only <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/jim-webb-2016-committee-113055" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because the candidate reveals it</a>, a move that can <a href="https://www.npr.org/2006/12/05/6581302/declaring-for-president-is-a-dance-of-seven-veils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garner a splash of media attention</a> before the candidate later makes an official announcement. And more recently, some candidates like Jeb Bush have had allied super PACs <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/jeb-bush-right-to-rise-super-pac-campaign-117753" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise gobs of money months before</a> the candidate officially enters the race, blurring the lines of what even counts as “exploratory.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Among the 15 primary candidates who eventually won the open-nomination races between 1980 and 2020, all but one began their formal campaigns at some point in that 210- to 420-day range. In 2016, for instance, Trump <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4583025/trump-coming-escalator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rode down the Trump Tower escalator</a> 230 days prior to Iowa’s caucuses.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all date calculations, day one is the day of the announcement or FEC filing, but the day of the Iowa caucuses is not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> In 2012, Mitt Romney <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2gY2Otr9Hk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced 215 days beforehand</a>, while in 2008 John McCain <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/933/26039272933/26039272933.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed with the FEC</a> 413 days ahead of caucus voting. Only Bill Clinton entered a primary less than 210 days out: He <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/P20000642/?cycle=1996&amp;election_full=true&amp;tab=filings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for the 1992 contest</a> just 178 days before Iowa, emblematic of that cycle’s late-developing campaign <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27551581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to the expectation</a> that the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/234971/george-bush-retrospective.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then-popular</a> President George H.W. Bush would be difficult to defeat. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the Clinton example shows how each cycle’s individual conditions can influence candidates’ decisions to launch. For instance, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the 2020 Democratic contest less than 90 days before the Iowa caucuses, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/deval-patrick-michael-bloomberg-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking to capitalize on concerns</a> about front-runner Biden’s strength as a candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Alternatively, an especially early entry is usually the mark of a relatively unknown contender looking to maximize their time to raise money and attract attention. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-first-2020-candidate-is-hold-on-i-had-the-name-right-here-john-delaney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared for the 2020 Democratic race</a> 920 days before Iowa — the record for the years we looked at — but he and most others who entered more than 420 days before voting began wound up winning very little support. That’s not always the case for early announcers — former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean (598 days) was once <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-dean-scream-what-really-happened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a leading contender</a> in the 2004 Democratic race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To this point, we can see how the 2024 cycle’s circumstances likely encouraged Trump to announce on the earlier side. His launch date will likely be more than 400 days ahead of Iowa’s vote, depending on the caucuses’ actual date. On the one hand, Trump’s situation is unprecedented in modern times: Since the current presidential primary system <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/reformingthepresidentialnominationprocess_chapter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took shape in the 1970s</a>, no former president has run again.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After losing in 1976, Gerald Ford &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/10/archives/ford-is-considering-race-in-1980-without-entering-state-primaries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;considered a comeback bid&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 but &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/16/ford-says-he-wont-be-a-candidate/110ef582-9dd8-414c-afe7-45c83e7ccac6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ultimately declined to run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>22</sup></a> But by getting in early, Trump not only made real <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/trump-running-president-2024-election/620502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unofficial campaign</a> that arguably dated back to his departure from the White House, but he also reportedly did so <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/15/trump-2024-announcement-running-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to deter</a> possible primary opponents and gain support from Republican leaders, who’ve <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/us/politics/trump-impeachment-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fallen in line behind him</a> in the past. (Trump may have also wanted to become an active candidate before state or federal officials potentially filed criminal charges against him in cases regarding the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/19/trump-referrals-jan-6-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-mar-a-lago-documents-possible-charge-justice-department-rcna56485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly retaining classified documents</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/17/politics/georgia-grand-jury-trump-2020-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interfering in Georgia’s 2020 electoral process</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether this approach will successfully discourage primary challengers remains to be seen. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/14/1142680625/will-desantis-run-2024-president-campaign-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismissed questions</a> about his presidential aspirations, but between his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/politics/ron-desantis-autobiography-president-2024/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming autobiography</a>, his continued fundraising and the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-midterm primary polling</a> that’s found him running ahead of Trump, it’d be surprising if he didn’t end up running. Still, <a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/politics/ron-desantis-presidential-run/67-30b16938-a528-4e04-a1b4-06bb1c52c428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeSantis may postpone his entry</a> until after Florida’s legislative session <a href="https://www.floridabar.org/member/legact/legact004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ends in early May</a>, which would be roughly 240 to 290 days before Iowa. By waiting, DeSantis can open his campaign by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/politics/ron-desantis-florida-what-matters/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trumpeting his conservative policy achievements</a>, including any additional ones passed by the GOP-controlled state Legislature in the upcoming session. But more fundamentally, DeSantis may want the Legislature to act before he runs to make it less costly for him to seek the presidency: Under Florida’s “resign to run” law, state officeholders <a href="https://news.wfsu.org/state-news/2022-12-02/florida-leaders-are-considering-a-change-to-the-resign-to-run-law-to-help-gov-ron-desantis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must resign their office</a> if they run for federal office, but Republican legislative leaders are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/22/florida-legislature-desantis-presidential-run-00070538" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering changes</a> to ease DeSantis’s potential presidential bid. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of DeSantis’s motivations for waiting, it wouldn’t be weird for a sitting governor to wait for the end of a state’s legislative session, at least before holding a public announcement. For instance, in 1999, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?124024-1/texas-governor-news-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George W. Bush</a> didn’t formally declare his candidacy <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4561795/george-w-bush-presidential-campaign-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until June</a>, following the <a href="https://lrl.texas.gov/sessions/sessionsnapshot.cfm?page=summaries&amp;legSession=76-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of Texas’s state-legislative session</a>, although he did <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/360/99034364360/99034364360.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file with the FEC</a> in March 1999 (reflected in the chart). In 2015, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal <a href="https://www.wafb.com/story/28589933/jindal-to-wait-after-legislative-session-to-make-presidential-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also waited</a> for the state-legislative session to conclude, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/24/417171327/louisiana-gov-bobby-jindal-announces-presidential-run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially launching his campaign</a> for the 2016 Republican primary about <a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/politics/elections/reports-bobby-jindal-to-announce-presidential-plans-june-24/67-236487651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two weeks after the state Legislature adjourned</a> (he <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/728/15031432728/15031432728.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed with the FEC</a> two days after announcing).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for other potential Trump opponents, the former president’s long shadow might push some aspirants to embrace a wait-and-see attitude. Former Vice President Mike Pence and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2022/12/14/mike-pence-visits-raleigh-2024-election-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been positioning</a> themselves <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-hogan-fundraiser-113022-20221130-r57upthc55d3bpiowmp5e5snzq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for possible runs</a>, but assuming Hogan doesn’t announce a bid before <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/maryland/maryland-governor-elect-wes-moore-inaugural-ceremony-jan-18-2023/65-08f82c6d-392f-4b8e-95e3-1c8e8cf24ee3" target="_blank">he leaves office</a> on Jan. 18, neither of them will have official duties that might influence their timing. Former U.N. Ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/us/politics/nikki-haley-united-nations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki Haley</a> and Texas Sen. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/22/659692611/from-lyin-ted-to-beautiful-how-trump-and-cruz-found-political-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ted Cruz</a> tried to cozy up to Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/23/last-month-nikki-haley-was-not-a-fan-of-donald-trump-now-shes-agreed-to-join-his-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after opposing</a> him <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/rnc-2016-donald-trump-unity-225915" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2016</a>, so they may be wary of challenging him, although Haley recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-donald-trump-south-carolina-12b85a32e670636e52e03d8d75d1e145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walked back a pledge</a> to support Trump in the 2024 primary. Others who may be looking to run, such as Texas Gov. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/11/17/greg-abbott-third-term-priorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Abbott</a> and New Hampshire Gov. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/us/politics/chris-sununu-trump-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Sununu</a>, could be influenced by the timing of their state-legislative sessions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, from the data we’ve examined here, we can see that the timing of Trump’s entry into the 2024 presidential race was fairly early compared with past presidential cycles, though by no means an obvious outlier. And once the new year rolls around, we should be on guard for further candidate announcements at any time. We have reason to suspect that DeSantis, Trump’s clearest potential rival, may wait until the late spring to announce, but that doesn’t mean some other possible contenders won’t enter in the meantime.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Lisa Ayala-Davis says she knew that the <a href="https://people.com/politics/why-midterm-polls-falsely-predicted-red-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls predicting</a> a red wave this year were mistaken. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I feel like I was the lone voice saying, ‘Democrats are not going to do as badly as the pundits are saying,’” Ayala-Davis, a 48-year-old Hispanic Democrat living in rural Georgia, told me. In fact, she was more shocked by Democrats’ perceived <em>underperformance </em>in certain states. “I was really surprised that [Republican] J.D. Vance won the U.S. Senate race in Ohio. I really thought [Democrat] Tim Ryan was going to pull it off.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis’s high hopes for the Democrats aside, it was a good year for her party. Although Republicans narrowly took control of the House of Representatives, Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skirted the sizable losses</a> that the president’s party tends to suffer in midterm races. Not only that, Democrats kept their Senate majority, even <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/democrats-pick-up-senate-seat-with-fetterman-win-over-oz-networks-01667974207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipping an additional Senate seat</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So with the 2022 cycle officially behind us, I wanted to close my Voices of Color column by checking in with five voters about how they’re processing the results — both in their home states and nationally. This year’s midterms left some voters, especially those who identified as Republicans, especially shocked. Mickey N., who asked us not to use his full name due to privacy concerns, compared Republican defeat to <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2014/10/the-history-of-lucys-pulling-the-football-away-from-charlie-brown-in-peanuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a shopworn metaphor</a> from Charlie Brown: Lucy pulling the football away from Charlie Brown’s foot just as he begins his kick, with Republicans, this time, left flat on their backs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Mitch McConnell had no plans, while Florida Sen. Rick Scott had a ‘comprehensive’ plan to tax half of America,” he said. “They just didn’t have a coherent message.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I also wanted to know how these voters of color are thinking ahead to the 2024 presidential election. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/politics/biden-trump-2024-poll/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a lot of the country</a>, my interviewees weren’t jazzed about a potential rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. But they still had draft boards of other candidates they’d like to see running for commander-in-chief. (I won’t spoil their answers, though. More on that lower down.) </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: What was the biggest factor motivating you to vote this year? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N. (26, Ohio, Hispanic, Republican): I think the two main driving factors behind my vote this year were the Jan. 6 insurrection and the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Republican Party’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis also made my life more difficult, as someone in the medical field. We had people who would come in and say they were being ‘forced’ to get the vaccine or falsely claim that there was a microchip in the vaccine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Liv Marshall (22, Oregon, Asian, independent): There were some personal things going on that factored into me casting a ballot this year. For one, I have family affiliated with Oregon’s state government, and they were very worried about the three-way governor’s race and how the splitting of the vote could potentially shake up the outcome. That was definitely a strong factor. Secondly, I was more motivated to vote — and generally more politically engaged — following the Supreme Court’s decision on Roe. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kyla Ross (33, Massachusetts, Black, Democrat): The overturning of Roe. That was very upsetting, especially because I’ve seen the positive effects of abortion access — particularly in Detroit, which is where I grew up. Even when I was like a teenager or in middle school, I know some people who had to get abortions. And I saw for myself that them making that decision and having access to abortions benefitted their lives greatly. I was also turned off by all of the extremist and hateful rhetoric coming from the Republican side and feel as though voting and donating are my way of mitigating those types of things.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Aditya Eachempati (61, Missouri, Asian, Republican): Certain policies or political factors may have influenced who I cast a ballot for, but not whether I actually vote. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lisa Ayala-Davis (48, Georgia, Hispanic, Democrat): I’m a regular voter. I mean, I’ve practically voted in every election I’ve been eligible for. The only year I didn’t vote was in 2000, but I was married to a soldier and living in Germany at the time, and I didn’t know about the process of requesting an absentee ballot. All of that is my long-winded way of saying that it doesn’t take a lot of motivation for me to go vote. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Which election result — or trend — surprised you the most?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: I’m amazed at how well Republicans performed in California and New York. The Lauren Boebert race in Colorado was interesting to watch, too. And, being a health care provider, I was also floored that some political prognosticators were ‘shocked’ to see that abortion access was a big issue to voters. I think polling vastly undershot that. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: Historically, I know the out-party is usually more successful in the first midterm election after a new party takes over the presidency. That said, I was definitely surprised that Republicans didn’t do better. I feel like I heard a lot of chatter about more fringe Republican candidates who ended up not doing as well as many people thought they would. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: As someone from Detroit, I knew that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was going to win. I think she’s a great governor and I understood why she handled the COVID-19 pandemic the way she did. I was surprised, though, that Democrats ended up flipping the state legislature, too. I wasn’t too shocked about much else. I knew that Democrats would keep the U.S. Senate, and I think certain political pundits underestimated the intelligence of voters in this country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: In Missouri? Nothing. But I didn’t think Whitmer would win as easily as she did. I’m also a bit surprised that Republicans picked up a few congressional seats in New York. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: How would you assess both Republican and Democratic performance this election cycle? Did one party exceed or fall short of your expectations? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: With everyone talking about a ‘red wave,’ I was pretty shocked at how badly Republicans whiffed it this year. Regarding Democrats, I’d say that the quality of their candidates exceeded my expectations. I was happy to see a lot more pragmatic Democrats running. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: Going off of my previous answer, I definitely think that Democrats performed better than I expected — while Republicans performed more poorly. Considering that the economy and inflation were consistently listed as top concerns for voters headed in the midterm elections, I’m really surprised that Democrats didn’t face more backlash over things like gas prices or high inflation rates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: I feel like Democrats could have had a stronger ground game in certain states. I also think that, sometimes, Democrats aren’t as vocal about their accomplishments and, as a result, their good deeds get muddled by all of the mess that’s constantly being spewed by the Republican Party. That’s one thing I appreciate about Republicans: Their messaging has been on point. For example, Trump isn’t even in office anymore and yet, somehow, I still know what he said on his social media platform yesterday. For better or worse, the party is very loud and vocal when it comes to telling voters their plans, and Democrats need to do a better job of taking them seriously.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: Even though Republicans fell short of my expectations, some reporting suggests that they actually did quite well in U.S. House races and won the national popular vote by 3 points. Democrats performed about as I expected they would, but I think they won more races than they should have, in part, because Republicans ran weak candidates against them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Did you only vote for your party’s candidates, or did you cross party lines for any candidates? If you did vote for any opposite-party candidates, can you elaborate on why?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: I voted a straight blue ticket this November. At the local level, there was a Republican state representative running whom I voted against because she didn’t believe in any exceptions for abortion. And I voted against Vance because of his stances on Ukraine. That said, if Vance’s beliefs were closer to that of outgoing Sen. Rob Portman, I would’ve <em>probably</em> voted for a Republican in that race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, in all honesty, I don’t think I can see myself voting for Republicans until they publicly condemn the Jan. 6 insurrection. In a way, I’m sort of voting for Democrats as a punishment to Republicans until they get back to their old values and cut out the more cancerous sects of the party. I did vote in the GOP primary this year, but I only supported moderate candidates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: I identify as an independent. I grew up in New Hampshire and feel like a lot of people there identify as independent, too, but my views definitely lean Democratic. That said, I did technically cross party lines and vote a straight blue ticket this year, but I still feel like the independent label encompasses my beliefs better. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: I did not. I voted for Democrats up and down the ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: I crossed party lines in Missouri’s U.S. Senate race and voted for [Democrat] Trudy Busch Valentine over [Republican] Eric Schmitt mainly because I don’t like Schmitt. I didn’t like that he was primarily funded by the finance industry and he didn’t seem to have a clear plan for what he wanted to do if elected. It just seemed like he wanted to file a bunch of lawsuits. To be clear, I didn’t think Valentine was a particularly strong candidate, either, but at least she wasn’t Schmitt. I also voted for the Democrats running for attorney general and secretary of state but supported Republicans in every other race here. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: The one Republican that I voted for is a personal friend who ran unopposed for county commissioner. But besides that, I did not cross party lines. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are you more or less optimistic about the country’s future following the 2022 midterm elections?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: I’m tentatively optimistic, but generally pessimistic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: I’m very, very cautiously optimistic because a lot of the more radical, or fringe, Republican candidates were not successful in their general election races. That makes me hopeful that the cycle of political polarization we’ve seen in the last few years will stop. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: I am more optimistic. Before the election, it was easy to get discouraged because it felt like every single person on TV was saying that there was going to be a ‘red wave’ or that Democrats were going to be embarrassed by the results. But then the election came about and over and over again it was proven that issues like abortion access and preserving democracy were important to voters this cycle. That makes me feel so vindicated and optimistic about our future. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What are you hoping the federal government can accomplish with a Republican House and Democratic Senate? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: If they accomplish anything, I’ll be shocked. I have no expectations for them to get anything done. Still, I’d like to see Congress tackle another big infrastructure bill. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: My reality pants are on, and they’re making me say that nothing meaningful will get done. Democrats might get more federal judges (blah, blah, blah), but as far as passing bills and stuff like that, I’m skeptical. That said, if House Democrats play their cards right and grab five or six Republicans they can negotiate with, then <em>maybe</em> Democrats — and Congress generally — will be able to pass stuff. If so, I hope they’re able to pass more progressive legislation on issues like health care, child care and education. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: I hope that Republicans can come up with solutions to decentralize things like education, energy and health care. But in general, I want Republicans to do what I like Republicans to do: Keep government small, and keep taxes lower. It’s unpopular to want to cut Social Security and Medicare, but I hope Congress will do that, too. Most of my concerns revolve around fiscal stuff because I think issues like abortion access can be dealt with through ballot initiatives at the state level. That was pretty effective in Kansas and Michigan. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: I’m hopeful that lawmakers will be able to work in a bipartisan fashion despite there being so few issues where there’s crossover support. Maybe something with immigration is possible? That’s another issue that I care about a lot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Of the two major political parties, which do you think is in a better position to govern headed into next year? Why?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: I would say that Democrats are in a better position to govern mainly because it seems like there’s a lot of political infighting among Republicans. I understand that there’s still a lot of debate regarding who’s going to be the next speaker of the House, and I think issues and divisions like that are definitely more prevalent in the Republican Party than the Democratic Party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: Neither. I think both parties are scattered across the cosmos. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: I think there will be a gridlock because the Republican House will make it its business to block anything that comes out of Democratic Senate and vice versa. The status quo will continue because everything will be blocked. I wouldn’t say either party is in a better position to govern; it’s going to be a tie, and things will probably stay the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: Obviously the Democrats. The fact that they hold the White House and Senate, I think, gives them a leg up. Republicans have a slightly bigger hurdle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: How are you feeling about the 2024 presidential contest? Why? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: It feels like there’s no clear path for either party to take at this point, and I can’t believe we’re already talking about this. I feel like I’m caught between a rock and a hard place because I can’t fathom Biden running again because of his age — but I also don’t know who else would run on the Democratic side. And then, among Republicans, I feel like Trump will be an automatic front-runner because I just don’t see the party rallying around someone else to challenge him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: We have too many elections. The 2022 midterms literally just ended, and we already have someone announcing that they’re running for president. For my own sick entertainment, I’d really like to see a race between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. But I don’t think I care to see Biden and Trump going at it again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: I think DeSantis is easily the strongest Republican presidential candidate — even if he’s not my favorite candidate per se. I don’t think Trump has much of a chance, but I think DeSantis would beat Biden. With all the senators up for reelection in 2024, Republicans have an advantage there, too; and if they stop nominating bad candidates, they should also keep the U.S. House. I’m pretty optimistic about the 2024 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: Like most of the country, I really don’t want to see a rematch of Biden versus Trump. That’s going to be so toxic. On the flip side, if DeSantis manages to get the nomination, I don’t think Biden is going to be able to beat him. The visual of an 80-something-year-old up against a 40-something-year-old will be hard to overcome. I think Biden has been a great president and has accomplished so much, so I don’t want to be ageist — but I am a realist. I guess, like every other Democrat, I’m just waiting for the next Barack Obama. I just don’t know who that person is. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Who would be on your dream presidential ticket in 2024?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: Whitmer for president and Pennsylvania Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro for vice president. But Shapiro is a tentative pick because he just got elected to the governorship. If his track record tanks between now and Election Day, I’d pick someone else to replace him. But I like Whitmer because I think she’s great. She governed under a Republican legislature and managed to help flip both chambers blue. Whitmer and outgoing Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney [for vice president] could be an option, too. I just don’t want to see Trump in 2024 — or for him to be a factor in Republican politics anymore. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: I want Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to run. He’s a fellow independent, and, as a young person, I agree with a lot of his policies. That said, it’s hard to imagine him running in 2024, given his age. And I’m not sure who I would choose for the vice president slot, but ideally it’d be someone who’s more representative of the demographic blocs Bernie can’t necessarily reach. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or California Rep. Katie Porter for president and Newsom for vice president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: DeSantis is fine, but I’d also be OK with [outgoing] Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan or Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine — basically any strong Republican governor. In general, I have a bias toward governors versus senators because I think governors have strong executive skills that senators often lack. And honestly, I don’t think the vice-presidential pick matters too much.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: I think about this stuff a lot because everybody says, ‘Well, if not Biden, who?’ And I know I’m going to sound like a closet television pundit, but the person who I think would be a really good candidate is U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel because he’s got such a good resume and he’s such a fighter. I know nobody’s thinking about him as a viable candidate, but I think whoever goes up against either Trump or DeSantis needs to be a fighter. But what do I know? </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>I don’t want to alarm anyone, but the first nominating contest of the 2024 Republican presidential primary is likely just about a year away, and one candidate — you may have heard of him — has already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-2024-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his campaign</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it’s no longer <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-way-too-early-2024-republican-presidential-primary-draft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way too early</a> for us to hold a fantasy-baseball-style draft of who we think the GOP will nominate! Everyone got their draft boards ready to go?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>Yeah, I just hope I’m not picking third or fourth. Kind of a clear top-two here, don’t you think?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter):<strong> </strong>Nobody better steal my picks! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f52a.png" alt="🔪"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/santul-nerkar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santul Nerkar</a>, editor):<strong> </strong>It’s a two-player draft! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f47b.png" alt="👻"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Hahaha</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>But I am very curious to see how things shake out after picks No. 1 and 2.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Best of luck to whoever gets pick No. 3!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, here are the rules. We are drafting the candidates we think are most likely to win the GOP <em>nomination</em> — regardless of their chances in the general election. As usual, we will do a <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍"> draft, where the person with the final selection in one round picks first in the next round. Now let me completely randomly choose the order for the first round …</p>



<ol><li>Santul</li><li>Alex</li><li>Nathaniel</li><li>Geoffrey</li></ol>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, Santul, looks like you have the first pick! And, for the first time in forever, you actually have an interesting choice here!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>[Cues up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtpIv2hBKw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA draft music</a> in my head]</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f941.png" alt="🥁"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f941.png" alt="🥁"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f941.png" alt="🥁"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To make things potentially <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> in the early going here, I’m going to go with someone <em>other</em> than former President Donald Trump, the face of the GOP for the last six-plus years. My pick is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar:</strong> My reasoning is fairly simple: Unlike in 2016, the last time the GOP primary had more than one viable candidate, it does appear that the GOP rank and file has coalesced around DeSantis as a non-Trump alternative. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ron-desantis-holds-early-lead-over-donald-trump-among-gop-primary-voters-wsj-poll-shows-11670989311?mod=hp_lead_pos6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poll</a> after <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/news-features/news/2022/12/13/00/53/suffolk-poll-shows-ron-desantis-significantly-outpolling-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> in the <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early going</a> has found that, while Republicans aren’t exactly abandoning the former president and Trumpism, they do seem enthused by the idea of a candidate who stands for many of the things Trump does — without being Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I think this is a super smart pick, Santul! But I wonder if DeSantis flops, in part because he’s not really known for his <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/01/16/trump-privately-slams-desantis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal appeal</a> in the same way that Trump is?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hmm … I guess now that I think about it, I’m not sure if that’ll help or hurt him. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f937-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♀️"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Let’s see what happens when DeSantis and Trump get on the debate stage together, but DeSantis is clearly the main alternative to Trump at this very early point. He’s attracted an unusually high level support in early polls for a governor who has never run nationally before. You don’t <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-more-than-40-years-of-early-primary-polls-tell-us-about-2020-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often see someone</a> like that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-more-than-40-years-of-early-primary-polls-tell-us-about-2020-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hitting 30 percent</a> in national polls this early.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Yeah, that’s kind of where I’m at. He already enjoys <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/favorable_ron_desantis?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high favorability ratings</a> among GOP voters, despite never having run a national campaign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>So this is obviously a very voguish pick right now, with DeSantis leading <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several early primary polls</a>, but I personally think Trump is still the more likely nominee. Take a closer look at the polls that show DeSantis ahead: They’re almost <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/13/trump-support-gop-2024-presidential-race-poll/10882346002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ron-desantis-holds-early-lead-over-donald-trump-among-gop-primary-voters-wsj-poll-shows-11670989311?mod=hp_lead_pos5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head-to-head</a> <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-de-santis-surges-to-5-point-lead-over-weakened-trump-in-2024-primary-matchup-100022596.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> between <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MLSPSC11PressRelease_NationalIssues.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">him</a> and <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a>. But I’m skeptical that the GOP primaries will actually be head-to-head races. Plenty of other candidates have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/06/hogan-president-new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/asa-hutchinson-arkansas-presidential-bid-2024-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interest</a> in <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3679041-chris-christie-on-whether-hes-considering-a-2024-presidential-bid-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running</a>, and it’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy: If Trump looks weak enough to beat, that will encourage more candidates to jump into the race, which in turn increases the odds that Trump wins. Because when you look at <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/a-new-session-of-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between</a> <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-de-santis-surges-to-5-point-lead-over-weakened-trump-in-2024-primary-matchup-100022596.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.big-village.com/big-village/2022/12/Big-Village-Politics-Poll-12.02.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeSantis</a>, and a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/2zebcvjoec/econtoplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handful</a> of <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000184-a2ea-d1d1-ad8d-affbe2e40000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other</a> <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/national-poll-bidens-approval-remains-underwater-as-majority-of-gop-voters-support-trump-as-republican-nominee-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans</a>, Trump is usually ahead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Geoffrey alluded to, I also don’t think DeSantis is fully vetted yet. I think he’s become a bit of an avatar for folks who want to move beyond Trump, but what if he’s not a good debater, or has skeletons in the closet?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, although I’m like 90 percent sure that DeSantis will run, he’s not actually in the race yet. Trump is. That counts for something.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>If only you had the No. 2 pick, Nathaniel! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Nathaniel, I do think that’s right, in the sense that people don’t think about the actual rules of the GOP primary. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/primaries/explaining-the-presidential-primary-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most primaries and caucuses</a> on the Republican side are “winner-take-all” — or at least “winner-take-most” — meaning that all a candidate has to do is finish first in a state in order to win all or most of its delegates. Trump won in 2016 in part because <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/26/trump-election-2024-presidency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he won pluralities</a> in those races against a crowded field and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/timeline.php?year=2016&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">captured most of the delegates</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Exactly. We could see a repeat of 2016 where a divided field allows Trump to rack up delegates with like 40 percent of the vote in each state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We know a solid chunk of the Republican electorate is loyal to him. And they don’t have to constitute a majority of the party for him to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, I’m not sure DeSantis’s lead in head-to-head polls will last. I feel like we’re in a particular moment where Republicans are unhappy with Trump because candidates aligned with him <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/15/data-trump-weighed-down-republican-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did so poorly in the midterms</a>. But there have been past moments where it seemed like the GOP could be poised to abandon Trump — e.g., a lot of Republican politicians criticized him after the Jan. 6 riot — but then they closed ranks around him again. What do you guys think?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I personally don’t think this will last. Trump isn’t really in the public eye right now, and we’re still a ways away from 2024. I think there’s plenty of time for current members of the party who aren’t over the moon about his presidential announcement to warm to him. Plus, as Nathaniel said before, DeSantis could struggle and Trump could become the GOP’s only viable option. Or, DeSantis could sit this one out because Trump already threw his hat in the ring.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Eh, I think DeSantis running is all but certain. He’s just likely <a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/politics/ron-desantis-presidential-run/67-30b16938-a528-4e04-a1b4-06bb1c52c428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going to wait</a> until the end of Florida’s legislative session in the spring before officially launching his campaign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I personally disagree, but that’s what chats are for!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Man, I’m already feeling buyer’s remorse for my pick!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Alex, it sounds like you have a name in mind for pick No. 2, then??</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I do, Nathaniel! I’d be a fool if I didn’t pick Trump No. 2! In short, the GOP currently is still largely the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/us/politics/trump-2024-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party of Trump</a>. Yes, there were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/14/republicans-trump-2024-00066874" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few grumbles</a> from fellow Republicans about his 2024 run, but most prominent leaders in the party have been <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/04/republicans-mostly-silent-trump-call-suspend-constitution/10832850002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely silent</a> over some of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-rebuked-for-call-to-terminate-constitution-over-2020-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his most</a> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/11/donald-trump-nick-fuentes-kanye-west-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent controversies</a>. This all suggests to me that Republican lawmakers continue to feel uneasy challenging the former president because they know they still need his base to win elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, even though our average of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s favorability rating</a> among all Americans is at an all-time low, another poll from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a>, which was released in November, found that when offered a choice between Trump, DeSantis or “someone else,” Republican voters were evenly split over who they prefer win the GOP presidential nomination (44 percent preferred DeSantis; 44 percent backed Trump; 11 percent didn’t offer an opinion). And, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-can-the-2022-midterms-tell-us-about-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve discussed before</a>, there are plenty of examples of Republicans appearing to break with Trump — only to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/06/nikki-haley-biggest-gop-flip-flops-trump-post-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall back in line later</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I think you got good value with Trump at No. 2, Alex (obviously, considering my DeSantis skepticism).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Trump could still definitely win the nomination. It’s been easy to say “DeSantis this, DeSantis that,” but he’s untested. A lot of Republicans still falsely believe Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/poll-61-republicans-still-believe-biden-didnt-win-fair-square-2020-rcna49630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost illegitimately in 2020</a>, and his favorability among Republicans <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remains high</a>, although it has gone down a little since the 2022 elections. But there’s no question the opportunity is there for Trump to win a comeback campaign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>One thing that Trump has this cycle that he didn’t have in 2016 is a lot of elite support. Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville has <a href="https://www.al.com/politics/2022/11/the-leader-america-needs-tommy-tuberville-endorses-donald-trumps-2024-presidential-campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a>, along with <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/republican-reaction-to-trump-a-few-endorsements-and-a-lot-of-crickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several House members</a>. There’s been a lot of talk about how many Republican members of Congress <em>haven’t</em> endorsed him yet (probably because they are worried he’s electoral poison), but not as much about all the support that he does have. And <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-tracking-2020-presidential-endorsements-heres-why-they-probably-still-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elite support can matter</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>To play devil’s advocate to my own DeSantis pick, it’s also still very early. Around this time eight years ago — during the cycle Trump would eventually run in and win — none other than Jeb! Bush was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/28/politics/bush-leads-gop-field-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading in GOP polls</a>. So while the field appears to be more clearly defined this time around, at this point in the cycle, the fact that DeSantis leads Trump in some early polls isn’t a guarantee of anything.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>As I alluded to earlier, I do think Trump’s candidacy will clear the field of all other serious candidates (other than, perhaps, an anti-Trump candidate or two). But it seems pretty clear to me that Republicans are scared to go up against Trump lest his loyal followers turn on them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just ask the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/16/us/politics/liz-cheney-impeachment-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 House Republicans</a> who voted in favor of his impeachment! Only <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/members-gops-impeachment-10-survived-backlash-rcna58324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two will be returning to Congress</a> next year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>It is true, however, that DeSantis gives Republicans who don’t want Trump a better opportunity to coordinate and rally to one candidate. Anti-Trump Republicans <a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2016/5/19/11712612/republican-elites-coordination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced a coordination problem</a> in 2016, as there were a bunch of GOP alternatives, no one was sure how seriously to take Trump at first, and they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/opinion/campaign-stops/why-cant-the-gop-stop-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couldn’t coalesce around one candidate</a> when it became abundantly clear Trump was the front-runner for the nomination. Once the voting got going, the alternatives eventually became Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, which also worked out well for Trump because there were parts of each candidate’s constituency <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/2016-republican-poll-trump-cruz-kasich-221111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who might’ve backed Trump</a> before the other non-Trump candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Republicans have also either lost ground or underperformed in three consecutive election cycles, and Trump’s favorability seems to be slipping relative to DeSantis’s. So I think voters could view DeSantis as a fresher, more “electable” face than they view Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, there was a <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/news-features/news/2022/12/13/00/53/suffolk-poll-shows-ron-desantis-significantly-outpolling-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University/USA Today poll</a> the other day that asked about two hypothetical general elections: In one, President Biden beat Trump 47 percent to 40 percent among all voters, but in the other, DeSantis beat Biden 47 percent to 43 percent. Of course, it’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way too early</a> to put much stock in general-election polls, but polls like that may nevertheless create a narrative.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, DeSantis would be wise to push the electability argument along with his Trump-ish approach on issues. “Look, I just won the swing state of Florida by almost 20 points, I’m polling better than Trump against Biden and I’m pushing the issues you care about, GOP primary voters.” That’s a pretty lethal combination — potentially anyway.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I’m just not convinced that Republicans care as much about electability, though. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-care-more-about-winning-than-usual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poll after poll</a> in the 2020 presidential primaries showed that <em>Democrats</em> really prioritized it when picking their nominee, but if recent GOP primaries are any indication, Republicans care more about ideological purity.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Sure, Nathaniel, but I don’t think it’s a coincidence that DeSantis seems to be <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing better in polls</a> that have narrower sample populations — his margins versus Trump are superior in surveys of registered voters compared with ones of adults, or among likely voters compared with registered voters. This suggests that more engaged voters, who <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/political-engagement-among-typology-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to also be more ideological</a>, are more likely to prefer him. That could be due to both electability (“Trump might lose, let’s find someone else”) and ideology.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I must ask … What is the difference between a DeSantis voter and a Trump voter? I don’t think they’d push vastly different policies if elected, so what’s really differentiating the two besides maybe personality? I also don’t get the vibe that anti-Trump Republicans would suddenly be gung-ho about returning to the party with DeSantis at the helm.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>It’s interesting you mention that, Alex. I’ll emphasize again that we should take  these early polls with a gigantic helping of salt, but the Suffolk University/USA Today poll Nathaniel mentioned found that DeSantis actually leads Trump among voters who identified as “conservative” or “very conservative.” It’s pretty remarkable that DeSantis has emerged as the most viable potential Trump challenger, not by positioning himself as a never-Trumper, but rather by leaning into a lot of the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-com-lantigua-asian-americans-coronavirus-hate-attacks-20200407-rk7nak2jlbautmnzfd2c2uvbnq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rhetoric</a> and <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2021/12/10/governor-ron-desantis-announces-proposals-to-stop-the-flow-of-illegal-aliens-and-protect-floridians-from-the-ongoing-biden-border-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy positions</a> that made Trump who he is.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Alex, that they would attract many of the same voters seems like a feature, not a bug, for DeSantis. As Santul said, he’s a fresh face who can bring much of the same approach but in a more electorally appealing form. I’m not sure it’s so much about electability on its own, but DeSantis can offer a combination of electoral success with <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2021/09/02/florida-desantis-5000-fines-requiring-proof-vaccination-vaccine-passport/5694871001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy successes</a> as Florida’s governor <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-dont-say-gay-law-signed-56aee61f075a12663f25990c7b31624d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that conservatives find appealing</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I guess, since they’re very similar, it’s <em>possible</em> that Republican elites end up unhappy with both candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if Trump is truly a weakened candidate — so much so that DeSantis decides to challenge him — then I don’t think the Florida governor will be the only Republican taking on the former president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Speaking of other potential candidates … With the third pick of the draft, I’m going to choose Ted Cruz. This is a bit of a bank shot: In those polls of Trump, DeSantis, and several other Republicans, Cruz isn’t polling in third; he usually <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/2zebcvjoec/econtoplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clocks</a> only <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2-3 percent</a> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.big-village.com/big-village/2022/12/Big-Village-Politics-Poll-12.02.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationally</a>. But in a world where DeSantis doesn’t run for some reason, I think Cruz is the most natural not-Trump Trumpist candidate. He’s well known in the party thanks to his 2016 presidential campaign, in which he finished second — and, historically, Republicans like to nominate the “next candidate in line.” Think John McCain in 2008 after he finished second to George W. Bush in 2000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Whoa, hello.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Wowwww.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Nathaniel, you REALLY want a Cruz 2024 run, don’t you? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Readers, this is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-way-too-early-2024-republican-presidential-primary-draft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not the first time</a> Nathaniel has selected Cruz as his first-round pick! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I’m nothing if not consistent!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>This pick is certainly reasonable to me if the goal is to pick someone who is most likely to be the GOP nominee. Cruz wants the job and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essentially finished second</a> in 2016, which to Nathaniel’s point has historically been a pathway to future success <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-modern-history-of-the-republican-presidential-primary-1976-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Republican nomination contests</a>. Besides McCain, there are Ronald Reagan (ran in 1976, won in 1980), George H.W. Bush (ran in 1980, won in 1988) and Bob Dole (ran in 1988, won in 1996).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after initially pushing back against Trump — remember his <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/rnc-2016-donald-trump-unity-225915" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 convention speech</a>? — Cruz <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/08/ted-cruz-convention-speech-donald-trump-non-endorsement-spark-blowback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught a lot of flak</a> and then <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/22/659692611/from-lyin-ted-to-beautiful-how-trump-and-cruz-found-political-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became strongly supportive</a> of Trump. So I think Cruz is less likely to run if Trump remains in the field.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, he’s in a tricky spot. He was kind of outflanked by DeSantis in the “position yourself to run against Trump but don’t be anti-Trump” invisible primary. Now his best bet might be rooting for Trump in this primary, then running himself in 2028.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Nathaniel, I’ll ask you now what I asked you back in March 2021: How can Cruz win considering <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ted-cruz-senator-paris-climate-b1790835.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how disliked he is</a> in GOP circles? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Haha, Alex, I’ll tell you what I told you then too: Among GOP voters, Cruz isn’t disliked! According to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Morning Consult poll</a>, 61 percent of potential Republican primary voters had a favorable opinion of him, while only 20 percent had an unfavorable opinion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>But he barely won his own Senate race in 2018 against former Rep. Beto O’Rourke! In fact, his approval rating is <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/ted-cruz-job-approval-trend-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still underwater</a> in his home state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I’m surprised by this pick because — like you said, Nathaniel — Cruz probably isn’t entering a race that Trump is already in, he’s not a more moderate alternative to Trump, and there’s already a strong conservative challenger to Trump right now in DeSantis. So Cruz doesn’t check the box of a never-Trumper, nor is he the most obvious right-wing alternative to the former president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I mean, look. Like we said at the beginning, I’m not sure anyone other than Trump or DeSantis has more than, like, a 10 percent chance of winning the nomination. But I think Cruz is more likely than a certain former vice president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Speaking of which … Geoffrey, your turn.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I get not one but two picks here back to back. So with the first one, I’m going to take the straightforward pick of former Vice President Mike Pence. No, I don’t think it’s especially likely that he wins the nomination, but he’s a former vice president, and that’s been a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-offices-are-good-stepping-stones-to-the-presidency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty surefire way</a> to get yourself close to winning in past primaries. He maintains at least some support <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/us/politics/mike-pence-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the donor class</a> and has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/22/mike-pence-2024-staff-00070579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making moves</a> that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-south-carolina-mulling-presidential-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portend a presidential bid</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yes, he is the candidate I alluded to earlier who’s consistently polling in third place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Albeit usually around 7-8 percent of the vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Hm, I wonder if he’s consistently polling third due largely to name recognition?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I think that’s part of it, Alex. And as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey wrote back in 2019</a>, having high name recognition but low polling numbers is not a good place to be.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1036" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Mike Pence is the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">De’Andre Hunter</a> of this two-player draft.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But yeah, I think that’s decent value for a No. 4 pick. In the unlikely scenario that Trump drops out — perhaps because of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/donald-trump-investigations-lawsuits/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">host of legal troubles</a> he’s facing right now — I think Pence’s chances go up significantly, especially next to a comparatively untested figure like DeSantis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Hey, the Virginia grad here says <a href="https://youtu.be/TtUeDFtK-xA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respect De’Andre</a>. But comparisons aside, that’s my attitude, too, Santul. Pence is there, he’s going to be able to put together a credible campaign, and who knows how DeSantis and Trump work out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Anyway, to kick off the second round with my next pick, I’m going to go with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Strong Texan representation here!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>… Do you and Nathaniel know something about Texas that I don’t?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>It’s a great factory for Republican politicians! It has produced <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-have-produced-the-most-presidential-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two recent(ish) GOP presidents</a>, and it’s obviously the largest red state. In other words, there’s a deep bench of Republican candidates there, and the ones who rise to the top are inevitably talented politicians.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I do think <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/11/14/texas-voters-ron-desantis-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this poll</a> — in which Republican voters in the Lone Star State said they preferred DeSantis over Trump by more than 10 percentage points — is telling, though. And, perhaps most notably, the survey didn’t ask about either Cruz or Abbott. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I don’t know that Abbott will run (in fact, Cruz is <a href="https://www.kut.org/texasstandard/2022-12-13/will-greg-abbott-run-for-president" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably more likely to run</a> than Abbott). But what I do know is that the man can <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/18/greg-abbott-texas-fundraising-governor-donors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise a ton of money</a> and that he has a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-governor-moves-state-sharply-right-ahead-2022-election-2021-10-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative track record</a> that would surely appeal in a primary. If we’re talking about people who could actually win a long primary campaign, Abbott has much more potential than many of the other names on my list. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Simply put, a lot of names out there are VP material. And Abbott is not one of them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Wait, he’s <em>not</em> VP material? Why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I don’t think he’d take it. Dude is the governor of Texas. President or bust.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What I’m saying is that some other potential candidates we could name are people who would happily take the VP job and would be running for president with an eye on that in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, I’m up next, and I’m going with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. He’s a rising star within the party (he had a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/25/21400661/tim-scott-rnc-speech-republican-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prime speaking slot</a> at the 2020 Republican National Convention), and he’s managed the extremely impressive feat of staying on the good side of both the Trumpist and non-Trumpist wings of the party. That might be difficult to maintain if he, uh, runs for president against Trump, but I think he might be a better politician than DeSantis and could fill that “fresh face” role nicely if DeSantis stumbles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Smart pick! I was semi-surprised his win on Election Day wasn’t more of a conversation-starter. It seemed like all eyes were on DeSantis’s performance, but Scott racked up an even more decisive win — defeating his opponent by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-south-carolina-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 points</a>. Yes, I know South Carolina is redder than Florida and Democrats never seriously targeted it, but still!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, I seriously considered picking Scott earlier. He had a very strong midterm performance, got rave reviews for his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/24/trump-republican-national-convention-day1-401134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 convention speech</a> and may be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/12/trump-gop-senators-tim-scott-presidential-00073280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering a run</a>.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>For all the chatter about Republicans wanting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congress-will-have-the-most-black-republicans-in-over-a-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a more diverse voting base</a>, I wonder if Scott offers a broader appeal as a Black man?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, Alex, I think nominating a Black man would be appealing to a lot of Republican voters who want to defuse Democratic attacks that the party is racist.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, we’re starting to run out of time, so we’re going to have to make this the last round! Alex, who’s your second and final pick?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I appreciate you all for not stealing my No. 7 pick: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In his 2021 campaign, Youngkin ran with the image of an inoffensive suburban dad and businessman. He kept Trump out of the state and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/glenn-youngkin-wont-participate-in-trumps-tele-rally-for-virginia-gubernatorial-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t appear with him</a> at the tele-town hall event Trump hosted right before the election — <em>but</em> Youngkin was smart in that he also played into some of the same issues Trump voters care about. (He even falsely claimed that the Department of Justice was trying to “<a href="https://vpm.org/news/articles/26201/politifact-va-youngkins-claim-that-mcauliffe-asked-the-fbi-to-go-after-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silence parents</a>.”) So Youngkin did everything he could to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-glenn-youngkin-kept-trump-at-arms-length-but-on-his-side-11636057542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk that line</a> — not to look or sound like Trump, while also not offending his base and still accepting Trump’s endorsement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, at least so far, tying Youngkin to Trump hasn’t been a death knell for his candidacy and political aspirations. According to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/29/virginia-governors-race-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post-Schar School poll</a> that came out a few days before the election, a majority of voters (roughly 7 in 10) thought Youngkin’s ideas and policies were similar to Trump. He won anyway. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Youngkin might want to do what former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie <em>didn’t</em> do in 2012 and start running for president roughly a year and a half into his gubernatorial term. When the iron is hot, you gotta strike. If you wait, you might find yourself suddenly more unpopular or facing a scandal or something that weakens your chances in a presidential primary, <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/chris-christie-sinking-213284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as happened with Christie</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, Alex, he could make an electability argument too: He won the governorship of Virginia by 2 points just one year after Biden carried the state by 10.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Youngkin also made <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-election-ap-votecast-survey-75520c5c9a245bee384526abc138a61a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key inroads with groups like Latino voters</a> in that 2021 gubernatorial election, suggesting he could put together a relatively more diverse coalition than other contenders.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> At the same time, though, I feel like Youngkin could be too boring/establishment for GOP primary voters. They want a fighter, not <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20211106/who-wears-the-power-sweater-vest-better-democrats-or-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweater vests</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I, personally, want to see more politicians in sweater vests, Nathaniel.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Haha.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All right, Santul, bring us home with the last pick!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f630.png" alt="😰"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Mike Pompeo is <a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/political-news/2022-03-12/former-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-makes-another-trip-to-iowa-raising-2024-speculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking for your vote</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>And he shall not get it!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>No one has picked the only Republican (other than Trump) who is actually running for president so far: former Montana Secretary of State <a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/former-mt-secretary-of-state-announces-presidential-bid/article_7126a007-089a-5392-8390-f197d41fddb1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corey Stapleton</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Stapleton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Stapleton</a> might have better odds than Corey.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For my second and final pick, I’m going with another South Carolinian: former Gov. and Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver made the point when we did our last GOP primary draft, all the way back in 2021, that Republicans might very well be tempted to back a “safer” candidate like Haley if the party suffered a worse-than-expected 2022 midterm performance because Trumpy candidates lost winnable races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Well, that scenario has now come to pass, and Republicans might find themselves having to make such a decision. If voters are too turned off by Trump’s baggage and DeSantis has a bad debate or two in the early going, I could see the GOP rank and file potentially coalescing around a different candidate. And Haley has the <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/haley-touts-new-anti-abortion-law-holds-ceremonial-second-signing/article_4e4f8d8f-9e99-5318-bd34-977c1dfa1bf0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkihaley/status/1396975960122171396?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bona fides</a>, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/ratings/politics/popularity/Republicans/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">name recognition</a> and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorability among her own party</a> to give her a fighting chance in such an environment. (Also, how many times is she going to be named as a potential candidate before actually running?)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Haley did recently backtrack on her previous promise not to run if Trump did. She’s reportedly going to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nikki-haley-says-will-decide-2024-presidential-run-over-holidays" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take the holidays to consider</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Everything Haley has done points toward a run. After <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/23/last-month-nikki-haley-was-not-a-fan-of-donald-trump-now-shes-agreed-to-join-his-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticizing Trump in 2016</a>, she joined his administration as U.N. Ambassador <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/us/politics/nikki-haley-united-nations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to amp up her foreign affairs profile</a> on top of her governing experience. So she certainly has the resume.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Interesting choice! Haley <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nikki-haley-tops-off-flood-national-gop-support-herschel-walker-rips-arrogant-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned with</a> Trump-backed U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker in Georgia ahead of the December runoff election, so I’m wondering if that says anything about her being team Trump?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I actually think she is the opposite of Scott in that she has managed to get on the <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2021/magazine-nikki-haleys-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>bad</em> side</a> of both the Trumpist and non-Trumpist wings of the party. As you said, Alex, she has mostly aligned herself with Trump since joining his administration, but she was one of the Republicans who criticized him after Jan. 6 only to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/06/nikki-haley-biggest-gop-flip-flops-trump-post-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk it back later</a>. But I’m not sure voters — or Trump — have forgotten.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I also think sexism will hold her back. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0022-3816.00019?casa_token=_5SuMi1bdxsAAAAA%3Arer1hAN9R5G1EgsC8F2MI7vYOjRmbAEPXY1asoPxpAysgMB-i-k7s6jG6V5cmVjROTRlqFdvs5oLQw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research shows</a> that female Republican candidates are perceived as more moderate, and moderate historically hasn’t been what GOP primary voters are looking for.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>That perception has played out in really ugly ways, too, Nathaniel. Haley faced backlash from her own party in 2015 for signing a bill to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House after a white supremacist murdered nine people at a Black church in Charleston, and she’s since walked that back, saying that the perpetrator “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/nikki-haley-confederate-flag/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hijacked”</a> the Confederate flag.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Interesting that Haley was the only woman we selected in this draft. I think our draft <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-way-too-early-2024-republican-presidential-primary-draft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2021</a> was slightly more diverse (though that one also went to four rounds). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I’m sorry we didn’t have time for more rounds, readers! We didn’t give <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/asa-hutchinson-arkansas-presidential-bid-2024-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asa Hutchinson</a>, <a href="https://www.concordmonitor.com/On-the-trail-48861211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Sununu</a>, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-hogan-fundraiser-113022-20221130-r57upthc55d3bpiowmp5e5snzq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larry Hogan</a>, <a href="https://listen.sdpb.org/politics/2022-07-29/noem-not-ruling-out-a-run-for-president" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristi Noem</a> or <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/05/bolton-trump-potus-2024-00072436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Bolton</a> their moment in the sun. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, GOP primary voters might not either.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, editor Chadwick Matlin turns the tables on Galen Druke and asks <em>him </em>questions about what he’s learned from covering the 2022 election and his time as host of the podcast. They consider how much preelection polling can tell us about the state of the country and what other sources we might rely on.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Coming into the 2022 midterm elections, the Democratic Party wasn’t sure what to do with its standard-bearer. With <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his poor approval rating</a>, President Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/democratic-candidates-are-hesitant-campaign-biden-recent-win-streak-rcna45339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t a hot commodity</a> on the campaign trail, as Democrats — facing an electoral environment that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history suggested</a> would be unfavorable — <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/why-republican-insiders-think-the-gop-is-poised-for-a-blowout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feared losing both chambers</a> of Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after all the votes were tallied, Democrats retained control of the Senate by winning the chamber’s four most important races, holding onto seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada and picking up an open seat in Pennsylvania. The candidates who won these races didn’t do so by remaking the Democratic coalition in their states. In fact, county-level data suggests that their performances mostly tracked along Biden’s performance in the 2020 presidential election, which saw him <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/data.php?year=2020&amp;datatype=national&amp;def=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carry all four states by narrow margins</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"> Where these Democratic candidates <em>did</em> gain ground suggests that they largely replicated Biden’s coalition while also making some small but specific inroads. In Pennsylvania counties with lots of white voters without a college degree, in some heavily Hispanic parts of Arizona, in the Atlanta metropolitan area in Georgia — Democrats won Senate seats by exceeding the margins Biden used to win each state in 2020. And even in Nevada, where Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s margin of victory was smaller than Biden’s, her performance in more affluent areas with larger numbers of white voters with a college degree suggests that she made up enough ground to offset her slightly smaller margins in lower-turnout and more racially diverse areas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To examine how these various trends played out in each state, we took a look at the county-level results and how the Democratic winners’ margins compared to Biden’s in 2020. We also dug into how these changes related to demographic and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic data in this piece is from the five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017-2021 American Community Survey, the most recent numbers available. Throughout this article, “white” refers to the non-Hispanic white population and “Black” refers to the non-Hispanic Black population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> County-level data <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t always provide a clear picture</a> of how different groups voted, so we also spent some time looking beneath the county level — at congressional district- or precinct-level results — to explore some of the key factors that propelled Democrats to victory.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>



<div>
<section>Out of this quartet, the one Democratic pickup was the open seat in Pennsylvania, which saw a striking reversion of a recent trend in American elections: white voters without a college degree increasingly opting for Republican candidates. Indeed, while Democratic Sen.-elect John Fetterman bettered Biden’s margin across almost the entire state on his way to defeating Republican Mehmet Oz by about 5 percentage points, his largest improvements over Biden tended to be in red-leaning counties with higher shares of white residents without a college degree, as the chart below shows.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two variables had a reasonably strong &lt;a href="https://www.jmp.com/en_us/statistics-knowledge-portal/what-is-correlation.html"&gt;correlation&lt;/a&gt; of 0.572. White residents without a college degree refers to the population age 25 or older that is non-Hispanic white and does not have a bachelor’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a></section><br>

<p data-paragraph="main">This pattern proved vital to the result because white voters without a college degree make up a big chunk of the Keystone State’s electorate. Three in four Pennsylvanians are white, putting the state in the top half of the whitest states in the country, and almost two in three of them do not have a bachelor’s degree. Former President Trump <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clintons-ground-game-didnt-cost-her-the-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the state in 2016</a>, in part due to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gains among voters</a> in this group, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came just shy</a> of defeating Biden there in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Fetterman’s improvement wasn’t an accident, as his campaign <a href="https://time.com/6175747/john-fetterman-pennsylvania-senate-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent a lot of time</a> and effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/us/politics/fetterman-pennsylvania-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appealing to blue-collar white voters</a> in places where Democrats <a href="https://www.ydr.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/05/heres-why-democrat-john-fetterman-is-touring-in-red-pa-counties/65347627007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have lost ground</a> in recent years. In counties with a population that’s at least 60 percent white without a college degree — which together produced about 36 percent of the state’s 2022 vote — Fetterman’s margin was 7 points better than Biden’s, on average, compared with just 3 points better elsewhere. It’s hard to know how much Oz’s profile as a Hollywood-connected television celebrity also played into these results. Fact is, Oz may have been an especially weak candidate <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/politics/pennsylvania-senate-election-oz-rural-voters/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when it came to appealing</a> to less affluent voters in more rural areas, where Fetterman made some of his most sizable gains compared to Biden. But overall, Fetterman’s improvement in farther-flung places mattered because it reduced the GOP’s ability to run up massive margins outside the state’s two major metropolitan areas, which Republicans need in order to have a path to victory in Pennsylvania.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This focus coupled successfully with Fetterman’s profile as a <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/10/love-him-or-not-john-fetterman-has-left-his-mark-on-his-adopted-hometown-of-braddock.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former mayor of a struggling post-industrial town</a> in the Pittsburgh area, which produced especially strong results for Fetterman in the western part of the state. Not only is western Pennsylvania whiter than the eastern part of the state, but parts beyond Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) <a href="https://www.politicspa.com/acela-vs-appalachia-pa-presidential-results-since-1976/69489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were once more Democratic-leaning</a> before becoming much redder in recent years. Thanks to his campaign and background, Fetterman’s margin was 8.5 points better than Biden’s across the entire Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area, including double-digit overperformances in some of the area’s more peripheral and red-leaning counties.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bulletin-20-01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area includes&lt;/a&gt; Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>15</sup></a> Now, Fetterman didn’t flip any of these counties, but he significantly reduced the Republican margin across most parts of the state’s western half. For instance, Greene County in the state’s southwest corner still went for Oz by 30 points, but Trump won it by 43 points in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, Fetterman’s winning performance didn’t necessarily involve massive engagement from every part of the Biden coalition. Fetterman ran about even with Biden’s 2020 showing in the larger Philadelphia metropolitan area, which was partly due to reduced turnout among Black voters. Philadelphia proper saw <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/upshot/midterms-election-black-turnout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notably lower participation compared with 2018</a>, the previous midterm, whereas the total number of votes cast was up almost everywhere else in the state. Nevertheless, Fetterman also did almost 5 points better than Biden in areas of the state outside of the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh metropolitan areas, showing the wide breadth of his outperformance.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Similar to Fetterman, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona won his race by holding together most of Biden’s coalition while also making small gains elsewhere. His 5-point victory over Republican Blake Masters came in part because he won a high level of support among Latino voters, a Democratic-leaning group that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-latinos-really-moved-toward-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted somewhat toward Republicans</a> in the 2020 presidential election — a trend the GOP had <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/latino-voters-stuck-democrats-southwest-2022-rcna58260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoped to build on in 2022</a>. As the chart below shows, Kelly improved on Biden’s margins most everywhere, but there was no relationship between the share of a county’s Latino population and how much Kelly outperformed Biden.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An almost nonexistent correlation of 0.013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> Take the two counties that have majority-Hispanic populations: Kelly performed 3 points better than Biden in Santa Cruz (which is 83 percent Hispanic) and ran about even with Biden in Yuma (65 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But about <a href="https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/State_Voter_Registration_2022_General.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-fourths of the state’s voters</a> live in Maricopa County (Phoenix) and Pima County (Tucson), so the topline numbers in those counties may not tell us much about the Latino vote specifically (the counties are 32 and 38 percent Latino, respectively). So we have to look <em>within</em> those counties to get a clearer understanding of how the state’s Latino population voted. For instance, in the Maricopa-based 3rd Congressional District — Arizona’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most heavily Latino seat</a> (58 percent by voting-age population) — Kelly did about 4 points better than Biden did in 2020, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JR48I4oPAM_mTfeu8-EryAb3G5t3r6JUzKVoL40nbv4/edit#gid=1352397398" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Daily Kos Elections</a>. This suggests that, at the very least, Kelly probably didn’t lose much — if any — ground among Latino voters.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1132" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/skelley.SENATE-SWINGS-3-USE.png" alt="Scatterplot showing the difference between each Arizona county's 2020 presidential election and 2022 Senate race vote margin compared to its share of Hispanic residents, sized by 2022 statewide vote share.

Mark Kelly ran a few points ahead of President Biden." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/skelley.SENATE-SWINGS-3-USE.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/skelley.SENATE-SWINGS-3-USE.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/skelley.SENATE-SWINGS-3-USE.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>

Mark Kelly ran a few points ahead of President Biden." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/skelley.SENATE-SWINGS-3-USE-mob.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/skelley.SENATE-SWINGS-3-USE-mob.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/skelley.SENATE-SWINGS-3-USE-mob.png?w=1340 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">This takeaway is confirmed by Equis Research, a Latino-focused political firm that compared their modeled race and ethnicity voter data to precinct-level results in Maricopa. Equis found that as the share of the Latino population in a precinct grew, Kelly’s performance <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosodio/status/1594735839833198593/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved at about the same rate</a> as Biden’s had in 2020. And across majority Latino precincts in Maricopa, <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosodio/status/1594736605633433602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equis calculated</a> that Kelly did about 1 point better than Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelly also made further inroads in competitive or red-leaning areas in Phoenix with larger white populations. Within Maricopa County, Kelly did 5 to 7 points better than Biden in the 1st, 4th, 5th and 8th congressional districts (all but the 5th are entirely in Maricopa). These districts vary quite a bit in terms of partisanship, too, as the 1st and 4th are both highly competitive and the 5th and 8th districts are both solidly red. Considering registered Republicans in Maricopa <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/upshot/georgia-voter-turnout-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned out at a slightly higher rate</a> than registered Democrats, Kelly’s performance suggests he may have won over some right-leaning (or formerly right-leaning) voters to outperform Biden’s 2020 showing.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"> Staying in the Southwest, Nevada also provided another key hold for Democrats in the Senate. Unlike the Democratic winners in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, Cortez Masto didn’t outperform Biden’s 2020 numbers statewide, but she did <em>just </em>enough to come out on top against Republican Adam Laxalt by 0.8 points statewide after Biden carried the state by 2.4 points in 2020. She did this by holding onto similar levels of support in places with large Latino populations and by performing on par (or slightly better) in areas with more college-educated white voters, who have been <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving toward Democrats nationally</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as always, Nevada came down to the vote tallies in Clark County (Las Vegas) and Washoe County (Reno), and in the end, Cortez Masto managed to lose a little ground in the former while staying even with Biden in the latter. And because Clark and Washoe contributed the vast majority of the statewide vote, Cortez Masto didn’t benefit much — but also didn’t hurt her chances — by running a tad better than Biden in the rest of the state.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nevada has very few counties with sizable populations, so analyzing the state’s vote means moving below the county level to some extent. The three largest cities in Nevada — <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lasvegascitynevada/PST045221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/hendersoncitynevada/PST045221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henderson</a> and <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/northlasvegascitynevada/PST045221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Las Vegas</a> — are all based in Clark County, and using precinct-level data, we can see that Cortez Masto did a tad better than Biden in wealthier and whiter Henderson while losing a little ground in the more racially and ethnically diverse Las Vegas and North Las Vegas. While she lost Henderson, a more well-educated GOP-leaning city that’s 60 percent white, Cortez Masto actually did 1 point better than Biden. And though she easily carried Las Vegas (42 percent white) and North Las Vegas (just 24 percent), Cortez Masto’s margin of victory was 1 point lower than Biden in the former and 2 points lower in the latter.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are small differences, to be sure, but given the closeness of the race, every little shift mattered. Moreover, Cortez Masto performed almost identically to Biden in Washoe County as a whole, which looks similar to Henderson, another sign that whiter, wealthier and more educated areas in the two major metropolitan centers of the state didn’t break for the GOP but instead helped Cortez Masto stay in office. Turnout was also part of the story, however, as Clark had the sharpest drop in vote share amongst all Nevada counties compared with 2020’s vote totals, and more diverse places like Las Vegas and North Las Vegas saw steeper declines than whiter and more affluent areas like Henderson. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, this doesn’t mean Latino voters, who make up close to 30 percent of the state’s population, weren’t vital to Cortez Masto’s reelection. Equis Research examined the precinct-level vote in Clark and found that, crucially, Cortez Masto’s support in heavily Latino precincts <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosodio/status/1594735846154178560/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was almost identical to Biden’s backing</a> in the same places. As we saw <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">throughout the country in 2020</a>, Biden underperformed 2018 and 2016 Democratic numbers among Hispanics in Clark, but Cortez Masto avoided letting things slip further, which could have cost her reelection.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"> In Georgia’s Dec. 6 runoff, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeated Republican Herschel Walker by nearly 3 points after neither candidate won an outright majority in November. While the urban and suburban counties in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania were crucial to the Democratic wins in those states, Georgia may have provided the best demonstration for how a Democratic candidate’s strong performance in such places led to victory. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-path-to-a-house-majority-goes-through-the-suburbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index</a>,<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index for counties is the natural logarithm of the average number of people within a five-mile radius of every census tract in a given county, based on a weighted average of the population of each census tract. Population data is from the 2020 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> we can see that the more densely populated a county, the better Warnock tended to do compared to Biden’s 2020 margin. Most notably, Warnock increased Democratic vote share across the Atlanta metro area, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/02/us/elections/georgia-senate-results-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running up margins</a> in the city’s increasingly diverse suburbs — a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national trend</a> we’ve seen in major population centers and one that helped Biden win the presidency two years ago.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Warnock’s improvement speaks to the proliferation of parts of the Democratic coalition in the Atlanta area, including a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing base of Black voters</a> and a shift among white college-educated voters toward the party, but also <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/white-populations-decline-in-diversifying-atlanta-suburbs/FLQ55YEVD5CMLBEO23OPRT3CE4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meaningfully large</a> Latino and Asian communities in parts of the region, too. The results also demonstrate how increased diversity in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/28/warnock-walker-georgia-suburbs-cobb-county-democrats-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formerly lily-white suburban counties</a> like Cobb and Fayette has changed the politics of such places dramatically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Warnock’s most impressive showing was in the 11 counties of the <a href="https://atlantaregional.org/about-arc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlanta Regional Commission</a>, which constituted almost half of Georgia’s vote in the 2022 runoff. Warnock won this region by almost 34 points, a 6-point improvement on Biden’s performance. Most of the region’s vote came from four principal counties: DeKalb and Fulton, which contain the city of Atlanta, and Cobb and Gwinnett, which are big suburban counties that sit north of Atlanta. Warnock outperformed Biden’s marks in each county by 5 to 7 points, despite a fair bit of variation in the racial and ethnic makeup of these places: DeKalb and Fulton have majority and plurality Black populations, respectively; Gwinnett’s population is roughly one-third white, one-quarter Black and one-fifth Latino; and Cobb’s population is half white and a quarter Black. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But his improvement over Biden showed up elsewhere in the Atlanta metro area, too. This included strong performances in two fairly different counties just south of the city: Warnock outperformed Biden by 7 points in Clayton County, which is 69 percent Black, but he also outdid Biden by 6 points in Fayette, a majority white and increasingly competitive county next door.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Outside of Atlanta and its environs, Warnock’s improvement over Biden was spottier, but he still tended to do better in counties surrounding other smaller cities in the state, such as Augusta, Columbus, Macon and Savannah, which are also comparatively more urban or suburban than much of the state. For his part, Walker did better than Trump in many places, but as the chart conveys, most of them were rural and less populous, which together couldn’t remotely make up for Walker’s losses in the more populous parts of the state.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The political environment will shift and change before we get to the 2024 election, but these performances show how Democrats can win if they maintain backing from the party base, gain support in increasingly diverse suburbs and campaign even in more rural and whiter places that have moved toward the GOP. It’s of course not all up to Democrats, as Republicans will need to pick <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/upshot/2022-republicans-midterms-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stronger statewide candidates</a> who can challenge Democrats’ ability to make inroads among more GOP-leaning constituencies. But at least in 2022, these four Democrats largely retained most of Biden’s coalition and at times added to it, which ensured Democrats continued control of the Senate in the next Congress.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/07/one-in-four-u-s-parents-say-theyve-struggled-to-afford-food-or-housing-in-the-past-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A quarter of parents</a> across the country have struggled to afford housing in the past 12 months, reflecting a broader problem with housing access amid persistent inflation. These conditions are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/07/03/inflation-homeless-rent-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only adding to America’s ongoing homelessness crisis</a>. While homelessness decreased nationally between <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/whats-behind-rising-homelessness-in-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2007 and 2016</a>, trends <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/briefing/homelessness-america-housing-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have since</a> reversed. More than <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half a million Americans</a> were homeless in January 2020, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new era of uncertainty and joblessness that still lingers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Generally, Americans support tackling housing insecurity, with <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MC_BPC-Housing_ANALYSIS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71 percent saying</a> that it should be at least an important priority for Congress to pass legislation growing the housing supply and improving housing affordability. But research also suggests that while Americans want more kinds of infrastructure to reduce homelessness, far fewer want those resources close to where they themselves live.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this year, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/12/01/opinions-national-vs-local-development-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> surveyed Americans about building almost 40 kinds of developments, ranging from country clubs to waste management facilities. Regarding social infrastructure, 85 percent of Americans supported building homeless shelters somewhere in the United States. However, when they were asked about building shelters in their own local area, support was over 20 percentage points lower. Support for low-income housing followed a similar pattern, with broad approval for building it someplace in the country (82 percent) but much less for building it locally (65 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This discrepancy isn’t necessarily new or surprising, however. More recently, we’ve seen it play out in American cities throughout the pandemic. For example, in New York City’s Upper West Side, the city <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/11/upper-west-side-homeless-hotels-lucerne-nyc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily housed</a> homeless people in unoccupied hotel rooms. But after local homeowners and renters protested, the city relocated many of the people to other neighborhoods. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“At some level, people want to look good. And so when asked if they support low-income housing, people say yes. But when that housing gets closer and closer, then people start to think about tangible impacts,” said <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/uep/people/faculty/shomon-shamsuddin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shomon Shamsuddin</a>, a professor of social policy at Tufts University. “It no longer becomes something they choose to support in theory. They perceive it as something forced on them by somebody else.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s more than just optics. Ultimately, pushback against affordable housing tends to draw on the assumption that such housing raises crime rates, because people tend to believe the poor are more likely to commit crimes, Shamsuddin said. However, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/24/1074577305/homeless-crime-experts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research suggests</a> that an increase in temporary shelters, like tents, for unhoused people in a given area does not track with an increase in nearby property crime. And that misconception points at an underlying question: Do Americans view homelessness as a crime issue or as a poverty issue? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The aforementioned YouGov poll implies that Americans believe that the people who need affordable housing options are less desirable to have in one’s community. And this idea goes beyond individual citizens. For example, many local governments have focused on <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/tent-encampment-San-Francisco-raid-removal-SFPD-12867393.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using police force and the law</a> to deal with homelessness, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/25/us/los-angeles-police-echo-park-homeless/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">destroying encampments</a> of unhoused people. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Even the term ‘affordable housing’ comes out of an effort to make people more comfortable,” said Shamsuddin. “‘Low-income housing’ has certain [negative] connotations.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And so stigma continues to lurk over affordable housing, even as access to it has become a pressing concern for so many people.</p>



<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>Former President Donald Trump is the least popular he’s been since July 2015, according to a recent <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3863">Quinnipiac University poll</a>. Only 31 percent of registered voters had a positive opinion of him, while nearly twice as many (59 percent) had a negative opinion. Though much of that split is partisan, his numbers among Republicans are also on the decline: Only 70 percent of registered Republican voters see him in a positive light, his lowest in-party popularity since March 2016. And as Trump looks toward a 2024 presidential bid, 70 percent of registered voters said they would not like to see him become the Republican nominee. </li><li>This is the third holiday season since the <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">World Health Organization declared</a> COVID-19 a pandemic, and most Americans no longer consider the virus a factor in planning their festivities. A <a href="https://civicscience.com/more-than-two-thirds-of-americans-say-holiday-plans-will-be-not-at-all-impacted-by-the-pandemic/">CivicScience survey</a> conducted Nov. 13-Dec 12 found that just 8 percent of Americans expected COVID-19 to affect their holiday plans “a lot” — down from 13 percent in 2021 and from 45 percent in 2020. Roughly the same share said they’d “definitely” be spending Christmas with their friends and family this year (60 percent) as said so in 2021 (57 percent); both these figures were notably higher than the share who reported the same in 2020 (29 percent). </li><li>About half of Americans either somewhat (22 percent) or strongly approved (26 percent) the United States’s prisoner exchange with Russia that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/brittney-griner-good-spirits-receiving-care-texas-whs/story?id=94950471%5D">freed American basketball player Brittney Griner</a> last week, per a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/sports/survey-results/daily/2022/12/08/45ba7/1">YouGov survey</a>. Support for the exchange was especially high among Democrats (71 percent), compared with only 34 percent among Republicans. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/sports/survey-results/daily/2022/12/08/45ba7/2">Additional YouGov data</a> found that 49 percent of Americans believed that the Russian justice system unfairly treated Griner, who was arrested early this year on drug trafficking charges related to carrying a personal supply of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/sports/basketball/brittney-griner-athletes-cannabis-marijuana.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article">medical marijuana</a> and was subsequently <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wnba-star-brittney-griner-moved-penal-colony-mordovia/story?id=93508304">sentenced to more than nine years</a> in a penal colony. </li><li>A recently released <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/13/k-12-parents-differ-by-party-in-how-frequently-they-discuss-certain-national-issues-with-their-children/">survey from Pew Research Center</a> found that 25 percent of American parents of K-12 students said racism and racial inequality come up in conversations with their kids very or fairly often. Meanwhile, around 7 in 10 parents said the topics either arise sometimes (39 percent) or rarely, if ever (28 percent). Among Democratic parents of K-12 children, 34 percent said race-related topics come up at least fairly often, while the same frequency was reported by just 15 percent of Republican parents. </li></ul>

<p data-paragraph="main">As the broader electorate shifted left in 2020, compared to 2016, Latino voters shifted 8 percentage points to the right. It was the biggest shift of any demographic group between the two presidential elections and led to some speculation about a possible realignment. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, Galen Druke speaks with Equis Research co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosodio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Odio</a> about whether that trend continued in the 2022 midterms and what it all means for 2024.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Welcome to Invisible Divides, a series exploring the profound differences in worldview between Democrats and Republicans. These beliefs about education, religion, gender and race align with partisanship — but run much deeper. Differences like these don’t just influence the ways Democrats and Republicans vote, but also how they think about their place in America. And they help explain why opposing views on important issues today seem increasingly irreconcilable.</em></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Julian Morein was sitting in the back room of a Hillary Clinton campaign office when he realized that Donald Trump was going to win the 2016 election. He was 17 years old, and although he was just a few months away from being able to vote, he had been spending all of his free time working to get out the vote for Clinton in his home state of Pennsylvania. “I remember everyone my age just feeling like our futures had been stolen,” he said. “The older volunteers were devastated, of course, but they weren’t as angry. For us — the younger people — we felt like the older generations had failed us. And now we were the ones who were going to have to pay.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Six years later, Morein is out of college and working at a nonprofit in Philadelphia. He’s voted in every major election since he turned 18. He’s part of a generation of new voters who became adults in the shadow of the 2016 election. And according to an August <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/538-PerryUndem-YouGov-Survey_Topline-Results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/PerryUndem/YouGov survey</a> of likely voters,<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey was conducted via online panel Aug. 10-21, 2022, among 1,796 likely voters, including oversamples of Black, Latino and Asian American/Pacific Islander respondents. Likely voters included registered voters who said that they are “almost certain to” or will “probably” vote in the November midterm elections. The sample was weighted to match the general population. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> politics is especially personal for Generation Z.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Younger voters and older voters see different problems" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/elJBa/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="324" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The youngest generation of voters is more likely than older groups to vote for Democrats — but it also has a much more radical view of how the country should address long-standing problems. According to our survey and others, voters ages 18 to 29<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other age groups included ages 30 to 44, ages 45 to 59 and ages 60 or older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> are more likely than any other cohort — even those only a decade or two older — to say that abortion should always be legal,<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked whether abortion should be “legal in all cases,” “legal in most cases,” “illegal in most cases” or “illegal in all cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> that racism and racial inequality are big problems in the U.S.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked how big of a problem 11 different issues were. Other response options included “somewhat of a problem,” “small problem,” “not a problem at all” or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> and that they favored dramatic moves to undo injustices of the past, like cash payments to descendants of enslaved people.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were given two ways the U.S. government could atone for or make amends for the country’s history of slavery and discrimination. They were asked whether they favored or opposed each way. Options included “strongly” or “somewhat” favor, “strongly” or “somewhat” oppose or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> What’s more, many young Americans have told us that they feel compelled to vote because their values and goals feel so at odds with the people controlling the levers of power.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Historic events of the past few years have defined many young voters’ worldviews, too. One such watershed moment was the May 2020 video of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling for nine minutes on the neck of a 46-year-old Black man, George Floyd, killing him. A summer of protests against racial injustice throughout the country would follow, along with Chauvin’s conviction.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Voters under 30 were most likely to view racism as a systemic problem that must be addressed. In our survey with PerryUndem and YouGov, they were the only age group with a majority (57 percent) in favor of cash payments for descendants of enslaved people. When we asked whether they agreed with the statement, “White men are the most attacked group in the country right now,” only 26 percent agreed, the least of any age group. They were also the most likely to think that people of color becoming a majority of the U.S. population would strengthen the country, with 39 percent saying so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Younger voters are divided on reparations" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/W6LvE/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="282" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The group overall was also much more likely to support the Black Lives Matter movement, with 63 percent saying they did. Support for the Black Lives Matter movement broke down along especially partisan lines, as it was the biggest predictor of how respondents planned to vote (more than 4 in 5 of those who agreed with the statement “I support Black Lives Matter,” “definitely” or “probably” planned to vote for Democrats, and similarly, more than 4 in 5 of those who disagreed planned to vote for Republicans).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some ways, this generation of voters is already living in the United States of the future, which may be driving their attitudes. According to the <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/index.php/latest-research/more-8-million-youth-are-newly-eligible-voters-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University</a>, the country’s youngest voters are also its most diverse age group, in every region. They’re becoming adults in a nation that already looks more like it will in 2050 — <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2008/02/11/us-population-projections-2005-2050/#:~:text=By%202050%2C%20the%20nation's%20racial,2005%20to%2029%25%20in%202050." target="_blank" rel="noopener">when demographers project that non-Hispanic white Americans will be a minority</a> — than the past. There’s also some evidence these young voters have been learning about racial inequities in and outside of school: Over half said that they had recently read books that dealt with racism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The young voters we spoke to did not all offer unqualified support for the Black Lives Matter organization itself, but many were generally well informed about the movement’s mission and goals. Matthew Messina, a 20-year-old college student from New Jersey, agreed with most of the group’s values relating to racial equity and social justice, but disagreed with some of their advocacy on specific issues, like defunding police departments. “I think [reforming policing should mean] more of funding social programs, increasing access to counselors for people in mental health crises, like that kind of thing,” he said. <br><br>Sergio Mata, a 30-year-old artist from San Antonio, said his support of the Black Lives Matter movement had cooled since he’d heard about <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/04/black-lives-matter-6-million-dollar-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Magazine reporting that raised questions</a> about how the organization was spending its donations. But he still believed in its ideals and sees racism in his everyday life. Mata, who is Latino, said San Antonio still feels like a very segregated city. “They say the white people live on the north side, Black people live on the east side, and then the Mexicans live on the west side,” he said. “And even to this day, you could still feel that mentality here.” Despite that, he still feels that his home city is a more liberal island in a conservative state. He feels uncomfortable traveling elsewhere in Texas, like when he visits his boyfriend’s family near Waco.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Mata, legalizing marijuana would be a big step toward erasing racial disparities in the justice system. “I don't want any people I know sitting in prison over something that's fully legalized in other states,” he said. “That still really upsets me.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelly Jacobs, a 26-year-old graduate student who lives in Delaware, wants politicians to start at a more fundamental level. “I want them to publicly acknowledge that racism still exists, and it’s still a huge problem,” she said of the people she voted to elect. “Systematically, we need change.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Dobbs ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion was another turning point for some young voters — evidence to them that the country was going backwards, not just on abortion rights but on a wide range of connected issues. As abortion bans started being implemented in states around the country, Jacobs realized that it was closing opportunities for her. “There will be certain states where I can’t take a job now because I know I won’t have a right to an abortion if I need one,” Jacobs said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The conservative court’s ruling was particularly at odds with the views of young Americans, who have become much more supportive of abortion rights over the past twenty years. According to Gallup, which has conducted regular surveys of Americans' attitudes toward abortion for decades, nearly half (47 percent) of 18- to 34-year olds in 2022 said they supported abortion rights under <em>any</em> circumstances, up from 28 percent in 2001.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Young Americans have grown more liberal on abortion" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a3Nd7/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as with race, many young voters don’t see abortion as a discrete issue, affecting only the people who want to end a pregnancy. A <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/PerryUndem-Guide-to-Impact-of-Dobbs-on-Voters-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate PerryUndem survey</a> (not conducted in partnership with FiveThirtyEight) conducted after the Dobbs ruling found that young adults (ages 18-29) were more likely than older age groups to say that it made them think about how abortion relates to other issues like sexism and racism, losing access to birth control and the potential for LGBTQ people to lose the right to marry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Young adults see a link between abortion and other issues" aria-label="Range Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dbReK/11/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="376" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Joshua Martinez, a 21-year-old who identifies as an independent but voted for several Republican candidates in the midterms, told us that he thought the justices were right to let the states set their own agendas on abortion. But he was concerned that the Dobbs ruling might signal the court’s willingness to roll back other protections, like gay marriage. “That could impact people I care about,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These major news events may reshape the electorate. The PerryUndem survey found that young adults were more likely than any other age group to say that the Dobbs decision made them want to vote in the midterms and would have a long-term impact on who they vote for. But even if younger Americans simply followed the typical pattern for all voters and vote more frequently as they grow older, the experiences that could shape their political evolution are happening now — which could in turn shape the future of the country.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion-rights advocates took their fight to the states — and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-rights-are-reshaping-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they won</a>. The pro-choice side emerged victorious in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/where-americans-voted-to-protect-abortion-rights-in-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly every 2022 election</a> where abortion rights were at stake — including five <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-abortion-vote-in-kansas-looks-like-its-going-to-be-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ballot</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ballot-measures-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measures</a> to either enshrine or abolish abortion rights in state constitutions. For many liberals, it felt like they had hit upon a winning strategy to protect abortion rights in a post-Roe world: bring the issue directly to the people. Talk quickly started about putting more pro-abortion-rights amendments <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/abortion-dobbs-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the ballot in 2024</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a problem: Many states don’t let citizens put constitutional amendments on the ballot. And that includes most of the states with the strictest abortion bans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Can your state protect abortion rights in its constitution?" aria-label="Map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MWV2I/36/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="747" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the 22 states that have a total or six-week abortion ban on the books (including states where courts have temporarily put the ban on hold), 15 do not allow <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/chart-of-the-initiative-states.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citizen-initiated constitutional amendments</a>.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of these states, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, do allow citizen-initiated &lt;em&gt;statutes&lt;/em&gt; to be put on the ballot, but there is &lt;a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Legislative_alteration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nothing stopping&lt;/a&gt; their legislatures from simply repealing those statutes if they pass. In Wyoming, the legislature would have to wait two years before fully repealing the statute, though it could amend it (i.e., water it down) at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> This includes some of the biggest and most important states for abortion access, like Texas, which, according to the American Community Survey, is home to nearly seven million reproductive-age women.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women between the ages of 15 and 49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> Overall, nearly 20 million reproductive-age women live in those 15 states, which means their access to abortion can’t be changed by residents who want to put abortion rights on the ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it is possible for voters to nullify an existing ban in the other seven states, which are home to just over seven million reproductive-age women. A ballot measure enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution — like the one Michigan voters <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2022/11/proposal-3-passes-etching-abortion-rights-into-michigan-constitution.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed in 2022</a> — could legalize abortion in Arkansas, <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article269733961.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missouri</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/oklahoma-citizen-led-initiative-codify-abortion-access-94241128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/medicaid-expansion-leads-in-south-dakota-eyes-turn-to-florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Dakota</a>. It would put a decisive end to the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2022/10/07/arizona-abortion-law-state-appeals-court-puts-1864-ban-hold/8210265001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/judge-puts-on-hold-north-dakota-trigger-law-banning-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fights</a> over Arizona’s and North Dakota’s bans as well. The biggest battle could be in <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/11/10/in-the-wake-of-gop-supreme-court-sweep-ohio-activists-plan-ballot-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a>, where a six-week ban is currently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-ohio-mike-dewine-government-and-politics-43558a59477f0260f7eec6db33fd30f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked in court</a> but there has been talk of passing an <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/06/24/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-ohio-heartbeat-abortion-ban/9822059002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even stricter ban</a> that covers all stages of pregnancy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, these amendments still wouldn’t be easy to pass. According to <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;map=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling by Civiqs</a>, a majority of adults in Arkansas, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota believe abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. And in Ohio, where a majority of adults do support legal abortion in most circumstances, Republicans have proposed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ohio-united-states-voter-registration-c2c927bf564521d5b3d18dfc69e21374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising the threshold</a> to pass any citizen-initiated constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60 percent. Republicans have denied that this is an <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/11/18/legal-expert-voter-advocates-slam-ohio-gop-plan-to-make-citizen-ballot-initiatives-harder-to-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intentional attempt</a> to make it harder for a potential abortion-rights amendment to pass, but it would certainly have that effect. Abortion-rights advocates might end up having the best shot in Arizona, where a majority of residents think abortion should be legal in most cases, and a 19th-century ban on abortion is being challenged in the courts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few other states could also see abortion-related ballot measures in the future, even if they wouldn’t change the law as it stands right now. For example, abortion is currently legal before 20 weeks in Nebraska, but it’s possible the state will pass a stricter ban in the next few years.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although state Republicans &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/nebraska-governor-call-special-session-discuss-12-week/story?id=88140763" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;did not have enough support&lt;/a&gt; to pass even a 12-week ban last summer, they may try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a> However, since Nebraska allows citizen-initiated constitutional amendments, a Michigan-style ballot measure could guard against this.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And abortion is currently protected in under the Florida and Montana state constitutions, but only because their state supreme courts have said so. And they could very well <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/political/abortion-advocates-worry-unfavorable-ruling-ahead-after-florida-supreme-courts-erroneous-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change their minds</a> — there are currently <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2022/08/09/montana-abortion-laws-will-remain-on-hold-state-supreme-court-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion-related cases</a> pending before both courts. Abortion-rights advocates may try to pass amendments explicitly protecting abortion rights in these states, too, as insurance against future unfavorable rulings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, Colorado, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon could use citizen-initiated constitutional amendments to protect abortion rights as well.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois also allows citizen-initiated constitutional amendments, but they are “&lt;a href="https://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/con14.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;limited to structural and procedural subjects&lt;/a&gt;” about the legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>21</sup></a> Although abortion rights aren’t seriously threatened in these states, advocates may want to put pro-abortion-rights measures on their ballots anyway as a symbolic move (or to protect against extreme future scenarios) — similar to amendments passed by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-08/2022-california-election-proposition-1-abortion-rights-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/11/08/measure-to-enshrine-abortion-rights-in-vermont-constitution-poised-to-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont</a> in the 2022 election. In fact, Democrats may see an advantage to be gained by doing so. In Michigan this year, high interest in the abortion amendment appeared to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-house-election-margin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buoy Democrats up and down the ballot</a> (though this <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-11-21/california-role-2022-midterm-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not appear to be true</a> in California). Although most of these states are solidly blue, voters motivated by an abortion-rights measure could theoretically boost Democrats in districts like Colorado’s 3rd — where a Democrat nearly unseated Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert in November — and Oregon’s 5th. Of course, with 2024 being a presidential election year, many voters won’t need to be told twice to go to the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Dec. 14, 2022, 1:50 p.m.):</strong> This story has been updated to make clear that each state’s share of women 15-49 is relative to national numbers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Dec. 14, 2022, 2:10 p.m.):</strong> A previous version of this story said Illinois could pass a citizen-initiated constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights. However, constitutional amendments in Illinois are limited to changes in legislative structure or procedures.</p>]]></description>
