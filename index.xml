			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Did you tune into (or are you currently watching) the opening ceremonies for the Winter Olympics Friday morning? Did you even realize the opening ceremonies were happening? If not, you’re not alone. Polling shows enthusiasm for the Games is muted, and while the Winter Games <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/en/SB-Blogs/COVID19-OpEds/2022/02/02-Erickson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are typically not as popular</a> as Summer Games in the U.S., the fact that the Olympics are being held in China doesn’t help. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">American interest in the Games is lower than it has been in the past. According to an <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/us-and-global-public-attitudes-2022-beijing-winter-olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos poll</a> conducted ​​Dec. 23–Jan. 7, 42 percent of adults said they were interested in the upcoming Games, compared with 55 percent ahead of the last Winter Olympics, in 2018. Just 45 percent of American adults said they planned to watch some or a lot of the Olympics, according to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/31/beijing-olympics-viewership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 25-27. That’s roughly the same as the percentage who said they planned to watch the Summer Games in Tokyo last year, though that marked a record low for viewership intent according to the pollster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reasons for that dip are mysterious and multifaceted. Of those who told Morning Consult that they don’t plan to watch, 65 percent said it was because they aren’t interested in the events, and 57 percent said it’s because they aren’t interested in the athletes (13 percent, meanwhile, blamed the time zone difference). There are likely a number of underlying factors provoking this lack of interest: For one thing, the last Olympic Games were just six months ago, so there may be a bit of event fatigue since the Games are typically spaced out every two years. There’s also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/sports/tv-ratings-sports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a general decline</a> in TV ratings for sports in recent years. And, as mentioned above, the Winter Olympics tend to be a tougher sell for American audiences compared with the Summer Games. Meanwhile, 40 percent in the Morning Consult poll said they don’t plan to watch the Olympics this year because they are opposed to China hosting the Games, and 31 percent cited it as a “major” reason.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a politics column, so let’s focus on that stat a bit. Americans’ views toward China have become more chilly in recent years: a Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey last February</a> found 67 percent of U.S. adults felt very or somewhat “cold” toward China, up from 46 percent in 2018. Among Republicans, those feelings were stronger, with 79 percent of Republicans feeling the chill. In a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/31/more-adults-approve-than-disapprove-of-u-s-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics-few-have-heard-much-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center survey</a> conducted Jan. 10-17 this year, Americans were more likely to say that, on balance, they consider China a competitor rather than an enemy, but among Republicans that trend reversed: 52 percent of Republicans said China was an enemy, compared with 40 percent who considered the nation a competitor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The choice to host the Games in Beijing has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/20/1074500316/as-the-olympics-near-activists-criticize-chinas-alleged-human-rights-violations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contentious due to China’s human rights record</a>, including <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/19/break-their-lineage-break-their-roots/chinas-crimes-against-humanity-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abuse and violence</a> against ethnic and religious minorities in the country, such as predominantly Muslim Uyghurs. In response to the criticism, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/06/2022-winter-olympics-biden-announces-diplomatic-boycott-beijing/8837884002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Biden administration</a> chose not to send an official delegation to the Games (as did <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nations-holding-diplomatic-boycott-beijing-games/story?id=82461768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of other</a> nations), a kind of “diplomatic boycott.” In a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/2/2/the-us-diplomatic-boycott-against-the-beijing-olympics-is-popular-with-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted by Data for Progress</a> from Dec. 15-18 (shortly after the boycott was announced), 67 percent of likely voters supported the decision not to send a delegation, and a plurality of American adults either somewhat or strongly approved of the boycott, according to the January Pew survey. But that Pew survey also showed just 9 percent of adults had heard a lot about it. In fact, 45 percent hadn’t heard anything about the boycott at all. Among those who had heard a lot about it, 69 percent approved of the decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some Americans want U.S. corporations to take a stand as well. When asked whether they think “companies should withdraw their advertisements for the February 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in response to human rights violations by the Chinese government,” 54 percent of U.S. adults said probably or definitely yes, according to a <a href="https://static.grid.news/NationalTrackingPolls/2201140_topline_GRID_BEIJING_OLYMPICS_Adults_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grid/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 22-23. Just 34 percent of U.S. adults somewhat or strongly support brands or companies sponsoring the Olympics, according to a separate <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/01/olympic-sponsors-china-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 29-31, while 58 percent would support brands pulling out of the Games. However, brands might be able to win support simply by issuing a statement condemning China’s actions: 55 percent of U.S. adults said they would support such a move. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, though, Americans still stand behind athletes who chose to attend the Games: 63 percent said they support U.S. athletes participating in the Games, according to that Grid/Morning Consult poll. It captures a sentiment that has been commonly expressed in the run-up to the Games: It’s fair to criticize the International Olympic Committee for selecting China as a host, and it’s fair to criticize China for its history. But many argue there’s no need to punish the athletes, for whom the chance to compete at the highest level is often a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. One that, judging by the polling, many Americans won’t see.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>According to a Jan. 21-24 Data for Progress poll of likely voters, 58 percent said they would support the Biden administration <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/1/27/a-majority-of-voters-support-biden-striking-a-deal-with-russia-to-avoid-war-in-ukraine">striking a diplomatic deal with Russia</a> to avoid war with Ukraine. Democrats, in particular, favored diplomacy, with 71 percent in favor. A slight plurality (46 percent) of Republicans agreed. However, when Americans were asked in a Jan. 28-29 ABC News/Ipsos poll about the U.S. <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/president-biden-continues-lose-ground-american-public">sending troops to eastern Europe</a> to try to discourage Russia from invading Ukraine, respondents were split: 38 percent said they opposed sending troops, 29 percent supported it and 32 percent said they didn’t know.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans’ views of the economy are still mostly pessimistic. According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx">Jan. 3-16 poll by Gallup</a>, 67 percent said they thought the economy was getting worse versus 29 percent who said it was getting better. They did find one bright spot, though: the job market. A 43 percent plurality predicted that the unemployment rate would decrease over the next six months. In addition, 72 percent said now was a good time to get a quality job — among the highest figures the pollster has recorded since it began tracking the question in 2001.</li></ul><ul><li>The majority of parents of school-age children (67 percent) believe that pandemic-related educational disruptions have put their children <a href="https://civicscience.com/majority-of-parents-say-kids-are-behind-academically-right-now-except-for-this-group/">somewhat or very behind in school</a>, according to a Jan. 19-26 CivicScience poll. And while children from higher-income families <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12187-020-09782-0">generally perform better in school</a>, parents who made more than $125,000 a year were more likely (80 percent) to believe the pandemic put their children behind educationally than those who made less than $35,000 a year (65 percent).</li></ul><ul><li>While there’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">widespread support</a> for the Biden administration’s decision to mail free at-home COVID-19 tests to anyone who wants one, fewer than half (47 percent) were able to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/01/31/who-requested-free-home-covid-tests-government">successfully request one</a>. In a Jan. 22-25 Economist/YouGov poll, fully vaccinated adults were much more likely to have successfully requested an at-home COVID-19 test (54 percent) compared with those who say they will not get the jab (27 percent). Instead, a majority (70 percent) of unvaccinated adults said they hadn’t tried to request one.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans are largely satisfied with their own lives but dissatisfied with the direction of the country as a whole. Eighty-five percent said they were very or somewhat satisfied with how things were going in their personal lives, while just 17 percent said the same for the United States, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389375/satisfaction-own-life-five-times-higher.aspx">according to Gallup</a>. People with an annual household income of $100,000 or more and those who attend religious services weekly were most likely to report satisfaction with their personal lives (at 94 and 92 percent, respectively). While nonwhite people (27 percent) and Democrats (30 percent) were the most likely to be satisfied with the direction of the country, just 12 percent of white people and just 4 percent of Republicans said the same.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Latino voters swung by <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8 percentage points</a> toward then-President Donald Trump in the last election, the largest swing of any racial or ethnic group in the electorate. Last April, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-will-trumps-gains-with-latino-voters-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a> spoke with the team at <a href="https://www.equisresearch.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equis Research</a>, a political data firm focusing on Latino voters, about <em>what</em> exactly happened. As to the question of <em>why</em> voters swung, the answer was, in large part, that we needed more data. Now we have more data! In this installment of the podcast, Equis’s co-founders share <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/61b7e8e75c74f5558036268b/1639442667560/Post-Mortem+Part+Two+FINAL+Dec+13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what they found</a>. Ultimately, Latinos’ perceptions of COVID-19 and the economy often aligned more with the vision that Trump was offering.</p>

			<title>How A Court Ruling In Alabama Could Boost Black Political Power Throughout The South</title>

			<category>Supreme Court</category>
			<category>Voting Rights Act</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Jan. 24, Alabama became the second state (after Ohio) to have its new congressional map <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/24/alabama-congressional-map-blocked-federal-court/9205925002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down in court</a>. But while Ohio’s map was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ohios-overturned-congressional-map-shows-how-lawsuits-might-scramble-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thrown out</a> by the state Supreme Court for violating the state constitution, Alabama’s was overturned by three federal judges who determined the map short-changed Black voters of representation in Congress. That’s a significant difference because it will require the Supreme Court to weigh in, potentially reshaping federal law in the process. As a result, the ruling could reverberate far beyond Alabama. It could open the door for increased nonwhite representation in other states, too — if it holds up on appeal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a refresher, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rucho-v-common-cause-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled in 2019</a> that partisan gerrymandering was a political question that federal courts should not adjudicate. However, they can still hear cases relating to <em>racial</em> gerrymandering — i.e., whether a map discriminates against voters of a certain race. Alabama poses just such a question. <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/11/alabama-senate-rejects-plan-for-new-swing-congressional-district.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back in November 2021</a>, Alabama’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/committee_proposal_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new congressional map</a> that created six majority-white districts and just one majority-Black district. Civil-rights advocates sued, arguing that Black voters in the state were entitled to a second district under the Voting Rights Act, the landmark law that prohibits racial discrimination in voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 2 of the VRA</a>, it’s illegal to deny members of a racial minority equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice. This has been <a href="http://www.publicmapping.org/what-is-redistricting/redistricting-criteria-the-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely interpreted</a> to mean that, when possible,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court decisions and congressional guidelines have, over the years, settled on some &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1429826/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fundamental criteria&lt;/a&gt; for determining when this requirement kicks in, such as that a minority group must be large and compact enough to constitute a majority of a district and that voting in the area must be polarized by race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> states must draw congressional districts where nonwhite voters are the dominant voting bloc, so as to reasonably ensure they can elect their preferred candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> by the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plaintiffs</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a>, it is readily possible to draw two predominantly Black congressional districts in Alabama. For example, in the plaintiffs’ illustrative plan A, the 2nd District’s voting-age population (VAP) is 50.0 percent Black, and the 7th District’s VAP is 50.3 percent Black.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1726" height="892" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">While the VRA explicitly states that racial minorities are not automatically entitled to a number of seats proportional to their share of the population, Black people constitute <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Black%20or%20African%20American&amp;g=0400000US01&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 25 percent</a> of Alabama’s VAP, much larger than the share of congressional districts they predominate in (14 percent). And many Black votes would have been wasted under the overturned map, with the majority-white 1st, 2nd and 3rd districts all having at least a 24 percent Black VAP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, the judges gave the Alabama Legislature until Feb. 11 to draw a new map that “include[s] two districts in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.” But by then, it’s possible that the judges’ decision will have been overturned anyway. Alabama has <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/28/alabama-asks-supreme-court-stay-order-blocking-congressional-map/9260995002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court</a>, arguing that the map should be reinstated because a new one would disrupt preparations for the state’s upcoming primary and improperly prioritize race in redistricting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The high court has yet to signal what it will do with the appeal. But the possibilities run a wide gamut: The case could lead to a very favorable outcome for liberals, a very favorable outcome for conservatives or anything in between.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On one end of the spectrum, the Supreme Court could let the lower court’s ruling stand, which would have the immediate impact of adding a new Black-opportunity congressional seat in Alabama. (In practice, this would also add one Democrat and subtract one Republican from Alabama’s congressional delegation.) It would also have ripple effects throughout the Deep South. If this ruling stands, it could inspire courts to create additional Black-opportunity districts in Louisiana and maybe South Carolina as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Currently, only one of Louisiana’s six congressional districts is predominantly Black, despite the state having one of the country’s largest Black population shares: <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Black%20or%20African%20American&amp;g=0400000US22&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 30 percent</a> of the VAP. With the state’s redistricting process just getting underway this week, Democrats have already proposed <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps</a> that would add a majority-Black seat along the Mississippi River north of Baton Rouge. For example, under Senate Bill 4, the 2nd District would have a VAP that’s 51.5 percent Black and the 5th District would have a VAP that’s 50.5 percent Black.</p>

But Gov. John Bel Edwards is a Democrat, and he’s already <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-louisiana-legislature-john-bel-edwards-46f6679aafcc1c2c431c78c44c01f503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come out in favor</a> of a second predominantly Black district. Republicans also lack the numbers in the state House to override a potential veto (although they’d only need to convince two independents or conservative Democrats to side with them to do so). That means Louisiana redistricting will probably be decided by the local courts, which would likely follow the Supreme Court’s lead and greenlight a second Black-opportunity district — if that’s what the high court decides to do in Alabama.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, South Carolina has already enacted a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/south-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new congressional map</a> with only one predominantly Black district out of seven, despite the fact that the Palmetto State is <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Black%20or%20African%20American&amp;g=0400000US45&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost one-quarter</a> Black by VAP. However, simple geography may make it harder to convince a court to order a redraw here. While it’s <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::8b0bb8c6-1c6b-4a62-9722-097b7ee1bfd4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible to draw</a> two congressional districts for South Carolina with VAPs that are around 40 percent Black, it’s difficult to draw two <em>majority</em>-Black districts without some <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::3fc53f1f-6f41-450c-b035-86a67d0d3d92" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious contortions</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/83-1968" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court precedent</a>, plaintiffs in a VRA redistricting case must show that the minority group is “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.” (Confusingly, a district doesn’t have to be majority-minority in order to <em>comply</em> with the VRA,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if Black voters constitute a majority of the primary electorate in a heavily Democratic district, that district is likely to elect Black voters’ candidate of choice even if Black voters don’t constitute a majority of the entire electorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> but it has to be possible to draw one in order for a non-majority-minority district to <em>violate</em> it.) South Carolina may not satisfy this test in a court’s eyes — though, in the event of a favorable outcome at the Supreme Court, liberals may very well try their luck just in case.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With or without South Carolina, though, the Supreme Court letting the Alabama ruling stand would be a significant boon to Black representation in Congress — and from a region that has historically suppressed Black voters to boot. It could potentially lead to two, maybe three, new Black members of Congress from the Deep South. As a result, as many as 18 percent of U.S. representatives from states that constituted the former Confederacy could be Black — the most in U.S. history.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming all current Black representatives from the region either win reelection or are replaced with another Black representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Black representation in the South could reach a new high" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wx5hW/17/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Again, though, that’s the best-case scenario for minority representation. Given the conservative ideology of the Supreme Court, the justices could instead overturn the lower court’s ruling and restore Alabama’s 6-1 map. It’s even possible that, in so doing, they will actually weaken the VRA’s protections of minority districts. Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has already <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/effects-shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neutered Section 5 of the act</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-just-made-it-harder-to-fight-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watered down other protections under Section 2</a>; in an extreme scenario, it could reinterpret Section 2 in a way that makes it even easier for states to draw discriminatory maps.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is still a lot of uncertainty about what the court will do, and as we said earlier, the decision could fall anywhere in between the two extremes we’ve laid out in this article. We’ll just have to wait and see; a decision could come down any day now.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Virginia’s new governor, Glenn Youngkin, kicked off his term with a political magic trick. In the first of <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine executive orders</a> issued on Jan. 15, the day he took office,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youngkin issued &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/executive-actions/#directives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two executive directives&lt;/a&gt; that day too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a> he banned the teaching of “inherently divisive concepts, including critical race theory” in K-12 public schools. It was a smart way to show his base he’s already jumping on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/gop-seizes-on-hot-button-school-issues-as-2022-election-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issues they care about</a>. Education policy, particularly the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/so-much-buzz-but-what-is-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged role critical race theory</a> plays in public school curricula, was a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/25/youngkin-is-using-critical-race-theory-bogeyman-rile-up-trumpian-base/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centerpiece of Youngkin’s campaign</a>. But the impact of this executive order is less straightforward than it seems, because critical race theory <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/16/rick-scott/critical-race-theory-isnt-virginias-curriculum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t actually taught</a> in Virginia public schools. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This kind of tactic is increasingly familiar in politics today. Republican politicians, in particular, build entire campaigns around false or misleading information, then implement policies that respond to those falsehoods, cementing them further in our political landscape. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The debate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over critical race theory</a> — a complex academic framework for understanding racism that would never actually be taught to second-graders but that at least <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/07/02/why-are-states-banning-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine state legislatures</a> have tried to ban anyway — is just one such example. There’s an entire gamut of culture wars where this dynamic has taken hold. Abortion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/opinion/abortion-evangelicals-conservatives.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most powerful</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/01/22/how-abortion-became-the-single-most-important-litmus-test-in-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-lasting</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/10/18295513/abortion-2020-roe-joe-biden-democrats-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social issues in modern politics</a>, is another example where arguments are increasingly framed in ways that tend to benefit Republicans. And because of that, Democrats frequently appear to be ceding ground, even though voters typically trust them more than Republicans on these issues and <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public opinion is often on the Democrats’ side</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The rebuttal to these issues seems like it should be simple. Why not just tell voters that critical race theory isn’t being taught and move on? Or say that abortions are safe and increasingly rare but will always be necessary for some women? But so far, Democrats haven’t really figured out a way to convince voters that some GOP messages aren’t based in reality. Experts told us that’s because Republicans’ often misleading framing is effective not because Americans believe it wholeheartedly or because they know all that much about the issue. Rather, the reason why abortion rights and critical race theory sticks in people’s minds is that these issues touch on broader anxieties. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Calling critical race theory an ‘existential threat’ activates racial animus and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-backlash-is-a-type-of-racial-reckoning-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fears around white victimhood</a>, which are strongly tied to support for conservative candidates and policies,” said <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/politicalscience/faculty/arora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maneesh Arora</a>, a political scientist at Wellesley College. Once those fears have been stirred up, Arora and other experts told us that it can be very difficult for other politicians to dismiss them. In fact, politicians’ sparring over the facts — or Democrats’ oversimplifying voters’ concerns as “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/obama-to-virginia-dont-elect-a-governor-who-will-indulge-in-our-worst-instincts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake outrage</a>” — might make those underlying fears seem more justified. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So that leaves Democrats going into a midterm election year with a serious conundrum: How do they fight a messaging war when the other side is playing fast and loose with the truth?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For years, the debate over abortion has revolved around misleading or downright inaccurate claims — like when former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18221707/trump-rally-el-paso-northam-abortion-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Democrats of promoting infanticide</a> (<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/apr/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-falsely-doctors-mothers-decid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they were not</a>), or when 20 Republican senators <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-senate-colleagues-send-letter-to-fda-commissioner-urging-abortion-pill-be-classified-as-hazard-to-public-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petitioned the Food and Drug Administration</a> to classify the abortion-inducing drug mifepristone as a public health hazard (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90547138/despite-republican-attacks-abortion-pill-mifeprex-is-not-dangerous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is not</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Myriad state-level abortion policies are also based on faulty or spurious science — including <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/mandatory-counseling-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counseling that requires abortion providers</a> to tell patients, inaccurately, that abortion is linked to breast cancer or infertility; legislation that <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/fetal-pain-legislation/2014-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limits abortion after a certain point</a> because of disputed research on fetal pain; and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/targeted-regulation-abortion-providers-trap-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a web of restrictions on abortion providers</a> that similar health care providers don’t face, often justified by the incorrect assertion that abortion is dangerous.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are generally not following the ins and outs of abortion politics — if anything, they may be actively avoiding it — but that also works to Republicans’ advantage. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans’ views about abortion are fuzzy and malleable</a>, in large part because they just don’t know very much about it. A <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> poll conducted in December 2019 found that Americans tend to overestimate how many abortions happen late in pregnancy, and underestimate how many abortions happen early. And while a majority are aware that abortion performed in a medical setting is safe, they were off about just how safe it is: Only about a quarter know, for instance, that it is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22270271/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safer than giving birth</a> or getting your appendix removed, which a number of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507236/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK507236.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies support</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even without much information to go on, the idea that women and doctors, abetted by Democrats, are advocating to “execute” babies — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/us/politics/trump-abortion-fact-check.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump has claimed</a> on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/trump-rally-speech-after-birth-execution-abortion-tulsa-a9577591.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple occasions</a> — might seem too outlandish to believe. But <a href="https://twitter.com/teemoneyusa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tresa Undem</a>, a researcher who studies public opinion on abortion, said that this kind of framing is successful not because Americans wholeheartedly believe it but because they don’t wholeheartedly <em>disbelieve</em> it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“​​Abortion later in pregnancy — it’s so rare that the vast majority of people don’t have personal experience with it and it’s never ever talked about,” Undem said. “So if Trump and Republicans come along and say there are doctors ripping babies from women’s wombs at the moment before birth, people will be like, ‘What?’ and there’s nothing in their minds to push back. They won’t necessarily believe it, but they’re not going to <em>not</em> believe it. That’s where I think Republicans are really successful.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Like critical race theory, abortion also taps into much deeper anxieties — in this case, about gender roles. Polls by Undem and others have found that attitudes toward abortion <a href="https://twitter.com/teemoneyusa/status/1218299448821940224?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track closely with broader attitudes</a> about women’s place in society. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people who hold traditional views, which often emphasize women’s roles as mothers, are more likely to oppose abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as misleading ideas about abortion become embedded in policy, those misleading concepts come to feel increasingly real. “There are hundreds and hundreds of policies that have been passed around the idea that women will ultimately come to regret their decision [to have an abortion] and therefore the state has to intervene to protect them and give them the knowledge they need,” said <a href="https://kupa.ku.edu/alesha-doan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alesha Doan</a>, a political scientist at the University of Kansas. There’s no evidence that this is actually true — in fact, <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/01/416421/five-years-after-abortion-nearly-all-women-say-it-was-right-decision-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the opposite seems to be the case</a> — but the policies give it an air of certainty. “People assume that politicians are passing laws for a reason, so the laws legitimize the idea that abortion regret is widespread and give it traction,” Doan said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Undem told us that abortion has been a successful culture-war issue on the right because most people don’t need to know much, if anything, about the reality of abortion in America to have an opinion on it. The debate is about values: who gets to make the decision to have an abortion, who should be involved, how much to weigh the life of a fetus. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In that sense, then, critical race theory is similar. Voters ordinarily <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/15/new-poll-shows-gop-nullifying-democrats-edge-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust Democrats</a> over Republicans on education, but invoking critical race theory is different from sparring over class size or test scores. Fundamentally, it’s also about values — specifically, how children should be taught about racism. And it’s taking hold because of conservative white parents’ fears of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more progressive school curriculum</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling suggests that this often misleading messaging is taking hold, too, as a notable share of Americans — namely Republicans — falsely believe that critical race theory is nothing more than a sinister plot to teach white children that they’re inherently evil. According to a July <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-07/Reuters%20Ipsos%20Critical%20Race%20Theory%20Topline%20071521%20_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos</a> poll, for example, 20 percent of Americans (including 16 percent of Democrats and 31 percent of Republicans) said they believed that critical race theory “says that discriminating against white people is the only way to achieve equality.” Moreover, 22 percent said they believed that critical race theory “says that white people are inherently evil or bad.” In fact, critical race theory <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says neither of these things</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even though a November Economist/YouGov poll found that <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/11/16/critical-race-theory-who-believes-being-taught" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority of Americans</a> didn’t think or weren’t sure that critical race theory was being taught in their community’s schools, there’s still a misunderstanding on how bans on critical race theory <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000537206/teachers-laws-banning-critical-race-theory-are-leading-to-self-censorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could affect the teaching of related subjects</a> that parents <em>do</em> want their kids to learn. A <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-09/Topline_USA%20Today%20back%20to%20school%20and%20COVID_090221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today/Ipsos</a> poll from late August and early September highlighted that schism: While 63 percent of parents with school-aged children said they supported their schools’ teaching about the lingering effects of slavery and racism, just 49 percent said they supported the teaching of critical race theory. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to historian <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/keisha-n-blain/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/keisha-n-blain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keisha Blain</a>, a 2022 National Fellow at New America and professor at the University of Pittsburgh, it’s hard to separate the current opposition to critical race theory in schools from a white backlash to a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-backlash-is-a-type-of-racial-reckoning-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived loss of power and status</a>. “We have seen this kind of response before in the aftermath of the civil rights movement. White conservatives began to propagate the false argument that Black Americans were somehow receiving ‘special treatment’ and thereby threatening the rights and opportunities for white people,” she said. “In the end, backlash politics thrive on misinformation, and they always rise to the surface as a way to counter any kind of political progress for marginalized groups.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the framing of abortion and critical race theory fights offers a kind of roadmap that other Republican politicians might use to run successful campaigns over the coming years. But, as several experts noted, GOP voters are not inherently gullible, nor are they more prone than Democrats to believing misinformation. “Both sides are vulnerable,” said <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/nyhan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brendan Nyhan</a>, a Dartmouth College political scientist who studies misinformation. “One of the key factors right now is that there’s a more developed apparatus for promoting false claims on the right. There’s a right-wing media ecosystem that doesn’t have a direct parallel on the left in its scope or influence.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what can Democrats do in response? One potentially disastrous option for them is to keep engaging with these issues on Republicans’ terms. While this might be easier said than done, as partisanship and strong party loyalties <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/conservative-and-liberal-brains-might-have-some-real-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help misleading information spread and thrive</a>, Democrats can still realize when they’re in a fight they can’t win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That leaves them with two leading possibilities: They could unravel some of the misinformation out there, reframing conversations in ways that are both truthful and potentially beneficial to them electorally. With abortion, that could mean talking about it as an issue that’s fundamentally about women’s power and autonomy. And on critical race theory, as Blain told us, that might look like them providing evidence on what these bans in schools really mean for public school curricula. For example, over the next several years, executive orders like the one Youngkin issued are likely to lead to teachers getting <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/fearful-of-new-laws-many-teachers-deterred-from-covering-race-related-topics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reprimanded for doing their jobs</a>. (Youngkin, for his part, already <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/glenn-youngkin-sets-tip-line-parents-report-crt-despite-not-being-curriculum-1672741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented a tip line</a> for parents to report “inherently divisive practices,” like teaching critical race theory, in schools.) So if Democrats can condemn those offenses while also reframing public discourse on those issues, public opinion — and the terms of how these debates are framed — may later be on their side. “Democrats need to push back against proposed bills that use the label of ‘critical race theory’ as a cover to simply remove the writings of Black and brown authors from the classroom,” Blain said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Alternatively, Democrats could coalesce around a completely different message that energizes their <em>own</em> base “rather than getting stuck talking about critical race theory — which is something that animates the right, and just isn’t really an issue on the left,” Arora said. Because of increasing partisan polarization, he said, it’s unlikely Republican voters’ opinion on this issue will change unless elites in their own circles say otherwise, so it may be prudent for Democrats to focus on where they can unify their own base instead. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of the choice Democrats make, though, experts said that telling voters their fears and concerns about these issues <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/obama-to-virginia-dont-elect-a-governor-who-will-indulge-in-our-worst-instincts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t real</a> is the worst of both worlds. After all, insisting that the focus on critical race theory is just fake news will only alienate the people who believe it’s not — and it won’t do much to convince Democratic voters that they should care about the underlying issues either. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On July 29, 1994, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1032/vote_103_2_00242.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the U.S. Senate voted</a> 87 to 9 to confirm Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court. Nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton, Breyer <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1994/s242" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received 100 percent support</a> from the Democratic senators present, but he also secured 79 percent of the votes cast by Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That kind of overwhelming and bipartisan support for a president’s Supreme Court nominee wasn’t unusual at the time, but it ended up marking the end of an era. Breyer received more than 90 percent of the votes cast on his confirmation, in line with about three-fourths of Supreme Court nominees in U.S. history up to that point.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including voice votes, where no vote tally is recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> But as the chart below shows, only one of the seven justices confirmed since Breyer — Chief Justice John Roberts — has received more than 69 percent of the Senate’s votes, and Roberts is also the only one to have earned the backing of a majority of the other party’s senators.</p>

</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/nominations/judge-parker-nomination-rejected.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to say that</a> Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2016/03/legal-history-highlight-the-failed-election-year-nomination-of-abe-fortas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nomination processes</a> always <a href="https://www.oyez.org/justices/clarence_thomas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went smoothly</a> prior to Breyer, and the Senate has rejected nominees or only narrowly confirmed them many times in the past, but as Princeton University political scientist <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/jkastellec/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Kastellec</a>’s data of Senate votes on high-court nominees since the nation’s founding shows, most nominees were overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate. In fact, about half of all Supreme Court nomination votes have been <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/voting.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voice votes</a>, with no tally of individual votes — typically an indication of little or no opposition, as a senator would likely call for a recorded vote otherwise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those days are long gone, though. Since Breyer’s confirmation, four of the seven confirmed justices received less than 60 percent overall support in the Senate, and those four each earned support from less than 10 percent of the opposing party’s senators. This includes all three of former President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court picks, who progressively received less bipartisan backing: <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1151/vote_115_1_00111.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neil Gorsuch got just two</a> Democratic yeas in April 2017, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1152/vote_115_2_00223.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brett Kavanaugh one</a> in October 2018 and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1162/vote_116_2_00224.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Coney Barrett zero</a> in October 2020. In fact, Barrett’s lack of cross-party support marked the first time since 1869 that a Supreme Court nominee failed to garner a single vote from the other party. And with all three of Trump’s picks, they were confirmed only because of a Republican majority in the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now it's Democrats’ turn to push their nominee, but they have even less margin for error than Republicans did during Trump’s tenure. Whereas Republicans always had at least one vote they could afford to lose, Democrats in a 50-50 Senate can’t spare a single vote.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes two independent senators, Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucus with the Democrats. Democrats have the majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> It’s why <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/30/598115811/the-fall-of-harriet-miers-a-cautionary-tale-for-dr-ronny-jackson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any hiccup in the nomination process</a>, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/upshot/democrats-agenda-hinges-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some sort of health issue</a> for a Democratic senator, could create real problems for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As my colleague Nathaniel Rakich <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-and-kyrsten-sinema-will-probably-vote-for-bidens-supreme-court-pick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently wrote for this site</a>, there’s reason to think that all 50 Democrats will back Biden’s eventual pick, despite their recent trouble passing legislative priorities, such as Biden’s social spending plan and voting rights bill. And there’s some indication that a Republican senator or two might consider voting for the nominee, too. But at the same time, more moderate members of the GOP caucus, such as Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, could give way to intraparty pressure to oppose Biden’s pick. Collins, for her part, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/collins-bidens-handling-scotus-vacancy-clumsy-best/story?id=82553277" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently criticized</a> how Biden had gone about publicly promising to nominate a Black woman for Breyer’s spot on the court, while Murkowski faces a tough reelection battle and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may want to avoid further irritating</a> her already-frustrated party base.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this comes within the confines of the increased polarization in our politics, too, which has simply upped the ante on Supreme Court appointments. In fact, conflicts of the judicial branch are among the best illustrations of how the Senate has become more partisan, more majoritarian and less consensus-driven. First, in 2013, facing Republican opposition to judges nominated by Barack Obama, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid backed the “<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/harry-reid-nuclear-option-100199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear option</a>” to require simple majorities to confirm lower-court nominees. Then, in 2016, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the new majority leader, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/merrick-garland-senate-republicans-timeline/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevented a vote</a> on Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, in the hopes of keeping a seat open for a potential GOP president to fill — which is exactly how it panned out. To confirm conservative justices like Gorsuch (and those after him), McConnell <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/04/06/522847700/senate-pulls-nuclear-trigger-to-ease-gorsuch-confirmation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded the use of simple majorities</a> to confirm Supreme Court justices as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now we face the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/26/supreme-court-confirmation-congress-00002420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential scenario</a> where the Senate confirms a Supreme Court nominee on a 50-50 vote with the vice president breaking the tie. That may or may not happen with Biden’s eventual choice, but it hangs out there as a distinct possibility because of the polarized times we live in. And that reality reflects the new normal of close, mostly party-line votes for nominees to the Supreme Court.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It’s Supreme Court nomination season again. Last week, Justice Stephen Breyer announced that he will retire from the court at the end of the term, and President Biden has said he will name his nominee by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/27/us/stephen-breyer-supreme-court-retire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of February</a>. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/30/1076798457/biden-may-fulfill-a-campaign-promise-to-black-voters-with-his-supreme-court-nomi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In keeping with a campaign promise</a>, Biden is widely expected to nominate a Black woman, too, with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/28/1076579467/biden-supreme-court-nominee-breyer-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible replacements including</a> Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Leondra Kruger, a justice on the California Supreme Court; and J. Michelle Childs, a district court judge in South Carolina — among others.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court would make history, but this hasn’t <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/27/biden-scotus-pick-conservative-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped some from criticizing Biden</a> for limiting his search to candidates of one specific gender and race. Underlying those complaints is the assumption that a Black woman would be less qualified than other potential nominees, but our analysis shows just how flawed that assumption is. We looked at data from the Federal Judicial Center and found that while Biden is indeed diversifying the courts — in just one year, he’s appointed 24 percent of the Black women on the federal bench — it’s simply not true that he’s weighing diversity more highly than the qualifications usually used to evaluate judges. In fact, his lower-court appointees are arguably <em>more</em> highly qualified on those metrics than the judges selected by previous presidents, and that’s particularly true of the Black women he’s named.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This past December, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-is-reshaping-the-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when we assessed how well Biden was delivering</a> on his promise of expanding the diversity of the courts, we found that the vast majority of his appointees were people of color. Almost two months later, an additional 14 judges have been confirmed — bringing the number of Biden appointees to 42 — and Biden’s judicial appointees are still far more diverse than previous presidents’ appointees.</p>

So far, more than one-quarter (26 percent) of Biden’s appointees are Black women, including five Black women who were nominated to serve on appeals courts. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1100" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/atd.mejia_.COURTS-UPDATE.01XX-2.png" alt="Waffle chart showing the share of appointed Black women appellate or district judges by president since Jimmy Carter. Over one-fourth of Biden’s judges so far have been Black women, more than any other president since Carter." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/atd.mejia_.COURTS-UPDATE.01XX-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/atd.mejia_.COURTS-UPDATE.01XX-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/atd.mejia_.COURTS-UPDATE.01XX-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">To put it another way, Black women comprise only 6 percent of active federal judges — and 24 percent were appointed by Biden in the year since he took office. Perhaps even more strikingly, five of the nine Black women who are currently serving as appeals court judges were appointed by Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden is diversifying the courts in other ways, too. According to our analysis, many of Biden’s appointees have professional backgrounds that aren’t typical for federal judges. In the past, a common pathway for judges was to work as a prosecutor: About 40 percent of Obama’s appointees and Trump’s appointees had worked as a prosecutor at one point or another. Biden’s appointees are different, though. They’re much less likely to have worked in prosecution — and more more likely to have worked in advocacy and public defense.</p>

In fact, when it comes to education, Biden’s appointees are even more highly credentialed than other presidents’ appointees. Nearly 30 percent of Biden appointees attended Ivy League universities for their undergraduate degree, and nearly 60 percent attended a top-ranked law school.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Rather than being less qualified than their white counterparts, Black women are actually <em>more</em> highly credentialed than the average Biden judge. We found that Black women were particularly likely to have attended an elite institution. More than one-third (36 percent) of Black women that Biden named to the courts attended an Ivy League university, and 82 percent attended a top-ranked law school.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For top-ranked law schools, we used the top-14 schools that appear on the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 list&lt;/a&gt; compiled by U.S. News and World Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a> Black women also stood out among Biden’s appointees on another metric commonly used to assess judges: <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/committees/federal_judiciary/ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ratings produced by the American Bar Association</a> for federal judicial nominees. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, we found that Black judges actually had lower ABA ratings than white judges, but that shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that they’re less qualified. <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/files/how_judicial_qualification_ratings_may_disadvantage_minority_and_female_candidates.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political scientists have found</a> that minority judicial nominees tend to receive lower ratings than white nominees, even controlling for education and experience. The vast majority (82 percent) of the Black women nominated by Biden received the ABA’s highest rating when they were first nominated to the federal bench, however. That’s all the more impressive when you factor in that it’s harder for Black judicial nominees to receive a high ABA rating.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This shows that Biden isn’t sacrificing traditional qualifications in pursuit of diversity. If anything, he seems to be prioritizing Black women with highly burnished legal resumes for judicial appointments — perhaps doing so in anticipation of exactly the kinds of complaints about “diversity picks” that we’re already seeing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the potential nominees to replace Breyer are very similar to the federal judges Biden has appointed so far. Like Biden’s other judges, the potential nominees tend to have worked in public defense or public service; Jackson is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/us/politics/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former public defender</a>, and Kruger <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/justice-leondra-r-kruger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked in the Obama administration</a>. The potential nominees also have plenty of traditional qualifications, like Ivy League degrees, experience as judges, high ratings from national and state bar associations and Supreme Court clerkships. In fact, Jackson and Kruger are very similar to the Supreme Court’s current justices, most of whom attended Ivy League universities or law schools, clerked for another Supreme Court justice and served as federal judges. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, there’s a case to be made that having so little educational and professional diversity on the Supreme Court is actually a bad thing. Justice Clarence Thomas, who attended Yale for law school <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-thomas/clarence-thomas-reconciles-with-yale-after-bitter-years-idUSBRE84T1KE20120530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but wrote that he stores the degree</a> in his basement with a 15-cent sticker on the frame, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/clarence-thomas-trump/593596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has gone out of his way</a> to hire clerks who didn’t attend Ivy League schools, <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/when-it-comes-to-hiring-scotus-clerks-clarence-thomas-still-doesnt-give-a-damn-about-the-u-s-news-rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguing</a> that the legal profession’s bias toward elite schools doesn’t produce better lawyers. South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn has argued that potential Breyer-replacement nominee Childs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/j-michelle-childs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a southerner with a blue-collar background</a>, would add more value to the court than yet another Ivy-educated lawyer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even so, it’s indisputable that all of Biden’s appointees are highly qualified to serve on the federal courts, as are his potential Supreme Court nominees. Meanwhile, they offer other kinds of diversity that are rare on the current court — and in the federal judiciary as a whole.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Decades of polling have suggested that, in general, more Americans sympathize with the Democratic Party than with the Republican Party. This advantage has been so durable that it’s become conventional wisdom in American politics. But a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Gallup poll</a> shows Republicans taking the lead over Democrats, 47 percent to 42 percent, in terms of how Americans identify. The poll has been the subject of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/opinion/gallup-poll-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of commentary</a>, and in this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses whether those takeaways and underlying data are a “good or bad use of polling.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The team also talks about the Senate races in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia and New Hampshire and debates which are most important in determining control of the upper chamber next year.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">One of the biggest takeaways from the congressional redistricting process thus far has been that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-countless-confusing-sometimes-contradictory-takeaways-of-the-2021-22-redistricting-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither party has made major gains</a>. But the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/democratic_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional map</a> that New York legislators just introduced is so skewed toward Democrats that it could single-handedly change that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">New York is, of course, a blue state; it gave President Biden 61 percent of the vote in the 2020 presidential election. But if it becomes law (a good possibility but far from a certainty; read on), this map would put Democrats in position to win between 77 percent and 85 percent of New York’s congressional seats. The map creates 20 districts with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> of D+5 or bluer and only four districts with partisan leans of R+5 or redder. There would also be only two highly competitive districts (between D+5 and R+5), and both of those would tilt toward Democrats too (with partisan leans of D+3 and D+4).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/newyork.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/newyork.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/newyork.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/newyork.png?w=1400 2x"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s three more Democratic-leaning seats, and three fewer Republican-leaning seats, than the current congressional map has — a pretty big shift for just one state! Right now, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationally</a>, seven additional Democratic-leaning seats and one additional Republican-leaning seat have been created from redistricting. (The number of highly competitive seats, though, has dropped by six.) If this map is enacted, it would dramatically widen the gap between the two parties to +10 seats for Democrats and minus two seats for Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I had previously calculated that redistricting alone would hand Republicans two new House seats (give or take) in the 2022 midterms, while Democrats would roughly stand pat. (This is before accounting for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely Republican-leaning national political environment</a>.) Add this map to the mix, though, and Democrats would be poised to gain about three seats nationally and Republicans would be poised to lose around two. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because this map puts New York Democrats in good position to flip two Republican-held open seats: the 1st District on Long Island (which moves from a partisan lean of R+10 to D+6) and the new 22nd District<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly numbered the 24th District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> around Syracuse (which moves from D+4 to D+13). It also all but dooms Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis in the Staten Island-based 11th District (which moves from R+13 to D+7) and dismantles Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney’s old, heavily Republican district. (She <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2022/01/rep-claudia-tenney-will-run-in-new-gop-leaning-district-giving-up-utica-area.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Monday</a> she would seek reelection in the open 23rd District instead.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In general, though, New York Democrats were ruthlessly efficient at drawing this map. The Cook Political Report’s <a href="https://twitter.com/redistrict/status/1487923726754717697?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Wasserman</a> found only a few places where the map could be tweaked to shore up Democrats, and even then, the potential gains were minimal. The map was also cleverly designed to minimize the risk that any light-blue districts could fall to Republicans in a red-wave election. The two Democrats who represent the two most vulnerable districts under this map (the two highly-competitive-but-Democratic-tilting seats) are Reps. Antonio Delgado and Sean Patrick Maloney. Delgado was one of House Democrats’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-strongest-house-candidates-in-2020-were-mostly-moderate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest incumbents in 2020</a>, running 10 percentage points ahead of Biden, while Maloney is the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and therefore will have access to googobs (a technical term) of money. The next-most competitive districts, the 1st and 11th, are probably too blue for Republicans to win under normal conditions, though it would be possible in a very pro-Republican year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that New York could end up with such an egregious congressional map represents a failure for the state’s <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new redistricting process</a>. In 2014, New Yorkers <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/New_York_Redistricting_Commission_Amendment,_Proposal_1_(2014)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted</a> to create a bipartisan redistricting commission tasked with drawing new congressional maps and submitting them to the legislature. However, this commission proved unable to agree on a single map. In its first round of map-drawing, the commission’s Democratic members and Republican members each <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/01/03/nys-independent-redistricting-commission-sends-maps-to-the-legislature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended a different map</a> — both of which were <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2022/01/new-york-lawmakers-reject-redistricting-plans-from-bipartisan-commission.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted down</a> by the legislature. In its second round of map-drawing, the commission <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-redistricting-commission-state-legislature-20220124-7gmarf3vxnajhk4oh6v2jgp42y-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to submit <em>any</em> maps to the legislature</a>, with each party’s commissioners accusing the other of acting in bad faith.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the commission was likely doomed from the start, anyway, because its recommendations were totally nonbinding. If the legislature voted down both the commission’s first- and second-round maps, the legislature could simply draw its own map — which, of course, is what it did. (Republicans on the redistricting commission argued that this was the reason Democratic commissioners didn’t compromise on a map.) It’s yet another reminder that redistricting reforms <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/did-redistricting-commissions-live-up-to-their-promise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">need to be well designed</a> to have their intended effect.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because the same party (Democrats) controls both the New York state Senate and state Assembly, this map most likely<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_justinlevitt_/status/1157144826363572224" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;somewhat ambiguous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>12</sup></a> needs to receive two-thirds support in both chambers in order to pass. This is another provision of that 2014 ballot measure meant to get new maps to pass with bipartisan support — except it, too, was fundamentally flawed, since if the party in power had a legislative supermajority, no opposition-party votes would be required. And right now, New York Democrats do indeed have supermajorities in both chambers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, this map’s passage isn’t guaranteed. Democrats’ supermajority in the state Senate is narrow; they have <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/senators-committees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43 seats</a>, but the two-thirds threshold is 42 (out of 63 total seats). That means only two Democrats would need to vote against the map to sink its chances. This isn’t outside the realm of possibility. One of the chamber’s Democrats, state Sen. Simcha Felder, is quite conservative and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/nyregion/simcha-felder-senate-brooklyn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often votes with Republicans</a>. And some liberal Democrats may find it too hypocritical to vote for such a biased map when Democrats have branded themselves so strongly as the party of fair maps in recent years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if the proposal passes, that doesn’t necessarily mean it will survive legal muster. Just as Democrats have sued to overturn Republican-biased maps in states like North Carolina and Ohio, Republicans would presumably file a lawsuit against this map for being a partisan gerrymander. The <a href="https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2022/01/Constitution-January-1-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York state constitution</a> states, “Districts shall not be drawn to discourage competition or for the purpose of favoring or disfavoring incumbents or other particular candidates or political parties.” It also requires districts to be contiguous and “as compact … as practicable,” criteria that certain districts in the new map may not satisfy. For instance, the <a href="https://twitter.com/RRHElections/status/1488049453244239872?s=20&amp;t=NONkF84bf-ChxvvXnSIrxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new 3rd District</a> jumps across the Long Island Sound to connect Westchester County and Long Island, while the <a href="https://twitter.com/RRHElections/status/1488010584075427841?s=20&amp;t=NONkF84bf-ChxvvXnSIrxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new 10th District</a> snakes from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear what chance such a lawsuit would have of succeeding, considering that the seven judges on New York’s highest court were <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_of_New_York_Court_of_Appeals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all appointed by Democratic governors</a>. But what’s certain is that it’s too hasty to consider this map a done deal.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-year-in-bidens-approval-rating-is-in-troubleonly-trumps-was-lower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden</a> has had <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/manchin-bidens-build-back-social-spending-plan/story?id=81843089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a couple</a> of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-failed-voting-rights-push-is-a-setback-for-democracy-and-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rough months</a>, but on Wednesday, he was thrown a lifeline with the news that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-breyer-tried-to-compromise-on-an-increasingly-uncompromising-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Stephen Breyer plans to retire</a> from the Supreme Court at the end of its current term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Getting to nominate a Supreme Court justice is a big deal for Democrats, too, as liberal justices haven’t always <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/briefing/stephen-breyer-retirement-biden-nomination.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left the bench at an opportune time</a> (the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg is just the most recent example). It’ll be a history-making appointment, too, because Biden is expected to honor his campaign promise of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/supreme-court-nominee-black-woman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointing a Black woman to the court</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s discuss the effects we expect Democrats’ Supreme Court nomination to have:</p>



<ol><li>First, can Democrats <em>actually</em> get their nominee through? The nomination process for Supreme Court justices <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-supreme-courts-reputation-is-at-stake/">has become increasingly rancorous</a>. What are the stakes in this process?</li><li>Second, while the timeline for when Breyer’s replacement will be appointed isn’t clear yet, what effects do we think this will have on the midterm elections — especially given that it’s likely to coincide with what was already going to be a very high-profile term for the court?</li><li>Finally, let’s talk about the overall importance of whomever Biden nominates to the court. Liberal justices will still be in the minority, but whomever Biden nominates will nevertheless play an important role in shaping the court.</li></ol>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with that first question. Democrats can get their Supreme Court nominee through … right?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/amelia-thomson-deveaux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</a>, senior writer): If the Democrats can’t get this nominee through, they should just pack up and go home.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> I’m serious! They’ve got the votes, they’ve got time, they’ve been holding together on other judicial nominees. If they can’t make this happen, then that’s a sign of much bigger dysfunction than what we’re seeing currently on legislation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Who knows when they’ll be able to get another Democratic nominee onto the court?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): Well, the good news for Democrats is that Republicans can’t block a Supreme Court nomination in the judiciary committee or on the floor as long as all 50 Senate Democrats — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/us/politics/democrats-filibuster-sinema-manchin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m looking at you, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema</a>! — hold their ground and back Biden’s nominee. Based on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-and-kyrsten-sinema-will-probably-vote-for-bidens-supreme-court-pick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel’s recent story</a>, that seems likely, but you really never know.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): Yeah, despite Manchin’s and Sinema’s high-profile defections from the party on major votes lately, I found — somewhat surprisingly — that no Senate Democrat has ever voted against any of Biden’s federal-court nominees so far. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The caucus has been remarkably cohesive and unified on the issue of judges:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Manchin also <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1486739215513800708" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said last week</a> that he’d support a justice who is more liberal than he is — which is a good sign that Democrats will be able to get this through. And it’s also not completely out of the question that a handful of Senate Republicans back Biden’s nominee! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I was pretty shocked at <a href="https://twitter.com/AC360/status/1486510820817354752?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Majority Whip James Clyburn’s claim</a> that the two Republican senators from South Carolina — Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott — would potentially back Democrats if Biden tapped J. Michelle Childs for the role.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> You found that a couple Republicans might cross the aisle, right, Nathaniel? At least based on how judicial votes have been going so far?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Right, Amelia. Sen. Susan Collins has voted for Biden’s judicial nominees 86 percent of the time, Sen. Lisa Murkowski has voted for them 85 percent of the time and Graham — who is kind of old-fashioned in that he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/583111-graham-emerges-as-go-to-ally-for-bidens-judicial-picks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still defers to the president on his nominees</a>, the way senators used to do 30 years ago — has voted for them 84 percent of the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> But do we think that analysis of federal judicial nominees will be applicable to the Supreme Court? Asking as maybe the biggest thing working against Democrats is that the nomination process for a Supreme Court justice has become increasingly rancorous, meaning they can’t really count on any GOP support, right?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Appeals court nominations are also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-is-reshaping-the-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting more rancorous</a>, though, Sarah. Judicial nominations in general are just getting more acrimonious — but this is <em>so</em> high-stakes that it seems unlikely to me that Democrats would fall apart here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I think that’s right, Sarah — for instance, I doubt Murkowski, who is up for reelection this year, will want to anger the Republican base by casting such a high-profile vote in Biden’s favor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But I also think there’s less incentive for Republicans to block this nominee than usual. Control of the court isn’t at stake, since this would be going from a liberal judge to a liberal judge, and conservatives’ majority is pretty secure now at 6-3. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst): Yeah, this might be the last time Democrats have control of the Senate when a Supreme Court vacancy occurs <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/05/18/the-democrats-2024-senate-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for some time</a>, so this is a pretty pivotal appointment for them to not screw up. And as Nathaniel’s analysis found, there’s probably a good chance they remain united. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, if a Democrat or two breaks from the party line, counting on Republican support could be dicey. If we look back at recent confirmation votes, they’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/JKastellec/status/1486420566424707075?s=20&amp;t=QoHhTIK2_7wWAAW5SmPwOA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become increasingly close</a> because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-supreme-courts-reputation-is-at-stake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer and fewer senators cross the aisle</a> to back the other party’s nominee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> If Democrats can’t get this nomination through and they lose the Senate in November, Breyer doesn’t have to leave. He conditioned his retirement on his successor being nominated and confirmed. But he’s retiring now for a reason — he’s in his 80s — and who knows when the Democrats will control the White House and the Senate again. It’s possible that if Breyer can’t retire now, a Republican president will end up replacing him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ll never say never — politics now is too weird for me to bet the farm on anything. But this <em>really</em> is Democrats’ seat to lose, and they have to know that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, we’ve talked about how important every vote is in the nomination process, but what are some of the other stakes of this process, especially considering Biden has said he plans to uphold his promise to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> There’s probably a strategic reason behind the White House <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/white-house-confirms-that-biden-will-pick-black-woman-for-supreme-court-seat-202811727.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasting no time</a> confirming that Biden would follow through on his campaign promise to nominate a Black woman. I wouldn’t be surprised if they view this as a motivator for Black voters — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/us/politics/biden-approval-ratings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who are souring on Biden’s presidency</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Black women are <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26855823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most reliable</a> voting bloc <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/21/politics/black-women-voters-michigan/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for Democrats</a>, and such an appointment would make history. So politically, on top of Biden’s previous campaign promise, this makes a lot of sense. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There have been a lot of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/27/biden-scotus-pick-conservative-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ridiculous takes on the right</a> about the nature of this appointment being promised to a Black woman, but that ignores the fact that presidents <a href="https://twitter.com/billscher/status/1486764491744464906?s=20&amp;t=QoHhTIK2_7wWAAW5SmPwOA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have historically considered identity when making appointments</a>. President Ronald Reagan <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/supreme-court-women-history-reagan-biden-nominees-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised to appoint a woman</a>, for instance, and chose Sandra Day O’Connor; George H.W. Bush <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/07/02/bush-picks-thomas-for-supreme-court/943b9fda-e079-405e-974e-14c2d0cd999b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed Clarence Thomas</a> to succeed another Black man, Thurgood Marshall.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> To your point, Geoff, the racial breakdown of Supreme Court members over time is pretty striking: Of the 115 justices who have served, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/politics/supreme-court-justice-minorities-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but seven</a> (Thomas, Marshall, Sonia Sotomayor, O’Connor, Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Amy Coney Barrett) have been white men.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> A handful of Black women <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/shortlist-breyer-replacement-supreme-court/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are being floated</a> as possible replacements for Breyer, and three of them — Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who’s currently an appeals court judge on the D.C. Circuit; Justice Leondra Kruger, who’s a justice on the California Supreme Court; and Judge J. Michelle Childs, who’s a district court judge in South Carolina — appear to be the top contenders.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if I had to pick, I would bet on Jackson being the nominee. She has <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+KBJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the right credentials</a> — two degrees from Harvard, extensive judicial experience, even a clerkship with Breyer himself! And Biden appeared to be teeing her up for this spot by nominating her to the D.C. Circuit last year — it’s often a feeder to the Supreme Court. (Justices Thomas, John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh all served on the D.C. Circuit before the Supreme Court.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Geoffrey raises an interesting point: How much is this appointment meant to play to Democrats’ base? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Alex pointed out, Biden and Democrats have taken a hit recently with Black voters. Thinking ahead to the 2022 midterms — the timing of when the nomination vote will actually happen is still unclear, but assuming it will be <em>relatively</em> close to the midterms — how much does a party’s base care about Supreme Court nominations?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I also think one thing that’s particularly complicated about this nomination process is that this term has already had <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of high-profile</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-supreme-court-probably-doesnt-care-what-most-americans-think-about-abortion-or-gun-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contentious cases</a>. Will those cases weigh more in voters’ minds?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Some polling taken over the last few years suggests that the Supreme Court has never been a top priority for either Republican or Democratic voters. In 2020, for instance, shortly after former President Donald Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-election-2020-courts-e802e13e79b958df7f53418029717073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a short list</a> of potential Supreme Court nominees, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/09/17/supreme-court-polling-2020-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> found that only 48 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans said the Supreme Court was “very important” in deciding their vote that year. I realize 48 percent and 50 percent aren’t nothing, but at the time, it ranked below issues like the economy, health care, national security, taxes and COVID-19 for members of both parties.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Supreme Court nominations have traditionally been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/republicans-are-usually-more-fired-over-scotus-now-polls-say-n1240574" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an issue that’s mattered more to Republicans</a>. But there’s evidence that Democrats are <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/01/27/marquette-law-poll-guide-justice-breyer-data-from-u-s-supreme-court-surveys-2019-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tuning more into the importance of the court</a>, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if the court overturns Roe v. Wade or expands gun rights this term, that will definitely focus negative attention on the justices as both would be <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of step with public opinion</a>. Overturning Roe in particular <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be highly unpopular</a>. There aren’t many issues that could plausibly cause a backlash against the court, just because so much of what they do is technical and under-the-radar, but that’s one of the big ones.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> I think where the Supreme Court pick matters when looking ahead to the midterms is that it’s a chance for Biden to make history and receive some positive coverage in the process. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could help shore up his base, which <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-joe-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been flagging</a>, as Alex mentioned earlier. (Maybe it even helps Biden regain <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some support among independents</a>, where he’s really lost support.) I’m not sure it’s the sort of thing that can <em>dramatically</em> change the trajectory of his approval rating, but it could tick up slightly afterward.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I agree with that, Geoffrey. A successful confirmation would also be a concrete win for Biden that could change this narrative of incompetence and failure he’s been stuck in.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I don’t really think this nomination fight will affect the midterms much, though. If anything, it makes the Supreme Court less relevant for the midterms. As long as Breyer was still on the court, Democrats had an argument for saying, “You have to keep us in control of the Senate so we can appoint a liberal justice to replace Breyer!” Now, they can’t make that argument.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> My feeling is that the bigger question here is what the court’s conservatives do. If the term ends up to be less headline-making than court watchers are expecting, I’m not sure how much people will care. After all, this isn’t a liberal replacing a conservative — <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/01/27/marquette-law-poll-guide-justice-breyer-data-from-u-s-supreme-court-surveys-2019-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most people don’t even know who Breyer is</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yeah, that’s a good point, Amelia. But if the court is as conservative as court watchers expect, the timing could be an important factor here, too. We did find, after all, that Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-kavanaugh-helping-republicans-midterm-chances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affected the 2018 midterms</a>, especially in Senate races. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> We can’t rule out the possibility, either, that this motivates Republicans more than Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that the White House made it clear early on that Biden intended to stick to his word and nominate a Black woman already has <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/foxs-tomi-lahren-suggests-biden-chose-vp-harris-based-race-will-do-same-scotus-1673366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some Republicans up in arms</a>, and I think that, especially <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-backlash-is-a-type-of-racial-reckoning-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after the “racial reckoning” of 2020</a>, there are a lot of white voters who are angry about their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/georgia-senate-trump-black-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived loss of power and status</a>. Replacing a white man with a Black woman — even if they are similar ideologically — could stir up angst among conservatives who already believed they were losing political clout to Black voters. As Geoff mentioned earlier, there have already been a number of racist takes from GOP pundits that I’m going to refrain from linking to, but I can only imagine how bad things will get from here …</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If it’s not about race (which I doubt), I’d expect the GOP to simply attack Biden’s appointee as too liberal. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1486399859129212937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already tweeted</a> that Biden faces a choice of nominating either “someone who loves America and believes in the Constitution” or “a woke activist.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Yeah, Alex, I think this is going to be a nasty confirmation hearing. There are already people attacking Biden for appointing a “less qualified” person — before he’s even named his nominee! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even though we found that Biden is actually <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-is-reshaping-the-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominating more Ivy League and top law-school grads</a> than previous presidents, this is a familiar trope for women of color in lots of professions, not just law. You have to be the best of the best to make it to the top — and people still question your credentials.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Exactly. And Republicans are also already reminding voters that the court should be a factor for voters this fall. Just look at Graham’s <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1486399048584212484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet thread on this</a> from a few days ago.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’d expect that Republicans double down on this argument, particularly in competitive states where Democratic senators are defending their seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> I guess the flip side of what you’re saying, though, Alex,<strong> </strong>is that a confirmation hearing where the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court is subjected to a bunch of racist questioning about her qualifications could make Democratic voters pretty angry, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Definitely a potential boost for the GOP, although I wonder how much more energized can Republicans get? They’re already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to turn out in a midterm</a> with a Democrat in the White House, and if the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/resist-the-pundits-what-the-2021-elections-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 gubernatorial elections were any indication</a>, turnout will likely be very high again for a midterm this November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> This is a bit of a nerdy point, but I’ll be interested to see how the hearings go. Traditionally, nominees <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/daily-videos/why-do-supreme-court-nominees-avoid-answering-so-many-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studiously avoid saying</a> what they think about any high-profile issue or precedent that comes before the court. And that makes the hearings pretty snoozy for the most part. But in a moment when precedents like Roe v. Wade are actively threatened — does that change?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Probably not, but it’ll be more complex for the nominee to navigate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Fair question, Amelia. If the nominee were to make more assertive comments on a topic like Roe, I could imagine that getting a lot of play on the news. I’m not sure whether that’s good or bad for one party or the other, though — maybe it reminds some Democratic voters of the stakes for the court, but it could also, to Alex’s point, further energize social conservatives to show up in the midterms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> On that point, let’s talk a little bit more about the overall importance of whomever Biden nominates to the court. As Amelia flagged, the court is currently in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-conservative-6-3-majority-would-reshape-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the throes of a 6-3 conservative revolution</a>. That isn’t going to change with whomever Biden nominates — liberal justices will still be in the minority — but this justice, whoever she might be, will still play an important role in shaping the court. Let’s talk about that a little more and what the consequences of that are.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Breyer was very much <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-breyer-tried-to-compromise-on-an-increasingly-uncompromising-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an old-school Supreme Court justice</a>. He staked out a place on the court’s center-left and tried to compromise with the conservatives on some big issues, like religious liberty. He basically spent the last year trying to convince Americans that the court is nonpartisan. Of course, that’s a line we’ve heard from other justices recently too. But it felt with Breyer that he was trying to operate on a court that no longer existed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Someone like Jackson, on the other hand, is presumably well aware of the political moment. She was the judge in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/26/20983827/trump-house-subpoena-mcgahn-jackson-judiciary-testify" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a case that came out of Democrats’ investigation</a> into special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Remember that thing that feels like it happened 75 years ago?) So you’d imagine her potentially staking out a position more like Sotomayor, who has been calling out the conservative justices right and left this term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00618.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s evidence</a>, too, that diversity makes a difference in cases on issues like affirmative action — at least on lower courts. And the court just so happens to have taken an affirmative action case for what will likely be next term. Do I really think that will change the outcome on this Supreme Court? Probably not. The conservative justices have been <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-takes-cases-future-affirmative-action/story?id=78255962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gunning for affirmative action</a> for years. But having another nonwhite justice could affect how they handle the case.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> One thing that I always thought was interesting about the Supreme Court is that, historically, whether a justice was appointed by a Republican or Democratic president <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-justices-get-more-liberal-as-they-get-older/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t super predictive</a> of where they’d end up ideologically. I’m curious, Amelia: Do you think that era is over?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, is there <em>any</em> chance for one of the conservative justices to get more liberal over their tenure, or vice versa?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> That era is definitely over, Nathaniel. It ended along with the era of unanimous votes for Supreme Court nominees.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some people say <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-chief-justice-roberts-a-secret-liberal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roberts is getting more liberal</a>. I am not in that camp. I think what’s happening is that he cares about institutional credibility, and as the court gets more conservative, it’s getting increasingly out of step with public opinion. That’s where his breaks with the conservatives (which are few and far between) come from.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> It does kind of feel like Roberts is standing still and it’s the other conservative justices who are moving — to the right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> The conservative legal movement has spent the past 40 years <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/the-conservative-pipeline-to-the-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working to get justices on the court</a> who won’t get more liberal. It seems like they’ve been extraordinarily successful.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yeah, Amelia, it’s hard to see outcomes on the Supreme Court changing anytime soon. It’ll be interesting, though, to see what this means for the three liberal justices — and most likely three liberal female justices — to be in the minority for years to come.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> What it means for the liberals, Sarah, is that they have to figure out how to make being in the minority work for them. Breyer’s approach (and also Kagan’s) was to try to stanch the bleeding — keep the court from moving to the right too quickly and compromise with conservatives to get not-terrible outcomes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that approach actually resulted in some pretty big concessions for the liberal justices, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/us/supreme-court-gay-rights-foster-care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last term’s religious-liberty case</a>. And I don’t see a lot of evidence that the conservative justices — with the exception of Roberts — are interested in compromising with the liberal justices on anything at this point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So I would suspect we’re going to see a lot more of dissents like <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-s-sotomayor-calls-texas-abortion-case-disaster-blistering-n1287822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the one we just got from Sotomayor</a>, who said that the court’s decision to let Texas’s highly restrictive abortion law stay in effect was a “disaster.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> It’s interesting to me that we’re seeing basically the same institutional dynamics play out on the Supreme Court that we’ve seen in Congress over the past decade: the rise of a conservative wing that is <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/18/farm-bill-fails-597661" target="_blank" rel="noopener">totally uninterested in compromise</a> (the Freedom Caucus), and now a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/us/politics/pelosi-infrastructure-house-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more assertive progressive wing</a>, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Yeah, Nathaniel, I also wonder if it will lead to a growing perception among Americans that the court is political. I think that’s an increasingly unavoidable conclusion. But if Americans start to think that way — how does it change their perception of unelected justices who serve for life and rule on some of the country’s most important issues? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Don’t Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354908/approval-supreme-court-down-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already think that</a>, Amelia?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Well, look at <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress’s approval rating</a>, though! The Supreme Court is still doing a lot better, relatively speaking.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it is relevant that more Americans are seeing the court as too conservative. That being said, Gallup found that only 37 percent of Americans have that view.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Interestingly, that Gallup poll didn’t find a huge partisan split on approval of the Supreme Court; as of September 2021, 45 percent of Republicans approved of the court, while 36 percent of Democrats did. I feel like that is the next frontier for public opinion. Especially if the court overturns Roe v. Wade and delivers other conservative victories this term, I bet you’ll see its approval skyrocket among Republicans and plummet among Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> The fact that most of the Supreme Court’s cases — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-right-turn-goes-way-beyond-guns-and-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even important ones</a> — are highly technical works in their favor here. It’s easy for them to do radical things, like diminish the power of federal agencies, without anyone really understanding what they’re doing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But I think some of that is already happening, Nathaniel. The question for me is whether the court does something so obviously political that public opinion really starts to mirror the polarized nature of the court.</p>]]></description>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">For the past eight years, it’s been pretty easy for most Americans to forget about the simmering conflict between Russia and Ukraine. But the war — which began in 2014 when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/ukraine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russian forces annexed Crimea</a> and pro-Russian separatists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/world/europe/ukraine-russia-novoazovsk-crimea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seized control of parts of eastern Ukraine</a> — is suddenly front and center, after Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/07/world/europe/ukraine-maps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dispatched around 100,000 troops to the border with Ukraine</a>. Now a conflict that has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/russia-ukraine-conflict-photos-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already claimed roughly 14,000 lives</a> could be poised to escalate dramatically, with President Biden and other European leaders <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/22/ukraine-russia-military-weapons-nato-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promising support for Ukraine</a> if Russia invades.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/world/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urging residents to stay calm</a>. “What’s new? Isn’t this the reality for the past eight years?” he said in an address last week. But polling from Ukraine suggests that Ukrainians have grown increasingly suspicious of Russian aggression as the conflict has dragged on. They also remain firmly committed to their own sovereignty — the vast majority of Ukrainians do not want to be part of Russia. At the same time, several polls suggest that Ukrainians are more open to an alliance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) than they were in the past. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-says-it-remains-be-seen-if-ukraine-will-be-n1270807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That possibility isn’t formally on the table right now</a>, but experts on Ukrainian politics and public opinion told me that support for NATO membership is often a rough stand-in for Ukrainians’ feelings about a military alliance with the west. Most Americans are also wary about Russia, according to recent polling — but they’re more divided about whether U.S. involvement is a good idea, and whether the conflict is a threat to U.S. interests.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the over thirty years since Ukraine became an independent democracy, the country has been through a fair amount of turmoil — <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25210230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a revolution in 2004</a>, <a href="https://www.fpri.org/research/eurasia/recent-findings/ukraine-global-econ-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an economic crisis</a> a few years later, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30131108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another revolution in 2014</a>, and of course the ongoing conflict with Russia. Experts told me that Ukrainians have been forming a stronger national identity over that time, including in eastern parts of the country where Russian is spoken widely. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-russia-ukraine-invasion-nato-biden-rcna13245" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin has argued</a> that Ukraine is historically and culturally part of Russia — a claim that underlies his repeated efforts to expand Russia’s influence — but all of the experts I spoke with told me that this isn’t the way most Ukrainians see things. “More people say that they feel strongly Ukrainian, they’re proud to be Ukrainian citizens — even if they continue to speak Russian language,” said <a href="https://tymobrik.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tymofii Brik</a>, a public opinion researcher and assistant professor at Kyiv School of Economics. “There is a very strong feeling of sovereignty and national identity.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t mean that Ukrainians have a history of hostility toward Russia. As the chart below shows, Ukrainians held very positive feelings toward Russia as recently as 2008. But all of that changed when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and began a long, grinding war on the country’s eastern border. According to <a href="http://kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=1015&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS)</a>, Ukrainian attitudes toward Russia got much more negative around the time of the invasion of Crimea, and haven’t recovered since. “It’s not that Ukrainians are anti-Russian,” said <a href="https://eksperty.org/experts/olexiy-haran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olexiy Haran</a>, a professor of comparative politics at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. “What Putin is saying is that there is no such thing as Ukrainian nationhood — that Ukrainians and Russians are the same people. But for us, what it means to be Ukrainian isn’t about your ethnicity or your language.”</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, as the war on the country’s eastern border has dragged on, Ukrainian views toward NATO have gotten more positive, according to <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/olga.onuch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olga Onuch</a>, a political scientist at the University of Manchester who studies Ukraine. Survey data from Onuch and a group of colleagues shows that support for joining NATO has increased substantially, from around 30 percent in May 2014 to 55 percent in January 2021. <a href="https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/for_release_2021_november_survey_of_residents_of_ukraine_eng.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other surveys</a> show similar trends.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Ukrainians increasingly favor joining NATO" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Y7Vbg/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Asking about membership in NATO is a little complicated because as a former Soviet state, it’s not clear if Ukraine will ever be invited to join. Perspectives on the prospect are changing, though. Some Ukrainians who were on the fence — perhaps because they associated NATO with foreign influence thanks to its role in the Cold War, or worried that closer ties would provoke Russia — may be warming to the idea, Onuch told us. Those views have likely changed in part because of the war, she said, but also because Zelensky — <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20190416-russian-speakers-ukraine-candidate-talking-language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a native Russian speaker</a> from southern Ukraine, a part of the country with more Russian ties — has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59667938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone out of his way</a> to emphasize the need for cooperation with the west. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ukrainians aren’t sure, though, that the war is about to escalate. According to a recent KIIS poll, just under half (48 percent) of respondents <a href="https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=ukr&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=1091&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say they believe Russia will attack</a>, although <a href="https://dif.org.ua/article/yak-zminilasya-dumka-ukraintsiv-pro-rosiysko-ukrainsku-viynu-za-dva-roki-prezidenstva-zelenskogo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another poll conducted by the Razumkov Center, a Ukrainian think tank, found</a> that 71 percent of Ukrainians think the country is already in a war with Russia. In December, <a href="https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=ukr&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=1079&amp;page=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR3akv1dZbaMZmKbgFTAEEZXNsb0OsB82xdQ5z2cIsijLVoTVaDID5R1MeM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KIIS found that a sizable share of Ukrainians say</a> they’re either prepared to fight Russia (33 percent) or protest (22 percent) if the war starts — although, Brik pointed out, willingness to fight was much higher in the western part of the country, which is not where the violence has been concentrated so far.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in the U.S. the war in Ukraine is just coming back onto more Americans’ radar as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/biden-threatens-putin-with-personal-sanctions-if-russia-invades-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden threatened sanctions</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/biden-troops-europe/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put troops on alert</a> for possible deployment to eastern Europe. In general, Americans don’t have an especially friendly attitude toward Russia either. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/trackers/friend-enemy-russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to weekly YouGov surveys</a> that have been conducted since 2017, the share of Americans who see Russia as an enemy has increased from 60 percent to 75 percent. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/26/republicans-and-democrats-alike-view-russia-more-as-a-competitor-than-an-enemy-of-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pew Research Center poll conducted from Jan. 10-17</a> asked the question slightly differently, but it found that 49 percent of Americans see Russia as a competitor to the U.S. and 41 percent see Russia as an enemy. Only seven percent said Russia was a partner of the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that doesn’t necessarily mean Americans support military assistance to Ukraine. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2022/01/24/ba70a/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A YouGov poll</a> conducted on Jan. 24 found that Americans were divided on whether the U.S. has a responsibility to protect Ukraine: 35 percent said that it does, 33 percent said that it doesn’t and 33 percent were unsure. That’s perhaps not surprising, given that the Pew poll, which was conducted before NATO committed to sending military support, found that most Americans don’t see the Russian buildup near Ukraine as a sizable threat to U.S. interests: 26 percent said it was a major threat and 33 percent said it was a minor threat. Only seven percent said that it was no threat at all, though, and a significant chunk (33 percent) said they just didn’t know how Russia’s actions toward Ukraine affect U.S. interests.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As more Americans find out about the conflict, those views could change. Pew found that half (49 percent) of people who said they had heard a lot about the military buildup saw Russia’s actions as a threat to the U.S., compared to 26 percent of those who had heard a little, and nine percent of those who had heard nothing at all. At that point, only 23 percent of respondents had heard a lot about the military buildup, so there’s plenty of room for attitudes to shift. But it’s not exactly clear how that will happen. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/republicans-ukraine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some Republicans are attacking Biden</a> for not being aggressive enough against Russia, but other voices on the right — particularly Fox News’s Tucker Carlson — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/26/what-trumps-tucker-carlsons-rationalization-putin-means-ukraine-standoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been pushing the idea</a> that the U.S. shouldn’t get involved in the conflict with Ukraine. And that, of course, follows years of former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/03/politics/trump-putin-russia-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking glowingly about Putin</a>. <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-as-ukraine-tensions-escalate-62-percent-of-republicans-say-putin-is-a-stronger-leader-than-biden-192437439.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Yahoo News/YouGov poll conducted from Jan. 20-24</a> found that when asked to choose, 62 percent of Republicans — and 71 percent of cable news viewers who primarily watch Fox News — said they believe Putin is a stronger leader than Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Ukrainians, though, one thing is key — as the conflict moves forward, it’s their country’s sovereignty that’s at stake. “The conflict is always perceived in terms of the Cold War — it’s between the United States and Russia, and Ukraine is in the middle,” Brik said. “But a lot of Ukrainians don’t feel that’s how it is. They have their own identity, interests, and agency, and after seven years of war, they want to decide how things move forward.”</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Most Americans are now aware of the metaverse. Both <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-01/Data%20Tables%20to%20Accompany%20Release_1.pdf">Ipsos</a> and <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FLASH-011422_Protocol_Data.pdf">the Harris Poll</a> found that just 31 percent of Americans hadn’t heard of the term. But the metaverse remains abstract and confusing to Americans, and this could pose barriers to widespread use. According to the Harris Poll, 52 percent of Americans felt overwhelmed by the concept of the metaverse, and 60 percent didn’t understand its purpose.</li><li>Many Americans believe the lack of affordable housing is one of the greatest problems facing their community. In a recently published survey from Pew Research Center, 49 percent of Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/18/a-growing-share-of-americans-say-affordable-housing-is-a-major-problem-where-they-live/">called it “a major problem”</a> in their own community — up 10 percentage points from 2018. In fact, it surpassed other problems that people were concerned about, like drug addiction (35 percent), the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and health (34 percent and 26 percent, respectively) and crime (22 percent). Americans living in lower-income households (57 percent) were more likely to label this a major problem than Americans in middle- or upper-income households (47 percent and 42 percent, respectively), but the biggest differences were regional. Over two-thirds (69 percent) of those living in the West found lack of affordable housing to be a major problem — a much higher rate than among those living in the Northeast (49 percent), South (44 percent) or Midwest (33 percent).</li><li>Almost 50 years after the constitutional right to abortion was established in Roe v. Wade, abortion remains a polarizing issue. A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/majority-still-supports-roe-opposition-ticks-up-new-high">recent Fox News poll</a> found that only 31 percent of Americans wanted the Supreme Court to overturn Roe, in line with 30 percent from a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/politics/cnn-poll-abortion-roe-v-wade/index.html">recent CNN/SSRS poll</a>. Most Americans — 63 percent according to Fox News and 69 percent according to CNN/SSRS — didn’t want the court to overturn Roe. But the fact that a clear majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade obscures <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/">what the country is really divided about</a>: the specific circumstances under which abortion should be legal, such as the number of weeks of gestation at which the procedure can take place.</li><li>While President Biden’s favorability ratings have been declining, American’s view of his character is complicated. A majority of Americans still saw him as likable (60 percent) and intelligent (59 percent), according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389219/biden-seen-likable-smart-not-strong-leader-manager.aspx">a January poll from Gallup</a>. However, opinion of him as a leader has soured — particularly among independents and Democrats. From Sept. 2020 to Jan. 2022, the share of respondents who said Biden “can manage the government effectively” declined by 19 points among Democrats and 21 points among independents.</li><li>Americans widely support the Biden administration’s initiative to provide free masks and tests. More than four in five (84 percent) supported the government both mailing out free at-home COVID-19 tests and providing N95 masks through pharmacies and health clinics, according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">a recent poll from Axios/Ipsos</a>. One reason for this high support may be that Americans continue to face barriers to getting tested. Of the 21 percent who said they took a COVID-19 test within the last week, 24 percent reported trying and failing to buy an at-home test, 21 percent reported waiting in a long line and 18 percent reported being unable to get an appointment.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2022-midterm-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coverage of the 2022 midterm elections</a> has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to focus</a> on control of Congress — but control of state governments will be on the ballot too. In fact, with policymaking in Washington at a standstill, state-level elections may well have the bigger impact on Americans’ daily lives. And the biggest prize on the state level, of course, is the governor’s office. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though governors have always been important for their influence on health care, education, tax policy and more, the 2022 gubernatorial elections feel particularly urgent. Governors have the ability to block — or sign off on — election law changes and election-subversion efforts ahead of the 2024 presidential election, and they are also usually the ones making life-or-death decisions about COVID-19 policy in their states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A handful of governors were on the ballot in 2019, 2020 and 2021, but the bulk of the nation’s chief executives get elected in midterm years. As such, 36 states are hosting gubernatorial elections in 2022; Republicans are defending 20 seats, and Democrats are defending 16. However, even though Democrats flipped seven governorships in the 2018 midterms, this is likely to be a better cycle for Republicans: The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political winds are at their backs</a>, and Democrats are defending more governorships in red or purple states than Republicans are in blue or purple ones.</p>

 <p>*Based on race ratings from The Cook Political Report, Inside Elections and Sabato’s Crystal Ball.</p>
 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Not all of those 36 races will be competitive, but the playing field is certainly larger than it is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-7-senate-races-that-will-likely-decide-control-of-the-chamber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the Senate</a>. If you take the median rating of each gubernatorial race from the three major qualitative election handicappers (<a href="http://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cook Political Report</a>, <a href="http://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Elections</a> and <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2022-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a>), 16 races are something other than safely Democratic or safely Republican. Here’s a breakdown of those races into four different categories based on what color turf they are being fought on.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Defending enemy territory</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three of the first four lines in the table above are the three deep-blue states with Republican governors — living proof that strong gubernatorial candidates can <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/odds-are-your-next-governor-will-be-a-democrat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overcome their state’s partisanship</a> to a degree congressional candidates can only dream of. But the band is breaking up: Popular Govs. Charlie Baker and Larry Hogan are retiring, giving Democrats an excellent chance to flip their seats. (The final member of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-the-popularity-above-replacement-governor-rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maroon Three</a>, Republican Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, is <a href="https://www.addisonindependent.com/2021/11/18/eric-davis-sizing-up-the-races-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to run for reelection and should be safe.) As a result, Massachusetts and Maryland are probably the two likeliest governor’s offices to change parties in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Massachusetts</strong>, Baker’s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/07/metro/baker-blasts-trump-after-wednesdays-violent-siege-us-capitol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repudiation of former President Donald Trump</a> has kept him in the <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2021/12/13/charlie-baker-democrat-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good graces</a> of the state’s many Democrats, but Republicans don’t appear interested in following that formula for his successor: The GOP front-runner is <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/10/05/metro/donald-trump-endorses-republican-geoff-diehl-massachusetts-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-endorsed</a> former state Rep. Geoff Diehl. By contrast, Democrats have a heavyweight candidate in <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/01/19/attorney-general-healey-announces-gubernatoril-run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state Attorney General Maura Healey</a>, who could be the nation’s first openly lesbian governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Maryland</strong>, the primaries are more competitive, but the outcome still likely won’t change the fact that Democrats are favored in the fall. Notable Democratic candidates include state Comptroller Peter Franchot, former Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez, former Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker and nonprofit executive Wes Moore. On the Republican side, Trump <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-trump-cox-20211123-t2x7vcaty5f6vjg2fseaxkanlu-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has endorsed</a> state Del. Dan Cox, who bused Trump supporters to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Hogan, however, has called Cox “a QAnon whack job” and endorsed state Secretary of Commerce Kelly Schulz. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Massachusetts and Maryland’s mirror image is <strong>Kansas</strong>, a deep-red state that nevertheless has a Democratic chief executive, Gov. Laura Kelly. Kelly, though, is running for reelection, which has led handicappers to dub Kansas a toss-up rather than an easy Republican pick-up. As of the third quarter of 2021, a healthy <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/18/phil-scott-approval-vermont-polling-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent of Kansans</a> approved of Kelly’s job performance, but she’ll face a formidable Republican opponent in state Attorney General Derek Schmidt, Kansas’s highest-profile state-level Republican officeholder.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Toss-ups in a toss-up land</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Partisanship may not be the be-all-and-end-all of governor’s races, but it <em>has</em> been growing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more and more important</a> in recent gubernatorial elections. It’s no surprise, then, that the other gubernatorial toss-up states are the usual suspects: the same six states that have topped the list of swing states in past presidential elections, too. In <a href="https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2022/01/2022-January-Statewide-MEDIA-FREQUENCY.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two</a> recent <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/politics/2022/01/11/poll-michigan-gov-whitmers-job-approval-trends-up-as-2022-election-looms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> of <strong>Michigan</strong>, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer led her likely Republican opponent, former Detroit police chief James Craig, by margins of 5-10 percentage points, but she didn’t crack 50 percent in either poll, suggesting that the race will tighten as voters get to know Craig. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers must contend with not only President Biden’s unpopularity in the state, but also <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/11/03/joe-biden-tony-evers-ron-johnson-approval-ratings-dip-marquette-university-law-school-poll/6265242001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his own mediocre approval ratings</a> (45 percent last October). Former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch is the Republican front-runner here, but <a href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/political/elections-local/politicos-waiting-to-see-if-kevin-nicholson-will-jump-into-wisconsins-governor-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">businessman Kevin Nicholson</a> and <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/at-80-tommy-thompson-wont-rule-out-another-run-for-wisconsin-governor/article_bf79381f-c63d-5355-95aa-ceea341bbd0a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Gov. Tommy Thompson</a> may yet still decide to run. Ominously for Democrats, Michigan and Wisconsin’s gubernatorial races have both historically gone with the midterm flow: Republicans won them in 2010 and 2014, Democrats in 2006 and 2018. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Nevada</strong>, former Sen. Dean Heller is the big name in the crowded Republican primary to take on Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, but he hasn’t exactly jumped out to a dominant lead: Heller <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sisolak-raises-record-4-5-million-in-2021-has-more-cash-than-all-gop-foes-combined?link_id=75&amp;can_id=5f27a3767bd4756f5c4ec89f31b71bbe&amp;source=email-morning-digest-republican-launches-rematch-for-governor-in-connecticut-after-close-2018-race&amp;email_referrer=email_1415548&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-republican-launches-rematch-for-governor-in-connecticut-after-close-2018-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised just $650,000</a> in 2021, while Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo raised $3.1 million and North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee raised $1.6 million. (Sisolak, for his part, raised $4.5 million.) The <a href="https://twitter.com/RalstonReports/status/1470912722078289920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent general-election poll</a>, conducted by Democratic pollster ALG Research, showed both Sisolak-Heller and Sisolak-Lombardo within the margin of error.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>, term limits are barring Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf from running again, but Democrats have a strong candidate in state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who was Pennsylvania’s best-performing statewide Democrat in 2020. Thanks in part to a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/josh-shapiro-fundraising-campaign-pennsylvania-governor-20211020.html#loaded" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10 million campaign war chest</a>, Shapiro has managed the nearly unprecedented feat of <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/josh-shapiro-democratic-nomination-pennsylvania-governor-20211011.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clearing the Democratic primary field</a>. The Republican primary, meanwhile, is a total free-for-all. Former Rep. Lou Barletta has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2018/02/11/Donald-Trump-endorses-Pennsylvania-Republican-Rep-Lou-Barletta/stories/201802110178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a history with Trump</a> (though the former president hasn’t endorsed in this race yet); state Senate President Jake Corman has <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/politics/corman-top-republican-in-pa-senate-says-he-has-3-million-for-governors-race/article_b41865ae-7548-11ec-bc20-4fc8bf5ad09d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 million in the bank</a>; former U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain has the support of a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/01/20/Pa-governor-s-race-A-Republican-group-with-20-million-is-backing-Bill-McSwain/stories/202201200131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 million PAC</a>; and almost a dozen other candidates have designs on the governor’s mansion too. The nightmare candidate for Democrats (and Republicans who care about electability) would be state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who <a href="https://www.witf.org/2021/05/28/pa-sen-doug-mastriano-unlikely-to-face-consequences-over-newly-released-jan-6-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection</a> and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/doug-mastriano-pennsylvania-election-20201205.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plotted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results</a> in Pennsylvania.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have a couple opportunities to play offense in this category too. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey of <strong>Arizona</strong> is term-limited out this year, leaving an unsettled GOP field in his wake. Trump has <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/09/28/donald-trump-endorses-kari-lake-arizona-governor/5837690001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> former TV news anchor Kari Lake, who says she <a href="https://www.insider.com/arizona-governor-candidate-kari-lake-not-certified-2020-election-results-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn’t have certified</a> Biden’s 2020 victory in Arizona and has called for the <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyduda/status/1444484819312787459?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imprisonment</a> of Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. However, the tea party wing of the party (think <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ted-cruz-endorses-matt-salmon-arizona-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Ted Cruz</a> and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-rep-matt-salmon-enters-arizona-gubernatorial-race-with-top-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Club for Growth</a>) is behind former Rep. Matt Salmon, and “undecided” leads <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/state-of-arizona-governor-and-senate-primaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary polls</a> by a wide margin. Meanwhile, Democrats again have a strong single front-runner: in this case, Hobbs herself.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, both the primary and general election for governor of <strong>Georgia</strong> are going to be among the most closely watched in the country. Furious at Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/why-kemp-wont-call-an-illegal-special-session-to-overturn-georgias-election/6L6KT2NZEZCU7MYXADEBLIO6S4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certification of Biden’s 2020 win</a> in the Peach State, Trump turned on his one-time ally and <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/12/05/former-gop-sen-david-perdue-will-challenge-brian-kemp-in-georgia-governor-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruited former Sen. David Perdue</a> to primary him. <a href="https://insideradvantage.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GEORGIA-INSIDERADVANTAGE_FOX5ATLANTA-poll-All-3Qs-.xls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls</a> show Kemp leading Perdue and a handful of minor candidates, but not always by enough to avoid a runoff, which could consolidate the anti-Kemp vote around Perdue. Regardless of who wins, the Republican nominee will likely take high unfavorable ratings (the primary has already <a href="https://www.news-daily.com/news/georgia-gov-brian-kemp-launches-anti-perdue-campaign-ad/article_35d9db8e-5060-5a8f-9ba6-3e94b68618ec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned negative</a>) and a depleted bank account into a difficult general-election campaign against former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams. As Democrats’ 2018 nominee for this office, Abrams already has a vaunted <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/how-georgia-got-organized-stacey-abrams-democrats-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">field</a> and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/12/stacey-abrams-declares-run-for-georgia-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising</a> operation in place and so far faces no primary opposition. If she wins, she’d be the <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/theres-been-zero-black-female-governors-in-us-history-2022-may-change-that-015304588.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Black female governor</a> in U.S. history.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Break glass in case of red wave</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then there are at least four light-blue states where Democrats are favored to hold the governor’s office — but the party shouldn’t take them for granted. Though these states have rarely been competitive over the last three election cycles, we also haven’t experienced a Republican wave election in that span — and they <em>were</em> competitive during the GOP’s strong 2014 and 2010. If the national political environment in 2022 trends that favorably for Republicans, don’t be surprised to see these governorships get swept away in the red wave.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The list likely starts with <strong>Maine</strong>, where Republican former Gov. Paul LePage is looking to unseat Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. First elected in 2010 and reelected in 2014, LePage was the nation’s Trumpiest governor before “Trumpy” even made sense as a political description, routinely making headlines for <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2016/08/27/politics/lepages-latest-firestorm-is-more-damaging-than-previous-controversies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist comments</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ZachBlanchard/status/1006546814693249024?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejection of valid election results</a>. Another red wave in 2022 could return him to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blaine_House" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blaine House</a>, especially considering that Maine does not use ranked-choice voting in gubernatorial elections the way it does for federal office.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>New Mexico</strong> also elected a Republican governor in 2010 and 2014, and Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham could have trouble securing a second term. New Mexicans are <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2021/08/23/poll-lujan-grisham-at-46-approval-45-disapproval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divided</a> on her job performance, and she recently <a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/former-campaign-staffer-who-accused-lujan-grisham-of-abuse-receives-settlement/article_f6fc33fe-9c64-11eb-b5ae-67e21f6644a6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settled a lawsuit</a> accusing her of sexual harassment. Working in her favor, though, is the fact that she faces an undistinguished Republican primary field: The biggest name is probably TV meteorologist Mark Ronchetti, who lost the state’s 2020 U.S. Senate race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans also lack a top-tier candidate in <strong>Minnesota</strong>, where the gubernatorial hopefuls include former state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, state Sen. Michelle Benson and former Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek. In a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21150757/kstp-surveyusa-poll-governors-race-120721.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December poll</a>, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz led all five candidates he was tested against by at least 11 points, but he also took a consistent 47-48 percent in each matchup, so these numbers may tighten once Republicans settle on and get to know their nominee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans might even have a shot at their <a href="https://kval.com/news/local/oregon-hasnt-elected-a-republican-governor-since-vic-atiyeh-won-re-election-in-1982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white whale</a> — the <strong>Oregon</strong> governor’s office, which they lost by just 6 points in 2014 and 2 points in 2010. Although Democratic Gov. Kate Brown is not eligible to run for reelection, her <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2021/11/18/polling-shows-kate-brown-is-least-popular-governor-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowest-in-the-nation approval rating</a> (according to Morning Consult last year) could weigh down the Democrats trying to succeed her. State Treasurer Tobias Read and former state House Speaker Tina Kotek (who could <em>also</em> be the nation’s first openly lesbian governor) headline a crowded Democratic field, while former state House Minority Leader Christine Drazan and 2016 nominee Bud Pierce are among the Republicans in contention.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if the red tide rises high enough, even bluer states could be at risk of electing a Republican governor. States like Colorado, Connecticut and Illinois hosted close gubernatorial campaigns in 2010 and 2014, and while two out of the three election handicapping sites rate those state as “solid Democratic” for 2022, Sabato’s Crystal Ball lists them as only “likely Democratic,” acknowledging the possibility for them to get competitive.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Dare to dream, Democrats?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midterm dynamics</a> suggest that 2022 is likelier to see Republicans making inroads into blue states than Democrats making inroads into red ones, but, since gubernatorial elections can sometimes break the mold, it’s also worth keeping an eye on a few light-red states. The incumbent Republican governors in the following three states are certainly favored, but we can’t rule out a Democratic upset.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Their best shot is probably in <strong>Florida</strong>, which always seems to host a competitive election no matter if the year is good for Republicans or Democrats. (The 2010 gubernatorial election was decided by 1.1 points, 2014 by 1.1 points and 2018 by 0.4 points.) Gov. Ron DeSantis, who adopted a hands-off attitude toward the coronavirus, was one of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-like-how-their-governor-is-handling-the-coronavirus-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few governors</a> to see his approval rating <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/455438-ron-desantis-net-approval-falls-14-points-among-florida-voters-as-covid-19-cases-soar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decrease amid the pandemic</a>, and three Democrats hope to be the one to end his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/ron-desantis-speech-potential-2024-candidate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political ambitions</a>: Rep. Charlie Crist started the campaign as the <a href="http://stpetepolls.org/files/StPetePolls_2021_State_DEM_May26_NC7H3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary front-runner</a>, but state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried has gained ground in <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/449843-poll-shows-nikki-fried-leading-charlie-crist-in-democratic-primary-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more recent polls</a>, and state Sen. Annette Taddeo has racked up some <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/483386-we-must-reverse-course-daniella-levine-cava-endorses-annette-taddeo-for-florida-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major</a> <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/471890-embodiment-of-the-american-dream-donna-shalala-endorses-annette-taddeo-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a> as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other two states would probably require a primary upset in order to get truly suspenseful. In <strong>Ohio</strong>, Gov. Mike DeWine is facing a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/25/trump-ohio-governorship-00001603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spirited primary challenge</a> from former Rep. Jim Renacci. Though Trump hasn’t weighed in on the race, he has <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/11/trump-takes-shot-at-ohio-gov-mike-dewine-says-in-tweet-his-upcoming-race-will-be-hotly-contested.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued veiled threats</a> against DeWine, and Renacci is running a Trumpy campaign animated by DeWine’s support for coronavirus restrictions. At the same time, a pair of mayors — Nan Whaley of Dayton and John Cranley of Cincinnati — are facing off in the Democratic primary, no doubt hoping that the far-right Renacci could prove easier to topple than the popular (<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/18/phil-scott-approval-vermont-polling-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">62 percent approval rating</a> in the third quarter of 2021) DeWine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, Democrats have a celebrity candidate for governor of <strong>Texas</strong> (though <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/28/matthew-mcconaughey-texas-governor-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not the one many thought</a>): former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who proved his mettle as a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/12/07/Beto-ORourke-80-million-raised/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prodigious fundraiser</a> with his voguish 2018 Senate campaign. O’Rourke <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2022/01/18/beto-orourke-raises-72m-in-first-46-days-of-his-campaign-for-texas-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $7.2 million</a> in the first 46 days of his gubernatorial campaign, which certainly sounds impressive … until you consider that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott had $65 million cash on hand at the end of 2021. Abbott has also led most <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general-election polls</a> (though some have been within the <a href="https://redfieldandwiltonstrategies.com/magnified-email/issue-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">margin of error</a>), suggesting that Democrats’ best shot may be if Abbott loses the upcoming March 1 primary. Former Texas GOP chair Allen West and former state Sen. Don Huffines are challenging Abbott from the right, but <a href="https://www.uttyler.edu/politicalscience/files/dmn-uttylernov2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent polls</a> have given Abbott a wide lead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Jan. 28, 2022, 1:43 p.m.):</strong> An earlier version of this article said that there are at least four light-red states where Democrats are favored to hold the governor’s office.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">With Wednesday’s news that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire/story?id=74363429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Stephen Breyer will retire from the Supreme Court</a> at the end of its current term, Democrats have avoided their worst-case scenario for the nation’s highest court: that Republicans would take control of the Senate before Breyer retired, allowing Sen. Mitch McConnell to keep Breyer’s seat open to eventually replace the liberal justice with a more conservative one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that fear has now been replaced by a different one. Although Democrats currently enjoy control of the Senate, it is by the narrowest of margins: 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote. And two members of the Democratic caucus, moderate Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have already torpedoed several major Democratic priorities, including <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-failed-voting-rights-push-is-a-setback-for-democracy-and-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting-rights legislation</a> and the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/manchin-bidens-build-back-social-spending-plan/story?id=81843089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Build Back Better Act</a>. Could Manchin and Sinema delay — or even block — the confirmation of Breyer’s replacement too?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Based on past judicial confirmation votes, it’s unlikely. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Senate has been remarkably efficient at passing President Biden’s judicial nominees so far: During the first year of his presidency, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/01/26/bidens-first-year-judicial-appointments-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42 of Biden’s district-court and appeals-court nominees</a> have been confirmed — more than any president since John F. Kennedy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And crucially, Democrats have been united behind those nominees. The next time a Democratic senator votes no on one of Biden’s judicial picks, it will be the first time. That means that even Manchin and Sinema have 100 percent track records of supporting Biden’s judicial nominees.</p>

<p>Excludes votes a senator skipped.</p>
<p>Source: U.S. Senate</p>
</footer>
</section>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, there are limitations to this kind of analysis. First, Democratic senators <em>have</em> occasionally skipped confirmation votes, which could be a convenient way to avoid casting a “no” vote. (And both Manchin and Sinema have skipped an above-average number of votes: seven for Manchin, 12 for Sinema.) We also don’t know if there are any confirmation votes Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer declined to hold because he knew the nominee didn’t have the votes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the very least, Manchin, Sinema and every other Senate Democrat have been reticent to publicly express opposition to one of Biden’s nominees — and with a position as important as the Supreme Court, the pressure to toe the party line will likely be even greater.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If anything, the data shows it’s more likely that a Republican might break ranks to vote <em>for</em> Biden’s Supreme Court nominee than that a Democrat would vote against her. Three Republicans have voted for a majority of Biden’s judicial nominees thus far: Sen. Susan Collins (36 out of 42), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (33 out of 39, with three missed votes) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (26 out of 31, with 11 missed votes).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Collins and Murkowski are well known as two of the most moderate members of the Republican caucus, and Graham is a throwback to an earlier era when the Senate deferred to the president on his appointees. “Senator Graham has long believed that under the Constitution the president has the right to select judges of their choosing and as long as they are qualified, they should generally be confirmed by the Senate,” Graham’s office <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/583111-graham-emerges-as-go-to-ally-for-bidens-judicial-picks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a statement</a> last year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the same intraparty pressures that could keep Manchin and Sinema in line for a Supreme Court nominee would also apply to Collins, Murkowski and Graham, so Biden shouldn’t count on their votes. (In particular, Murkowski is up for reelection this year and faces a formidable Republican primary challenge, so she may not be inclined to anger Republicans further with a pro-Biden vote.) But if Biden is looking for bipartisan support for his nominee, he’s most likely to find it among these three senators.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer is planning to retire at the end of the court’s current term, clearing the way for President Biden to appoint a new justice. Biden said during a 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate in South Carolina that if elected, he would nominate a Black woman to the nation’s highest court, and media speculation is heavily focused now on D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-eyed-potential-replacement-justice/story?id=82490731" data-type="URL" data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-eyed-potential-replacement-justice/story?id=82490731" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this emergency installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses how the Supreme Court may change after the retirement of Breyer, a more moderate justice among the court’s liberal wing. They also consider whether the ensuing confirmation process will affect the country’s broader political environment in a midterm election year.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer announced that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire/story?id=74363429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he will retire from the court</a> at the end of this year’s term, setting up Democrats to nominate and confirm his successor later this year — in other words, in the months leading up to the 2022 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Breyer’s retirement was widely expected, given his age and the Democrats’ precarious hold on the Senate. If anything, the bigger surprise was that the 83-year-old liberal justice, who was <a href="https://www.oyez.org/justices/stephen_g_breyer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated to the court</a> by President Bill Clinton in 1994, waited this long to relinquish his seat. Plenty of Democratic-appointed judges <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/politics/judges-biden-democrats-trump/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handed in their retirement letters</a> as soon as it became clear that a Democratic president could replace them (Republican-appointed judges have done this with Republican presidents, too), but Breyer decided to hold on for another year — probably out of a desire to weigh in on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-right-turn-goes-way-beyond-guns-and-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the stunning array</a> of high-profile issues that the court is considering this term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From a political perspective, Breyer’s retirement is nowhere near as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-conservative-is-brett-kavanaugh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consequential</a> as other <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/obama-wont-be-able-to-replace-scalia-with-a-justice-as-liberal-as-sotomayor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-ruth-bader-ginsburgs-death-could-mean-for-2020-and-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacancies</a>. Assuming the Democratic majority in the Senate coalesces around Biden’s nominee, Breyer will in all likelihood be replaced by another liberal, leaving the ideological balance of the court the same as it is now. But Breyer’s departure is still significant for the ways in which it will change the court. For one thing, his judicial approach — which <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/01/stephen-breyer-pragmatic-liberal-will-retire-at-end-of-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasized pragmatism and compromise</a> — is going out of vogue in an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-made-the-federal-courts-whiter-and-more-conservative-and-that-will-be-tough-for-biden-to-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly polarized judiciary</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">His replacement will likely make history, too. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/biden-long-preparing-supreme-court-pick-82489264" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden has promised to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court</a>, and now could be his best opportunity to make good on that pledge. Having more diversity on the high court won’t necessarily change outcomes in hot-button cases, especially given <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the overall conservative bent of the court</a>, but it could add more complexity to the court’s decision-making on issues like affirmative action, which the justices just <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-takes-cases-future-affirmative-action/story?id=78255962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to consider in a new set of cases</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Breyer’s pragmatic approach is increasingly rare</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Throughout his tenure on the Supreme Court, Breyer has been a reliable member of the liberal coalition. According to the Martin-Quinn scores, a commonly used measure of judicial ideology, Breyer has been a very consistent center-left justice — in recent years, his score was almost indistinguishable from Justice Elena Kagan, another moderate liberal.</p>

That pragmatic streak was on display in 2005, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/world/americas/ten-commandments-split-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when he served as the pivotal vote</a> in two separate cases about public displays of the Ten Commandments. In one of the cases, he voted with the conservatives to uphold the display; in the other, he voted with the liberals to strike it down. Over the years, he joined the conservatives in a variety of other important religion cases, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/maryland-peace-cross-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dispute over a 40-foot cross</a> that was displayed on public property in Maryland and a fight over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-playgrounds-church-and-state-missouri.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether Missouri could exclude</a> a church from a public grant program for playground resurfacing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In those cases, he often stressed the need to avoid religious disagreements — which sometimes led to outcomes that upset liberals. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/justices-allow-a-commandments-display-bar-others.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the 2005 case where he voted</a> to uphold a Ten Commandments display in Texas, for instance, he wrote that although it was a “borderline case,” ruling that it was unconstitutional could lead to the removal of similar displays around the country and “thereby create the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And his breaks with his liberal colleagues haven’t been on religion alone. According to <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60188505fb790b33c3d33a61/t/61f1855081fb31470cda3c37/1643218256396/ReplacingJusticeBreyer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent analysis</a> by political scientists Lee Epstein, Andrew Martin and Kevin Quinn, Breyer cast the lowest percentage of liberal votes of any of the three Democratic appointees who served with him. Epstein, Martin and Quinn found that most of those disagreements were in the area of criminal procedure, particularly in cases related to search and seizure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Breyer has been an outspoken liberal voice on other issues, including reproductive rights and the death penalty. In 2016, he wrote the majority opinion in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, a case where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the justices struck down several provisions</a> of a Texas abortion law and reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion. And he’s authored plenty of high-profile dissents too. According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-conservative-6-3-majority-would-reshape-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an analysis we conducted when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in 2020</a>, he had the third-highest dissent rate of any justice since 1953, coming in just behind Ginsburg and Justice Thurgood Marshall. One of his most famous recent dissents was in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/us/supreme-court-execution-drug.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2015 case involving a challenge to a specific execution drug</a>, where he called on the justices to reconsider the constitutionality of the death penalty itself.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But Breyer plainly became concerned about the court’s reputation, particularly after Ginsburg died and was replaced by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-conservative-6-3-majority-would-reshape-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave the conservative majority even more power</a>. He’s spent the years since then trying to convince Americans that the court was fundamentally a nonideological institution, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/justice-breyers-rosy-view-of-an-apolitical-supreme-court/2021/09/16/948482b8-012b-11ec-ba7e-2cf966e88e93_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even publishing a short book</a> where he argued that the court — despite its clear conservative tilt — was not a political institution. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That commitment to preserving the judiciary’s nonpartisan image — and staying mostly in line with public opinion — put Breyer increasingly out of step with the court’s trajectory. This year’s term isn’t over yet, but at least some of the Supreme Court conservatives <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-abortion-law-is-unprecedented-but-the-supreme-court-isnt-treating-it-that-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seem ready to veer</a> sharply outside the mainstream on abortion, gun rights and other high-profile issues. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/us/politics/texas-abortion-law-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows no desire</a> to make nice with the conservatives — in a recent dissent, she called the court’s decision to leave a highly restrictive Texas abortion law in place a “disaster” and a “grave disservice to women in Texas.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a 2020 interview, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/stephen-breyer-interview-dahlia-lithwick-80-over-80.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breyer told reporter Dahlia Lithwick</a>, “The best is the enemy of the good. … But if you have a choice between achieving 20 or 30 percent of what you’d like or being the hero of all your friends, choose the first.” That attitude seems unlikely to be especially popular at the Supreme Court going forward — among liberals or conservatives.</p>



<h2><strong>His replacement will likely make the court more diverse</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the 2020 campaign trail, Biden promised that if he had the opportunity to name a justice to the Supreme Court, he would nominate a Black woman. Now with Breyer’s retirement, he has his chance. It would be a historic appointment. A Black woman has never served on the Supreme Court. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the court’s history, there have been only five female justices, and only one (Sotomayor) has been a woman of color; meanwhile, there have been only two Black justices, both male. Black women are also heavily underrepresented in the federal judiciary as a whole. Only 5 percent of active federal court judges are Black women, and on the powerful courts of appeals, there are only six Black female judges. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This means that Biden has few options to choose from — at least, if he wants to nominate someone who’s already served as a judge. One <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading possibility</a> is Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was named to the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit early in Biden’s presidency. Other possibilities include California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, U.S. District Judge J. Michelle Childs — who was also recently tapped for the D.C. Circuit but has yet to be confirmed — and U.S. District Judge Leslie Abrams Gardner, who is the sister of Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden has already done a lot to shift the number of Black women in the courts, too. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-is-reshaping-the-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As Elena Mejía and I wrote in December</a>, he’s already coming through on his pledge to diversify the judiciary in a big way. According to our analysis, the vast majority of the people who have been confirmed under his presidency are women or people of color. So there’s no reason to expect that he won’t follow through on his promise to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court, especially since <a href="https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1486427643599749120?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his press secretary said on Wednesday</a> that he “certainly” stands by his commitment. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, on such an ideologically divided court, there are probably limits on this kind of influence. But it’s noteworthy, too, that if Biden replaces Breyer with a Black woman, the liberal minority will be entirely composed of women, including two women of color. The question, of course, is what kind of judicial philosophy Breyer’s replacement will pursue — and how she will navigate an increasingly polarized court.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Senate Democrats have spent the past few months wrestling with President Biden’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-like-whats-in-the-build-back-better-act-theyre-lukewarm-on-the-bill-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social spending plan</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-failed-voting-rights-push-is-a-setback-for-democracy-and-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting rights legislation</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-cant-do-as-long-as-the-filibuster-remains-in-place-and-what-they-can/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the future of the filibuster</a>. But now that 2022 has begun, they must now contend with the prospect of defending their exceedingly narrow majority in Congress’s upper chamber. Democrats control the bare minimum of 50 seats, along with Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote, meaning Republicans need a net gain of just <em>one</em> seat to take control.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Democrats may actually have a better chance of retaining control of the Senate than they do the House, as the president’s party isn’t as susceptible to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a midterm penalty in the Senate</a> as it is in the House. That’s in part because only about one-third of the Senate is up each cycle, and the competitiveness of the seats up for election can vary a lot. To this point, Democrats could actually stand to benefit in 2022 because they don’t have to defend any seats in states former President Trump carried in 2020, while Republicans must protect two seats where Biden won — Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, thanks to how <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the electoral environment is shaping up</a> and the low threshold Republicans need to surpass in order to regain a Senate majority, things are still looking pretty good for the GOP. In total, there are 34 seats up this November, but based on the median race rating from election handicappers at <a href="https://insideelections.com/ratings/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Elections</a>, <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2022-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a> and <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cook Political Report</a>, there are just nine seats at this point that aren’t classified as safe for one party. And it’s the seven seats in this category that are currently marked as toss-ups or leaning toward one party that will likely decide the fate of the Senate in 2022.</p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with two of the most competitive Senate seats Democrats will have to defend in 2022: Arizona and Georgia. In 2020, these two Sun Belt states helped give Democrats their razor-thin majority, but now that region could hand Republicans control. Not only do two Democratic winners from last cycle have to defend seats they won in special elections — Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia — but Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada is also up in a state that <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=32&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden carried</a> by only slightly more than 2 percentage points in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Arizona, Kelly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/07/politics/mark-kelly-9-million-fourth-quarter-arizona/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has built a massive campaign warchest</a> of $18.5 million, but that’s no guarantee he’ll defeat whomever the GOP nominates in its competitive Aug. 2 primary. Republicans haven’t yet consolidated around a candidate, but there are three notables especially worth watching at this point: state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, Thiel Foundation president Blake Masters and solar energy executive Jim Lamon.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brnovich could maybe be described as a bit of a front-runner, <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/state-of-arizona-governor-and-senate-primaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having led in a few early polls</a>, but <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/7453540/AZPOP/210907_AZPOP/Arizona%20Public%20Opinion%20Pulse%20(AZPOP)%20Senate%20Toplines%20and%20Selected%20Crosstabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with support only in the high 20s</a> his lead isn’t insurmountable, especially since he’s trying to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-arizona-republican-senate-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk a fine line</a> of not angering Trump or <a href="https://ktar.com/story/4696915/arizona-ag-mark-brnovich-to-take-all-necessary-actions-on-election-findings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the party’s base</a> over his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/10/arizona-attorney-general-mark-brnovich-493245" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defense of Arizona’s 2020 election results</a>. Meanwhile, Masters is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/21/crypto-bros-ufos-nfts-thiel-527536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed by $10 million</a> in super PAC money from tech billionaire Peter Thiel and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/589844-trump-to-make-election-claims-center-stage-in-arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is on the attack</a>, blasting Brnovich for not sufficiently defending Trump’s false election claims, while Lamon has self-funded <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/11/03/the-top-10-senate-self-funders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least $5 million so far</a> and has played to the base <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/589706-gop-candidate-says-campaign-ad-was-rejected-over-lets-go-brandon?rl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by running a digital ad</a> in which he uses the euphemistic “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/lets-go-brandon-what-does-it-mean-republicans-joe-biden-ab13db212067928455a3dba07756a160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Go Brandon</a>” cheer to voice his disdain for Biden. Two other notable GOP candidates worth keeping an eye on are former Arizona National Guard head Mick McGuire and state Corporation Commissioner Justin Olson. It’s, of course, worth monitoring whether Gov. Doug Ducey jumps in, but that seems unlikely at this point, as he <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/blog/ducey-im-still-not-running-for-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated last week</a> that he doesn’t plan to run for Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The likely general election matchup is a bit clearer in Georgia, where Warnock will probably face Republican Herschel Walker, a <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/georgia-bulldogs/herschel-walker-reacts-to-georgias-national-championship#:~:text=Walker%2C%2059%2C%20went%20on%20to,time%2C%20consensus%20All-American." target="_blank" rel="noopener">hometown hero</a> who won a national championship and the Heisman Trophy as the country’s best college football player at the University of Georgia in the early 1980s. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/donald-trump-herschel-walker-endorsement-georgia-senate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump has already endorsed Walker</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/25/senate-gop-rallies-herschel-walker-517048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much of the GOP establishment</a> has rallied to him, too, despite the fact <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/residency-factors-into-walkers-senate-decision/85-33ec1212-59e4-4311-9096-5a88086f9260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s lived in Texas for many years</a>. Walker has also been candid in the past about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health issues</a>, but there are a number of troubling episodes that could mire his Senate bid, including allegations of violence against women. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, in Nevada, Cortez Masto’s likeliest Republican opponent is probably former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who also <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/donald-trump-endorses-ex-nevada-ag-adam-laxalt-for-senate-2424479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has Trump’s backing</a> after supporting Trump’s false election claims in 2020 as co-chair of the former president’s Nevada campaign. But Laxalt may not have smooth sailing in the June 14 primary thanks to Army veteran Sam Brown, <a href="https://mynews4.com/news/local/wounded-warrior-pageant-winner-enter-republican-primary-for-nevada-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whose moving story</a> as a roadside bomb victim while serving in Afghanistan has attracted a lot of attention, as well as <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/brown-raises-another-1-million-in-underdog-bid-against-laxalt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a couple million dollars in fundraising</a> over the past two quarters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just the Sun Belt that poses risks for Democrats, though. They may also struggle to defend Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan’s seat in New Hampshire. Hassan did catch a break in November, when popular New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/11/09/gov-chris-sununu-not-running-for-new-hampshire-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced he wouldn’t run against her</a>. But while Hassan led many of her <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/chuck-morse-run-u-senate-234900105.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential Republican opponents</a> in <a href="https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/sacsc-nhsw-0122-2-1642631595.pdf#page=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent general election polling</a>, she’s not out of the woods because New Hampshire has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the swingiest electorates</a> in the country. Beyond New Hampshire, it’s not hard to imagine Colorado’s blue-leaning seat, held by Sen. Michael Bennet, also becoming competitive if things deteriorate further for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turning to Republican-held seats that will be competitive in 2022 and perhaps even provide pickup opportunities for Democrats, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, where Sens. Pat Toomey and Richard Burr are retiring, may be particularly close. Wisconsin, where embattled Sen. Ron Johnson is seeking a third term, is also likely to be competitive. Biden won Pennsylvania and Wisconsin while narrowly losing North Carolina, but such results may not be enough for Democrats this cycle because all three lean somewhat to the right, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> That’s important because history suggests that it would be unusual for the GOP, as the opposition party, to lose seats that lean their way in a midterm. CNN’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/ron-johnson-republicans-senate-2022-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry Enten recently noted</a> that opposition-party incumbents in seats that leaned their party’s way (or away from the president’s party) had won 86 of 87 races in midterms since 1982. Pennsylvania and North Carolina are open-seat races, meaning there will be no GOP incumbent advantage, but even still, Enten found that the opposition party had won 32 of 35 such open seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevertheless, these races will be highly competitive — perhaps none more so than Pennsylvania, where both parties will have crowded primaries on May 17. The Republican race has been thrown wide open, too, with former Army Ranger and Trump-endorsed Sean Parnell <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/22/parnell-to-suspend-pennsylvania-senate-campaign-523195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping out amid scandal</a> in November, creating openings for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/30/dr-oz-announces-senate-bid-523530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">television personality and surgeon Mehmet Öz</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/13/politics/david-mccormick-us-senate-pennsylvania/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hedge fund executive David McCormick</a> to join a field that already included businessman Jeff Bartos, conservative commentator Kathy Barnette and former U.S. Ambassador Carla Sands. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the key questions in the Republican primary moving forward, though, will be who Trump decides to endorse, and as such, many are trying to prove their Trump bonafides.

No candidate has a particular fundraising edge either, given McCormick, Öz and Sands are all personally wealthy and can self-fund a substantial portion of their campaigns. That said, all three <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/clout/mehmet-oz-david-mccormick-carla-sands-carpetbaggers-senate-republicans-pennsylvania-20220114.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be vulnerable to “carpetbagging” claims</a>: Until recently, McCormick lived <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/pennsylvania-senate-race-republican-primary-david-mccormick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Connecticut</a>, Öz hailed from <a href="https://people.com/home/inside-the-new-jersey-mansion-dr-oz-and-his-wife-lisa-built-from-scratch-20-years-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey</a> and Sands <a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/ex-ambassador-investment-ceo-carla-sands-seeks-pennsylvania-senate-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was a California resident</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile on the Democratic side of the Pennsylvania race, the four highest-profile candidates come in pairs from the state’s two major metropolitan areas — Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. At this point, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a progressive from the Pittsburgh area, looks to have the early edge <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/PA/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in fundraising</a> and in pretty much all public polling of the race. But Rep. Conor Lamb, who represents a district west of Pittsburgh, is hoping to come off as the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/01/18/Conor-Lamb-gets-a-big-boost-from-the-east-as-Philly-Mayor-Jim-Kenney-supports-U-S-Senate-bid/stories/202201180102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most electable candidate</a> with a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/07/pennsylvania-senate-race-conor-lamb-502749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more moderate profile</a> and three House wins on competitive turf, while Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta are hoping to leverage their connections to the far more vote-rich Philadelphia region. Arkoosh and Kenyatta aim to make history, too, with their bids. Arkoosh would be the state’s first woman senator, while Kenyatta would be the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/malcolm-kenyatta-2022-pennsylvania-senate-campaign-20210219.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Black person and openly gay individual</a> to hold that office.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Wisconsin, Johnson is running again, meaning all attention is on who Democrats will nominate, and right now, the early front-runner looks to be Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, a Black progressive who won his current office in 2018 and appears to have started this latest bid with a <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/11/dfp_wi_senate_crosstabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong name recognition advantage</a>. But Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski have also said they’re running and have until the Aug. 9 primary to eat into Barnes’s early lead. There’s also little question that Lasry will have ample financial resources, perhaps more than any other candidate, as <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/WI/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s led the Democratic field in fundraising</a> and <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/daniel-bice/2021/08/13/us-senate-candidate-alex-lasry-is-bucks-vice-president-dad-is-marc-lasry-worked-in-obama-white-house/5459367001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is the son of the Bucks’ billionaire owner</a>. But Godlewski <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/democratic-senate-candidate-sarah-godlewski-puts-1-million-into-race/article_43d69a0a-68d3-51ae-91cb-a84858ba675a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also put $1 million</a> of her own wealth into the race and <a href="https://emilyslist.org/news/entry/emilys-list-endorses-sarah-godlewski-for-u.s.-senate-in-wisconsin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has an endorsement from EMILY’s List</a>. Finally, Outagamie County Exec. Tom Nelson <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/26/tom-nelson-launches-senate-bid-says-ron-johnson-put-people-risk/6038396002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also running</a>, although he may find it difficult to gain traction with three better-funded contenders facing him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In North Carolina, meanwhile, the Democratic primary has already been sorted out as state Sen. Jeff Jackson <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/15/jeff-jackson-north-carolina-senate-race-524970" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out of the race</a> in December and endorsed his rival, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley. But on the Republican side, former Gov. Pat McCrory and Rep. Ted Budd appear to be in a real knock-down, drag-out fight. McCrory <a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/9dda8e10/files/uploaded/NC%20Republican%20Primary%20Survey%20Memo%20%286-14%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led early on</a>, but <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/259a50ef0a1608ab2bc2cf891/files/88fc09cb-e0e7-81a8-c747-025885c19dd7/19091_JLF_NC_Toplines_v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Budd’s polling numbers have improved</a> over the past few months thanks to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/05/politics/north-carolina-senate-race-ted-budd-donald-trump/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00487470/?tab=spending" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some $4 million</a> from the conservative Club for Growth’s super PAC, which <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article257566828.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has committed $10 million</a> to the race. Given Budd’s newfound advantage, <a href="https://www.wral.com/new-election-dates-and-opponents-bring-candidates-new-campaign-challenges/20090266/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he could also benefit</a> from the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/08/1062542865/north-carolina-delays-2022-primaries-to-give-redistricting-challenges-more-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state supreme court’s decision</a> to delay the primary from Mar. 8 to May 17. (It’s possible, too, that it could be delayed even further to June 7 given litigation over redistricting.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond these three GOP-held seats, perhaps Florida and Ohio, and possibly Missouri, might get competitive, although Republicans currently have the upper hand in all three. In Florida, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio is likely to win reelection against Democratic Rep. Val Demings, thanks in large part to Florida’s GOP lean, although Demings, a Black woman who previously served as Orlando’s chief of police, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/17/democrats-florida-senate-demings-rubio-516131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be about the strongest candidate Democrats could run</a>. Meanwhile, crowded GOP primaries in <a href="https://www.wvxu.org/politics/2021-12-08/analysis-gop-senate-primary-may-be-ohios-ugliest-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/12/23/missouri-senate-race-republican-primary-candidates-set-forum-2022-billy-long-eric-schmitt/9006275002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missouri</a> could nominate weak candidates and make those races more competitive — disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned in 2018 over a sexual abuse case, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eric-greitens-seeks-comeback-missouri-us-senate-gop-4e77ad06d66767365bfcdfee62bb0ef0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially stands out</a> in the Show Me State. But even then, Republicans could easily hold onto both seats, especially in a friendly electoral environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Missouri and Ohio are likely to remain in Republican hands, but they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/alabama-senate-trump/2021/12/18/4363b67e-5e87-11ec-8665-aed48580f911_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">along with Alabama</a> will have primary battles that could help shape the future of the GOP, while the race for an open Senate seat in deep blue Vermont <a href="https://www.necn.com/news/local/vermont-could-send-its-first-woman-to-congress-3-vying-for-the-job/2651983/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could elect the first woman</a> to ever represent the Green Mountain State in Congress. But that said, the battle for Senate control will likely rest on Sun Belt states like Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, as well as Frost Belt states like New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">2021 was bookended by high-profile elections. In early January, traditionally GOP-leaning Georgia <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate</a> in two runoff elections, tipping control of the chamber into Democratic hands. Less than 10 months later, on Nov. 2, blue-leaning <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia elected a Republican to statewide office</a> for the first time since 2009. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, the races in those two states were fought in very different contexts — and had very different outcomes. But even so, they shared a key feature, as our analysis of precinct-level data makes clear: The losing party lost the most ground on its own home turf. In Virginia, it was heavily pro-Biden precincts that delivered the governor’s seat to the GOP, while in Georgia, it was heavily pro-Trump precincts that sent two Democrats to the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why is that noteworthy? First, the results provide a valuable reminder that while voters tend to seek balance by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-that-loses-this-year-could-still-win-a-big-consolation-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing the party</a> out of power, that balancing isn’t guaranteed. Voters’ support for the party out of power depends on both parties’ positions, candidates and rhetoric. Also, at a time when commentators have emphasized <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/jonathan-a-rodden/why-cities-lose/9781541644250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geographic</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/17/upshot/partisan-segregation-maps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">segregation</a> by party, our joint analysis of Virginia and Georgia found that both election outcomes hinged on <em>reduced</em> geographic polarization, with each party losing ground in its respective stronghold to the other.<br><br>Let’s start with Virginia. To understand how now-Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin defeated Terry McAuliffe in a state in which now-President Biden defeated former President Donald Trump by 10 percentage points in the 2020 presidential election, we compared McAuliffe’s vote share to Biden’s and Youngkin’s vote share to Trump’s in each election precinct. From left to right, we then plotted the change in votes from the 2020 presidential election to the 2021 gubernatorial election by how much a precinct supported Trump in 2020. Where the lines are flat in the chart, gubernatorial performance equals presidential; downward slopes mean that the gubernatorial candidates performed worse than their party’s presidential candidates, upward slopes better. The steeper the slope, the bigger the change those precincts provided to the outcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as the chart makes clear, McAuliffe’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-virginias-electorate-shifted-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest underperformance relative to Biden</a> came in heavily Biden-leaning areas. We see that in the blue line’s sharp drops on the left side of the chart — and that McAuliffe’s underperformance there was much larger than his losing margin of 64,000 votes.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hill.hopkins.TRUMP-TURNOUT.1206.1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hill.hopkins.TRUMP-TURNOUT.1206.1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hill.hopkins.TRUMP-TURNOUT.1206.1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hill.hopkins.TRUMP-TURNOUT.1206.1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Now, in a lower-turnout race, you might expect a party to lose most of its votes in the communities where its support was initially higher.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turnout was &lt;a href="https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2021%20November%20General/Site/Statistics/Turnout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;26 percent lower&lt;/a&gt; in the Virginia gubernatorial election than &lt;a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/144567/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, with both McAuliffe and Youngkin receiving fewer votes than Biden and Trump. Of course, we would expect a non-presidential election to have lower turnout than a presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> But the story here is more complicated because if we look at heavily Republican Virginia precincts — those that gave Trump at least 70 percent of their two-party votes, which are on the chart’s right side — Youngkin saw a net <em>gain</em> of nearly 3,000 votes. That’s striking: For all the coverage of Trump’s strength in certain communities, Youngkin actually <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outperformed</a> Trump in Virginia’s most pro-Trump precincts in an off-year election.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some caution is warranted here because absentee ballots are only reported at the county level, and the 2020 election saw nearly double the rate of mail-in ballots as the 2021 election. That means some of the change in votes is likely due to 2020 absentee voters returning to in-person precinct voting in 2021, although given the extent of &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-absentee-voting-looked-like-in-all-50-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;partisan divisions in vote method in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, that alone doesn’t explain the patterns we document here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, it was in the pro-Biden precincts that this race was decided. In those precincts, the Democratic vote total dropped by hundreds of thousands, giving Youngkin the margin he needed to win.<br><br>As for the Georgia Senate runoff elections, our second case study, the Democrats actually won both races even though <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-that-loses-this-year-could-still-win-a-big-consolation-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off-cycle elections</a> tend to go <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-virginias-and-new-jerseys-elections-could-suggest-a-red-wave-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poorly for the president’s party</a>. Technically, Trump was still president and in his final days of office, but by the time of the Jan. 5 runoffs, it was clear Biden had won the presidency and would be soon assuming office. As such, GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler should have been well positioned for the runoff. After all, in a similar situation in 2008, then-Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss turned a 3-point lead in the first round in November into a win of almost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2008/results/states/georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 points</a> in the December runoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the period between November 2020 and January 2021 was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-trumps-refusal-to-concede-says-about-american-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardly ordinary</a>, given Trump persistently and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/we-won-trump-spreads-misinformation-about-2020-election-during-final-n1252802" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falsely insisted</a> that he had, in fact, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/05/politics/donald-trump-georgia-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the presidential election</a>. He also repeatedly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked Georgia election officials</a>, pressuring them to overturn the results of the election. And, of course, this all culminated in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, the day after the Georgia runoffs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is important for understanding what happened in Georgia, because Trump’s rhetoric had the potential to undermine faith in voting and possibly dampen turnout among Trump’s supporters. Trump’s claim that he had won the election also made <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/06/william-barrs-trump-administration-attorney-general/619298/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it harder</a> for Perdue and Loeffler to convince voters that, if they returned to the Senate, they would serve as a check on the new Democratic president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, we should be careful not to focus on just one explanation. Trump’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had also fallen</a> between November and January, and other events, including the Republicans’ and Democrats’ campaigns, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/georgia-senate-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have proven influential</a>, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But once again, to understand how each party won in a state that usually backs the other, we compared their vote share to Biden’s and Trump’s in the 2020 presidential election across precincts. In this case, we just looked at Perdue’s race against Ossoff, as that contest proved closer (1.2 points) than Warnock’s against Loeffler’s (2 points).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turnout declined less dramatically in Georgia from the presidential to the runoff than in Virginia from the presidential to the gubernatorial,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turnout in the January 2021 runoffs was down by 10.3 percent compared to the November presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> but as in Virgina, we plotted the change in two-party votes from the 2020 presidential election by how much a precinct supported Trump in 2020. And as you can see in the chart below, both Ossoff and Perdue won fewer votes relative to their party’s presidential candidates in all types of precincts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the places where they lost votes weren’t even. There was pro-Democratic mobilization in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily Black areas</a>, but the votes cast did not quite keep pace with presidential votes from 2020 (lines slope slightly downward). Ossoff lost more ground relative to the November presidential race in heavily pro-Biden precincts, meaning that Perdue improved on Trump’s margin in those precincts. In fact, if Perdue had also received Trump’s margin over Biden elsewhere, he would have won. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s not what happened. Instead, Perdue ended up losing the election primarily because of underperformance in heavily pro-Trump precincts, as the sharp downward slope of the Republican line on the chart’s right side makes clear.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="958" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hill.hopkins.TRUMP-TURNOUT.1206.2-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hill.hopkins.TRUMP-TURNOUT.1206.2-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hill.hopkins.TRUMP-TURNOUT.1206.2-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hill.hopkins.TRUMP-TURNOUT.1206.2-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Simply put, Perdue lost the election in places where Trump did best. We cannot say for certain why he underperformed so substantially heavily pro-Trump precincts — whether the underperformance reflected <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe3272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turnout, persuasion or both</a>. But because Ossoff did not see large gains relative to Biden in those precincts, it is reasonable to think Perdue’s problem was, at least in part, that many November Trump voters stayed home in January.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Right after the January runoffs in Georgia, it seemed quite plausible that in heavily pro-Trump precincts, Trump had a mobilization advantage over a more traditional Republican like Perdue. But the Virginia results showed that another businessman-turned-politician could outperform Trump, even in Trump’s strongholds and even in a governor’s race in which overall turnout was less than in the presidential election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When viewed alongside Virginia, decreased turnout in heavily Republican precincts in Georgia’s runoffs lends itself to another interpretation. Republicans don’t always face a disadvantage without Trump on the ballot — Virginia makes that clear. But they did face a disadvantage before Biden took office, when Trump’s false election claims and accusations against Georgia elections officials were at a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-congress-reverse-election-loss-e2a6fa060432bd19d92a142a0da5688e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fever pitch</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But perhaps the biggest takeaway is that in both contests, Virginia in November and Georgia in January, the losing party faltered most on its own home field. </p>]]></description>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">After nearly two years of living in a pandemic, many Americans have started to return to “normal” life. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, 74 percent of Americans said their lives had returned to normal, according to a November <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-as-winter-covid-surge-begins-74-percent-of-americans-say-their-lives-have-returned-to-normal-225616185.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo News/YouGov poll</a>. But the new COVID-19 variant, omicron, could once again <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-a-shot-girl-summer-but-america-is-still-not-fully-back-to-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change how Americans feel</a> about getting back to their pre-COVID lives. A recent <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2021/11/30/2c240/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov survey</a> found that 33 percent of Americans said they were somewhat concerned by the omicron variant, and 21 percent said they were very concerned. Other polling had similar findings: <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/583818-poll-68-percent-concerned-about-the-omicron-covid-19-variant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent The Hill/HarrisX poll</a> found that 41 percent of voters were somewhat concerned and 27 percent were very concerned.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The World Health Organization classified omicron as a “variant of concern” <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nov. 26</a>, shortly after South African officials flagged the variant (although recent retesting of older samples has shown that omicron was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/30/1060025081/omicron-variant-netherlands-europe-south-africa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Europe about a week prior</a>). But there isn’t that much known about the variant at this point. For instance, we don’t know <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how transmissible omicron</a> is compared with other variants, and the severity of an infection from omicron remains unclear, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There isn’t that much polling on how Americans are reacting to the omicron variant yet, either, but a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2021/11/30/44ca4/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov poll</a> conducted on Nov. 30 found that 38 percent of Americans thought the variant posed a serious risk to all Americans, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, although 25 percent of respondents were unsure on the variant’s risk level. And the country thinks restrictions are on the way. <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Data-Tables-Wave-92.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Harris Poll</a> found that 87 percent of adults thought the omicron variant would very or somewhat likely lead to a higher case rate and new restrictions. But Americans seem prepared to take precautions. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/30/covid-omicron-variant-polling-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Nov. 29-30 found that large majorities of Americans were willing to take a number of precautions to stop the spread of omicron, such as mandatory mask usage and encouraging vaccination and booster shots. However, Americans were less supportive of closing businesses or government facilities to combat omicron — just 44 percent supported this.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Some reports suggest that current vaccines might be <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-omicron-variant-vaccine-moderna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less effective against omicron</a>, but at <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=81441585" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a briefing on Wednesday about the first U.S. case of omicron</a>, Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical officer to the president, stressed that Americans should still get their primary vaccination and a booster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, one reason why variants keep cropping up is because so much of the world is unvaccinated. Researchers have found that <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low vaccination rates allow COVID-19 to spread more easily</a>, which thereby increases the possibility that the virus will mutate. And currently,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> only about 55 percent of the world’s population has received one vaccine dose, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Our World in Data</a> — and this number falls to just 6 percent in low-income countries. In South Africa, where omicron was first identified, only 29 percent of the population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A majority of Americans (76 percent) told Morning Consult that providing vaccines to low-income countries was important for controlling omicron, but poorer countries <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/09/1100192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have long lacked access to the vaccines because of distribution issues and the cost of the shots.</a></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In late summer and early fall, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-19/biden-s-vaccine-booster-and-export-plans-to-collide-at-summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was criticized</a> for encouraging Americans to seek booster shots, given how terribly poorer countries have struggled with access to the vaccines. But most Americans, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/09/15/majority-in-u-s-says-public-health-benefits-of-covid-19-restrictions-worth-the-costs-even-as-large-shares-also-see-downsides/#few-americans-know-access-to-vaccines-is-limited-in-developing-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then</a> and now, support getting booster shots to protect themselves. In that same Morning Consult poll, a strong majority of U.S. adults (70 percent) said the encouragement of boosters was an important measure to fight the new variant. And even before the omicron variant was identified, the number of Americans getting boosters was up, according to an <a href="https://echeloninsights.com/in-the-news/november-omnibus-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echelon Insights poll</a>. The number of registered voters who said they’d gotten the booster increased 15 percentage points between October and November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The willingness of Americans to get boosters and share vaccines with other countries is a good sign, but much of the world remains unvaccinated. That means while vaccines have proven to be effective against COVID-19, it’s likely variants will continue to emerge until more of the global population is vaccinated.</p>

<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/18/phil-scott-approval-vermont-polling-senate-race/">America’s second-most popular governor</a>, announced on Wednesday that he will not seek <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/01/massachusetts-charlie-baker-reelection-523597">a third term</a> next year. Baker was always a bit of an outlier in a state as blue as Massachusetts, but he likely owed his success to his appeal to moderate voters; he was also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/14/politics/republican-massachusetts-governor-charlie-baker-not-support-trump/index.html">a critic of former President Donald Trump</a>. But now, according to <a href="https://democraticgovernors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DGA-Polling-Memo-Status-of-the-MA-GOP-Primary.pdf">an October survey</a> by Public Policy Polling on behalf of the Democratic Governors Association, Republicans in the state might be looking to nominate someone who embraces more of Trump’s agenda. A large majority of the state’s Republican voters (75 percent) would prefer a nominee who embraced Trump’s agenda, and 50 percent would pick <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/06/trump-gop-rival-charlie-baker-515467">Trump-backed Republican Geoff Diehl</a> over Baker if the primary were held on the day they were surveyed. And with Baker now out, Diehl is <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/01/metro/here-are-all-declared-candidates-running-massachusetts-governor-2022/">the only prominent Republican candidate</a> to have announced he’s running. (There are two other Republicans in the running, but they have lower profiles.) At this point, the Democratic side has three major candidates vying for the nomination, but all eyes seem to be on the state’s <a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2021/12/with-gov-charlie-baker-not-seeking-a-third-term-who-is-running-to-be-the-next-governor-of-massachusetts.html">Democratic Attorney General Maura Healy</a> and whether she will join the race.</li><li>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments about a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, and conservative justices on the court seemed to suggest in their questions that they’d be <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-hears-historic-case-fate-abortion-rights/story?id=81488696">willing to uphold Mississippi’s law</a> — and maybe even overturn Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973. As my colleague Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/">wrote earlier this week</a>: Polls consistently show that a strong majority of Americans don’t want Roe overturned. At the same time, Americans' views on the issue tend to be murky: Most want some restriction on abortion, but only 28 percent thought it was too easy to obtain the procedure, according to <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/">a Kaiser Family Foundation survey from early last year</a>. And regarding the Mississippi law specifically, an <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/11/16/supporters-and-opponents-roe-v-wade-see-scotus?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=website_article&amp;utm_campaign=roe_v_wade_nov_2021">Economist/YouGov poll</a> from early November found that Americans were split: 42 percent of adults approved of the law, and 42 percent disapproved.</li><li>Last week, a Georgia jury found three white men <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/jury-reaches-verdict-ahmaud-arbery-death-case/story?id=81353504">guilty of murdering Amaud Arbery</a>, a Black man who the men chased and shot to death while he was jogging. Most Americans (68 percent) approved of the jury’s verdicts, with 65 percent agreeing that justice was served, according to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/29/ahmaud-arbery-verdict-poll/">recent Morning Consult poll</a>. This might have something to do with how prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/19/us/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-race.html">didn’t target race or bigotry in their arguments</a>. Morning Consult’s polling shows that Black (77 percent) and white (67 percent) Americans similarly approved of the verdict.</li><li>In the middle of November, Kyle Rittenhouse was found <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/jury-reaches-verdict-kyle-rittenhouse-homicide-trial/story?id=81108654">not guilty on all charges</a> after he'd shot three men, killing two and injuring another, during last summer’s protests against the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The case centered on whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense or as a vigilante, and how Americans view the verdict largely hinges on their stance on this, per <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/22/rittenhouse-verdict-poll/">polling from Morning Consult</a>. They found that 87 percent of people who thought Rittenhouse was protecting the public approved of the verdict, while 77 percent of those who thought Rittenhouse was in Kenosha to provoke violence disapproved of the verdict. Overall, Americans were pretty split on the verdict, with 43 percent of Americans approving of Rittenhouse’s acquittal and 39 percent disapproving of it. </li><li>Around the globe, people see racial and ethnic discrimination <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/02/more-people-globally-see-racial-ethnic-discrimination-as-a-serious-problem-in-the-u-s-than-in-their-own-society/">as a greater problem in the U.S.</a> than in their own country, per a Pew Research Center survey. A median of 89 percent of adults across 16 countries with advanced economies thought discrimination was a serious problem in the U.S., while a median of 67 percent thought discrimination was a serious problem in their home country.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in one of the highest-profile cases of the term, and the question now before the court is whether Mississippi’s law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy is constitutional. So far, the law has been blocked from going into effect because of the legal precedent from Roe v. Wade, which grants the constitutional right to abortion. And subsequent decisions by the court have meant that states may not ban abortion before fetal viability, which happens at around 24 weeks, but that is being tested now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, senior politics writer and legal reporter Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux discusses how the justices approached the question during oral arguments and what Americans think about abortion policy. The conventional wisdom is that Americans’ views are highly polarized and deeply entrenched, but the reality is more complicated than that.</p>

			<title>Redistricting Has Maintained The Status Quo So Far. That’s Good For Republicans.</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The “2021 redistricting cycle” is about to become the “2022 redistricting cycle.” As we enter the final month of the year, only 18 states are finished redrawing their congressional districts (not counting the six states with only one district), a consequence of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-delayed-census-has-affected-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed release of census data</a>. Nevertheless, our view of the U.S. House battlefield for 2022 (and beyond) is starting to come into focus. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As detailed on the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight redistricting tracker</a>, 157 congressional districts have been drawn so far. Ninety have a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> of R+5 or redder, 55 have a partisan lean of D+5 or bluer and only 12 are in the “highly competitive” zone between R+5 and D+5. Compared with the old lines, this represents a net gain of six Democratic-leaning seats and two Republican-leaning seats and a net loss of five highly competitive seats.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1130" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image001.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image001.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image001.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image001.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That Democrats have picked up more seats than Republicans at this point is unexpected. Going into this redistricting cycle, Republicans had <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.5 times as many districts as Democrats</a> to redraw (187 versus 75), yet that hasn’t translated into big GOP gains so far. Republicans have pulled their punches somewhat in states such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/indiana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana</a>, where they could have converted the Democratic-leaning 1st District into a red seat (they didn’t), and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/iowa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa</a>, where they could have overridden the state’s nonpartisan redistricting agency to draw more solidly red seats (they didn’t do that, either). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, Democrats have gone for the jugular in each of the few opportunities they’ve had so far to gain seats. They used <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/09/20/after-slow-start-redistricting-proposals-get-moving-in-salem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardball tactics</a> to push through a map for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oregon</a> that eliminates one highly competitive seat and adds two Democratic-leaning seats. And they turned <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois</a>’s map from one with 11 Democratic-leaning seats, five Republican-leaning seats and two highly competitive (but slightly Republican-leaning) seats to one with 13 Democratic-leaning seats, three Republican-leaning seats and one highly competitive (but slightly Democratic-leaning) seat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, our definitions of what is a “Republican-leaning” or “Democratic-leaning” seat are only one way of calculating each party’s net gains and losses. You can also look at who represents the newly drawn seats, and this method suggests more of an edge for Republicans in redistricting so far this year. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For example, a lot of those newly added Democratic seats are already represented by Democrats (they’re swing seats that the party won thanks to their strong performance in the 2018 and 2020 elections), so they don’t represent opportunities for Democrats to <em>pick up</em> House seats. In fact, if we just factor in which party currently holds the seat, I calculate that Republicans have already picked up two or three seats through redistricting alone. They’ve gained three seats via reapportionment (one each in Montana, North Carolina and Texas) and also turned two existing Democratic districts red (Rep. Kathy Manning’s seat in North Carolina and Rep. Marcy Kaptur’s seat in Ohio). However, they’ve also lost two seats via reapportionment (one each in Illinois and West Virginia), and one other (the Illinois 13th) was turned blue by Democratic cartographers. (That’s a net gain of two. The possibility for a third gained seat comes in Colorado, whose new 8th District has a partisan lean of R+3. Theoretically, that district would elect a Republican in a neutral political environment, but it’s close enough to be uncertain.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democrats have come out even. They’ve gained two seats via reapportionment (one in Oregon, one in Texas) and redrawn one existing Republican district (the Illinois 13th, again) to favor Democrats. However, they’ve also lost one seat in reapportionment (in Ohio), and two of their seats have been redrawn to be red (again, Manning’s and Kaptur’s).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, any redistricting assessment that focuses on gains and losses — whether based on the change in a district’s partisan lean or who now controls the seat — obscures an important way in which Republicans have benefited from redistricting this year: They’ve taken already Republican-leaning seats and moved them totally out of Democrats’ reach. If you look under the hood of the GOP’s two-seat gain, you can see that although they have lost nine light-red seats (which we define as having a partisan lean between R+5 and R+15), they have <em>gained</em> 11 dark-red seats (R+15 or redder).</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Some districts where Republicans pulled this trick include Indiana’s 5th District, which went from a R+8 partisan lean to R+22, as well as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/oklahoma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma</a>’s 5th District and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/utah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utah</a>’s 4th District, two seats that Democrats won in 2018 but narrowly lost in 2020.

<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, the seats they’ve added so far in this redistricting cycle are less safe than the ones Republicans have added. In a twist, this is actually by Democrats’ own choice: Both seats they gained in Oregon are light blue, and in Illinois they shed one solidly Democratic seat in service of adding three competitive Democratic ones. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though counterintuitive, this is a sound strategy if Democrats want to eliminate the overall Republican bias in the House of Representatives. If you have only a finite number of Democratic voters, it’s more efficient to spread them out over a greater number of light-blue districts than a smaller number of dark-blue districts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The new Democratic-drawn map in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a> is a perfect example of this: It moves the partisan lean of the Las Vegas-based 1st District from D+22 to D+4 — but two neighboring swing districts get more Democratic as a result (the 3rd goes from R+5 to D+2; the 4th goes from R+1 to D+5). In a strong election year for Republicans (which 2022 is likely to be), this makes all three Democratic-held districts (including the formerly safe 1st) vulnerable to the GOP. But Democrats might be OK with that tradeoff, as any election that results in the loss of slightly Democratic-leaning seats is probably an election in which Republicans have already won the House handily. Instead, the goal of these new maps in Illinois, Nevada and Oregon seems to be to maximize the number of Democratic wins in neutral political environments, when the House is genuinely competitive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, the question of which party has gained ground in redistricting so far is pretty muddled. Any way you slice it, though, there are two clear takeaways from the maps that have already been drawn. First, the number of competitive House districts — which has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-swing-districts-dwindle-can-a-divided-house-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the decline for several decades now</a> — is on track to hit a new low. Only 8 percent of the districts drawn so far fall into our “highly competitive” category, which, if it holds, could mean the House will be fought on a historically small battlefield over the next decade. (Election nerds, get ready to become very familiar with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nebraska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nebraska</a>’s 2nd District!) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there’s some reason to think the share of swing seats will increase from here. Eighty-seven percent of the districts that have been enacted so far were enacted under single-party rule, but 55 percent of the districts that have yet to be enacted will be drawn via independent or bipartisan means, such as redistricting commissions or the courts.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Second, the new House maps still have an overall bias toward the GOP. The partisan balance of power may not have changed much from the old maps to the new, but the old maps were hardly a neutral baseline: They were disproportionately drawn by Republicans during the 2011 redistricting cycle, after the red-wave election of 2010. So a 2021 redistricting cycle that largely maintains the status quo is good news for Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our redistricting tracker uses <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-redistricting-tracker-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a couple of different metrics</a> to measure the bias of congressional maps: the efficiency gap (the difference between the two parties’ “wasted votes” divided by the total number of voters)<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wasted votes” are defined as all votes cast for the losing party in a district as well as votes for the winning party in excess of a majority. To take a simple example, imagine a state with three districts — two of which Republicans win 60 votes to 40 votes, and one of which Democrats win 90 votes to 10 votes. Democrats have 40 wasted votes in each of the first two districts and 39 in the third (because they won 39 more votes than 51, the district’s majority threshold), for a total of 119. Meanwhile, Republicans have nine wasted votes in each of the first two districts and 10 in the third district, for a total of 28. The map’s efficiency gap is therefore 91 (119 minus 28) divided by 300 (the total number of votes in all three districts), or 30.3 percentage points in favor of Republicans. Since there have been no House elections under the new maps yet, we calculate the efficiency gap for all maps based on the results of the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> and the difference between a state’s partisan lean and that of its median congressional district. And on both measures, Republican-biased maps are both more numerous and more severe in their bias than Democratic-biased maps.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">All four maps that have been enacted so far in states where Democrats control redistricting (Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon) have heavy Democratic biases going by efficiency gap (though, interestingly, Nevada is alone among them in having a Democratic median-seat bias). But eight GOP-controlled states have passed maps with significantly pro-Republican efficiency gaps, and most of those have Republican-leaning median seats too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s no foolproof statistical test for gerrymandering, but our metrics suggest the maps in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a> (R+20 efficiency gap, R+11 median-seat bias), Utah (R+29 efficiency gap, albeit a D+1 median-seat bias) and Texas (R+15 efficiency gap, R+12 median-seat bias) are some of the most egregious of the cycle so far.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an illustration of why not to put all your eggs in the basket of any one metric, I wouldn’t consider Iowa an unfair map even though it has the highest efficiency gap of all, R+42. That’s because three of its four districts are at least somewhat competitive. Its efficiency gap is so skewed because all four districts voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020, and therefore, every vote for President Biden in Iowa was “wasted” by efficiency gap’s definition. But in a different election — say, 2018, when Democrats won three of the state’s four House seats — it would be a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of these maps, in fact, are so egregious that they may not survive long enough to get used in the 2022 elections (much less beyond that). Democrats have already filed lawsuits against several Republican-enacted congressional maps, including <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/north-carolina-republicans-passed-a-heavily-skewed-congressional-map-how-will-the-courts-respond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering suits in North Carolina</a>. They’re also arguing that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a>’s new map (which has an R+16 efficiency gap and makes 11 of the state’s 15 districts Republican-leaning) violates the <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/2021/11/22/redistricting-eric-holder-backed-lawsuit-challenges-ohio-congressional-map/8710272002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan-fairness requirement for redistricting</a> in the state constitution, and that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alabama</a> ought to give Black voters the chance to elect a candidate of their choice in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-lawsuits-race-and-ethnicity-redistricting-montgomery-38e76cb85abe91e9007db0f278764c4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two districts, not just one</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If any of these lawsuits are successful, fairer replacement maps could wind up tilting the 2021 redistricting scales toward Democrats in a more unambiguous way. So, going forward, make sure you keep checking our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting tracker</a>, which we’ll update in real time with any such developments.</p>

For the third time in six years, the justices will consider the constitutionality of a state law designed to restrict abortion — this time, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Mississippi ban</a> on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. And because the court is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more conservative than it’s been in decades</a>, many experts believe <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/18/supreme-court-just-took-case-that-could-kill-roe-v-wade-or-let-it-die-slowly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s a real possibility</a> that the justices will use this case to overturn — or at least severely limit — the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 by Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roe may be one of the only Supreme Court decisions that most Americans can identify. In all likelihood, it’s more familiar to the average voter than the names of <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/403992-poll-more-than-half-of-americans-cant-name-single-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any justice</a> currently serving on the Supreme Court. Surprisingly, though, trying to understand what Americans think about abortion rights — and how they’d react if Roe was reversed or reshaped — can feel like walking into a fogbank. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ask Americans whether Roe should be overruled, and the answer seems pretty straightforward: Polls consistently find that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority think</a> the Supreme Court should keep the ruling in place. But Americans’ views on abortion are hardly clear-cut. Majorities also support <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730183531/poll-majority-want-to-keep-abortion-legal-but-they-also-want-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a variety of restrictions on abortion</a> — including limits on abortion in the second trimester — that openly conflict with the Supreme Court’s rulings. For example, <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation poll found</a> that 69 percent of Americans favored laws requiring abortions to be performed only by doctors who had admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, even though <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court ruled in 2016</a> that those laws place an unconstitutional burden on women’s right to abortion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why is it so hard to distill views on an issue that’s been at the forefront of American politics <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2013/01/16/a-history-of-key-abortion-rulings-of-the-us-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for nearly five decades</a>? Given the longstanding, intractable division on abortion, one might think that Americans hold murky views because they’re actively, even painfully, wrestling with the matter. But that’s not what I found when I dug into the issue. The truth is that many Americans just don’t like talking or thinking about abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also don’t know a lot about the procedure or restrictions around it, and when it comes to the politics of abortion, they see an endless loop. In interviews, people told me over and over again that they want the country to find a quiet middle ground — yet the debate keeps getting more heated and extreme.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Fuck no, I don’t talk to people about abortion,” said Jeremy, a 34-year-old man who asked me not to disclose his last name and location. “I have other political discussions with my friends, and we can do pretty well on that. But the second I would say, ‘I think there should be reasonable limits on abortion after the first trimester,’ people would jump down my throat.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abortion also isn’t an especially high political priority for people like Jeremy, despite — or perhaps because of — its ubiquitousness. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vy4b1z4v2q/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a YouGov/The Economist poll</a> conducted in October, only 4 percent of Americans ranked abortion as their top issue, coming in behind jobs and the economy, climate change, immigration, health care, taxes and civil rights. “I think people are tired [of this issue] and they hate it at election time,” said Tresa Undem, a researcher at the nonpartisan firm PerryUndem who studies attitudes toward abortion. “They think politicians are pandering for votes.” Instead, according to Undem, many Americans think both sides of the debate are right — and wrong. “It’s kind of like, ‘Yes, abortion is ending a potential life, and yes, women should be able to make a choice. Move on.’”</p>



<h2><strong>Most Americans fall into a gray zone on abortion</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, perspectives on abortion tend to fall into three main camps. The first camp is a relatively small chunk of Americans (about 10 to 15 percent) who think abortion should be illegal in all cases. The second camp is a larger minority (about 25 to 30 percent) who want abortion to be legal in all cases. And the third camp is the majority of Americans (about 55 to 65 percent), who fall into a gray area, telling pollsters that they want abortion to be legal in some or most cases. That final category is all over the place, as it includes both people who think abortion should be legal only in cases of rape, incest and when the mother’s life is at risk, as well as people who think abortion should be legal with only limited restrictions, perhaps for minors or for abortions in later stages of pregnancy.</p>

Total bans on abortion, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which have now passed in three states</a>, are popular only with a small sliver of the public. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But most Americans support at least some restrictions on abortion, too. “I lean more toward the pro-life side of things, and I don’t think abortion is something that should just be available to everyone all the time, but I also don’t like how everyone is so extreme,” said Amanda, 38. She asked me to withhold identifying information, such as her last name and location, because she feels caught between her family, which is staunchly anti-abortion, and her liberal friends. When I asked her where the line should be drawn, she suggested a ban on abortion somewhere between 12 and 20 weeks. “I think that would be a good, moderate middle ground,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly identifying an acceptable middle ground on abortion isn’t easy for most people to do, though. That’s in part because many Americans don’t know much about abortion to begin with, and perhaps as a result, their views aren’t usually more specific than a belief that the procedure should be available in at least some cases.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/235469/trimesters-key-abortion-views.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup has consistently found</a> that while a majority (around 60 percent) of Americans thought abortion should be generally legal in the first trimester of pregnancy, much smaller shares thought abortion should be generally legal in the second trimester (nearly 30 percent), although Roe protects the right to abortion until the last few weeks of the second trimester, when the fetus <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/obstetric-care-consensus/articles/2017/10/periviable-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be able to survive</a> outside the womb. </p>

According to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730183531/poll-majority-want-to-keep-abortion-legal-but-they-also-want-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/upshot/politicians-draw-clear-lines-on-abortion-their-parties-are-not-so-unified.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the General Social Survey</a>, Americans are much likelier to support abortion rights when the woman’s health is endangered than if she wants an abortion for another reason. The NPR poll found that 61 percent of respondents favored a level of restriction beyond the current standard under Roe. And the 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that Americans mostly supported some restrictions on abortion access, like a mandatory ultrasound before an abortion can be obtained. But that same Kaiser also poll found that only 28 percent of Americans thought it was too easy to get an abortion, and a majority (61 percent) wanted their state to protect women’s access to abortion. <a href="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6100683/Vox_Final_Toplines__1_.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2016 Vox/PerryUndem survey</a> found that majorities of Americans also thought that women should be able to get a legal abortion in their own community, without facing pressure to change their mind.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lack of knowledge about reproductive health in general is a huge issue for researchers like <a href="https://publichealth.indiana.edu/research/faculty-directory/profile.html?user=knjozkow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristen Jozkowski</a>, a professor of sexual health at Indiana University, who are trying to figure out what Americans think about abortion. “People don’t understand something as basic as gestational age,” Jozkowski said. That makes it quite difficult to figure out what they think about, for instance, a 15-week abortion ban, which requires a fairly nuanced understanding of how pregnancies develop. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In general, Americans think abortions happen later in a pregnancy than they typically do — and very few know that only a small share of abortions happen late in pregnancy. Many people think <a href="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6100683/Vox_Final_Toplines__1_.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortions are much less safe than they are</a>, too. And according to the Vox/PerryUndem survey, most aren’t aware of what abortion restrictions are on the books in their own area. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7409738/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2020 study focusing on women found</a> that respondents correctly answered only 18 percent of questions about abortion regulations in their state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most people also aren’t aware of what would happen in their own state if Roe v. Wade were overturned. According to that 2020 Kaiser poll, only 38 percent of people living in <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states with “trigger laws”</a> knew that abortion would immediately become illegal in their state, and only 35 percent of people in states without trigger laws knew that abortion would stay legal. This means that when people are answering questions about whether Roe should be overturned, most don’t have an accurate sense of what reversing the ruling would mean for their state and community.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">So, when people are surveyed about whether they support a specific abortion restriction, they often lack key information that would shape their answer. On that same Kaiser poll, for instance, support for an abortion ban after fetal cardiac activity can be detected dropped from 49 percent to 38 percent after respondents were told that many women don’t know they’re pregnant at that point. Similarly, support for an admitting privileges requirement also fell from 69 percent to 52 percent after respondents were told that complications from abortion are very rare and that, when they do happen, women can get hospital care regardless of whether the abortion provider has admitting privileges.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Simple things like one’s own life experience can also shape people’s perspectives. Rachael, 40, who asked me to withhold her last name and location, said that although she supports abortion rights, she understood why someone would want to ban abortion “a bit better” after she had children. “Once you’ve had a relationship with someone that’s not born, it’s easier to feel that sense of like – this is a life, this is a human being.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in many cases, people’s responses may appear ambiguous because they think they simply shouldn’t be making the call about such a personal decision — and neither should politicians. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/nov-7-10-2021-washington-post-abc-news-poll/160508a9-cea2-4433-92c8-6dc51838721e/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to an ABC News/The Washington Post poll</a> conducted in early November, 75 percent of Americans thought abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor, while only 20 percent thought it should be regulated by law. Beverly, who lives in Ohio and asked me to withhold her last name and other identifying details, said that she personally thought it was wrong for someone to have an abortion because they thought they couldn’t afford to have a child, but that she still thought abortion should be legal. “I wish politicians would see moral issues as being out of scope for them. It’s not what they were selected for,” she said.</p>



<h2><strong>Abortion isn’t a high priority for most Americans, either</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s taken as gospel these days that abortion is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-may-now-motivate-democrats-more-than-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a high political priority</a>, but that’s only true for a small subset of people. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polling routinely shows</a> that when Americans are asked to rank their political priorities, abortion falls low on the list. And that actually makes sense, given that most Americans don’t have especially well-formed views on abortion, and many in that middle gray area tend to think the issue is already too political, and that the parties don’t represent them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abigail Lilly, 29, who lives in West Virginia, told me that she didn’t see her position reflected in the political debate over abortion. “The more conservative [perspective] I’ve heard recently is ‘No abortion whatsoever,’” she said, adding that, as a rape survivor, such a view was particularly difficult for her to understand. “I couldn’t imagine having gotten pregnant from that and being forced to carry that child.” But she was also in favor of some limits on abortion, and she disagreed with what she saw as the position of many on the left — namely, that abortion should be legal at any point during a pregnancy. In reality, abortion after 21 weeks of pregnancy <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is extremely rare</a>, and even in blue states, it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/02/06/tough-questions-answers-late-term-abortions-law-women-who-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tends to occur</a> only in extreme circumstances, such as when the mother’s health is endangered or when the fetus isn’t viable. But <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/30/718546468/opponents-fight-efforts-to-protect-late-term-abortion-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much of the recent debate</a> has focused on abortions later in pregnancy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And then there’s the fact that many people simply don’t think abortion rights are in imminent danger. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/anoy7rtkl2/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A YouGov/Economist poll conducted</a> in November found that only 13 percent of Americans thought that it was very likely that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe. It also found that while most (81 percent) Americans said they’d heard at least something about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new law in Texas</a> — which that bans abortion before many women know they’re pregnant — a much smaller share (43 percent) had heard about the Mississippi law, which is going before the Supreme Court today. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">According to Undem, it’s unusual for abortion issues to catch the average American’s attention. “There has to be sustained news coverage for it to break through,” she said. That helps explain why abortion access has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-categorized-hundreds-of-abortion-restrictions-heres-why-the-anti-abortion-movement-is-escalating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so successfully curtailed over the past ten years</a>, with very little public outcry. Many people who support abortion rights in the abstract don’t follow the issue closely and almost certainly haven’t dug into the complex latticework of restrictions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The new Texas law, though, may be the rare exception. Undem conducted focus groups in Texas shortly after the restriction went into effect, and she found that many people knew about the law and were upset by it. “I heard things that I’ve never heard about after any other type of restriction,” she said. “They were realizing this actually has an impact on women.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, abortion <em>can</em> become a salient issue under the right circumstances. Amanda, who told me she wanted a middle ground, said the Texas law went too far for her. “That one is very difficult for me because I do consider myself pro-life, but six weeks is just so early,” she said. “I get where that would be an issue for a lot of people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That underscores the potential risk for the Supreme Court this term. The six-justice conservative majority may be open to overturning Roe — but that would likely spur a backlash. On the other hand, though, the court still has plenty of latitude. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trumps-supreme-court-could-overturn-roe-v-wade-without-overturning-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s a lot of room</a> to further restrict abortion rights without putting a stake through the heart of one of the highest-profile Supreme Court decisions in history. And if that’s the path the court chooses, it might be surprisingly hard to get most Americans to care. </p>
