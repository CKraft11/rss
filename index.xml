<p data-paragraph="main">Pennsylvania was supposed to be the Democrats’ insurance policy. The state’s Senate seat is currently held by a Republican, but Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman has comfortably led the race since August. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If Democrats win Pennsylvania</a>, their chance of winning the Senate would be 81 in 100.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All numbers in this article are as of Oct. 5 at 4 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> It would even allow them to withstand the loss of one of their own Senate seats (say, in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a> or <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a>) and still retain control of the chamber.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But according to three recent polls, Fetterman’s lead is narrowing. According to Suffolk University and USA Today, Fetterman led by <a href="https://www.goerie.com/story/news/politics/state/2022/06/15/suffolk-university-usa-today-poll-pennsylvania-senate-governor-oz-fetterman/65360594007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9 percentage points</a> in June, but a Sept. 27-30 poll gave him a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/04/fetterman-leads-oz-pennsylvania-senate-race/8161323001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-point lead</a>. According to Fox News, Fetterman led by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-oz-supporters-lack-enthusiasm-pennsylvania-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 points</a> in July but by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-pennsylvania-senate-race-narrows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 4 points</a> in a Sept. 22-26 poll. And according to Emerson College, Fetterman was <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/pennsylvania-2022-fetterman-holds-four-point-lead-over-oz-for-us-senate-shapiro-leads-mastriano-by-three/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up 5 points</a> in August but <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/pennsylvania-2022-fettermans-lead-shrinks-in-us-senate-race-shapiros-lead-expands-for-governors-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 2 points</a> in a Sept. 23-26 poll. As a result of these and other polls, Fetterman has gone from an 11-point lead in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a> on Sept. 13 to a 7-point lead today.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="848" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The shift is due in part to Republicans getting off the fence and supporting the Republican candidate, celebrity physician Mehmet Oz. In the <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/PA-crosstabs_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-July-22-26_released-July-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July Fox News poll</a>, 73 percent of Republicans said they supported Oz, and 13 percent were undecided. In the <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/PA-crosstabs_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-September-22-26_released-September-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent Fox News poll</a>, though, 83 percent of Republicans said they supported Oz, and only 4 percent were undecided. Republicans may have been slow to come around to Oz because he isn’t their ideal candidate. Before jumping into politics, he had taken <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-conservative-policy-pa-senate-race-20220419.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberal positions</a> on issues such as abortion and gun control. Then, earlier this year, he barely survived a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/16-gop-primaries-to-watch-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania-idaho-and-oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nasty Republican primary</a> against David McCormick and Kathy Barnette. And, according to the most recent Fox News poll, only 38 percent of Oz supporters said they supported him enthusiastically. By contrast, 61 percent of Fetterman supporters said they were enthusiastic about their candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, this shift is also because Fetterman is losing support. Per Fox News, he led Oz 58 percent to 30 percent among college-educated voters in July. But in September, Fetterman led just 50 percent to 39 percent among these voters. (By contrast, non-college-educated voters barely changed their minds.) And according to Suffolk, Fetterman led among Black voters 71 percent to 6 percent <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/6_17_2022_pennsylvania_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=0FCA094D69AEFC65E5070CEC5F3FEC2CEA8954F4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June</a>, but that lead shrunk to 56 percent to 22 percent <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/10_4_2022_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=4BD88F8A9A453DD5901885959737AFB0274433BF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in September</a> (17 percent were undecided). This could be because Republican outside groups have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/outside-allies-help-republican-us-senate-candidates-close-gap-with-democrats-2022-10-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent at least $20 million</a> in recent weeks on attack ads against Fetterman, focusing in particular on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/us/politics/fetterman-oz-crime-justice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue of crime</a> and a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/oz-backers-launch-ads-attacking-fetterman-pulling-gun-black-jogger-201-rcna46479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 incident</a> in which Fetterman <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/who-is-john-fetterman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled a shotgun on a Black jogger</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pennsylvania isn’t the only Senate race that has gotten better for Republicans in the past couple of weeks, though: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a> look better for the GOP as well. As a result, Democrats’ <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chances of keeping control of the Senate</a>, which was steadily rising since July, has leveled off and even dipped, from a high of 71 in 100 on Sept. 20 to 67 in 100 today. To be sure, Democrats are still favorites to win Pennsylvania’s Senate seat and the Senate overall. But if Republicans are looking for reasons for optimism, they’re starting to become visible.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">While Hurricane Ian is primarily a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/03/hurricane-ian-live-updates-death-toll-flooding/8163926001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/09/30/hurricane-ian-historical-ranking-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meteorological</a> story, it is also a political story. Ian is the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Gov. Ron DeSantis was elected in 2018.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, since then, Florida has been hit by a few &lt;a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/uststorms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tropical storms&lt;/a&gt;, tropical cyclones that are weaker than hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> As a result, it has the potential to be a defining moment for his governorship. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s significant because DeSantis is up for reelection in a month and because he’s rumored to have presidential aspirations in 2024. If Floridians — and Americans — approve of his handling of the storm recovery, it could give him a strong story of leadership to tell on the campaign trail. But if he is seen as bungling the response, it could also imperil his political future. So the question is, will DeSantis’s response to Hurricane Ian boost his political career or derail it?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s too early to answer that question, but historically, governors in DeSantis’s shoes have been met with inconsistent political fates. I looked back at the states hit hardest by the 19 tropical cyclones that caused <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events/US/2000-2022?disasters%5B%5D=tropical-cyclone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $10 billion</a><a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In estimated CPI-adjusted costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> in damage in the U.S. this century and how their governors’ polling numbers changed after the storms. And while the average governor’s approval rating did increase after the storms, most of the time, those increases were minor. (Important caveat: It’s impossible to know whether the storms directly <em>caused</em> those numbers to move; other important events may have affected public opinion during that time, too.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A few governors became significantly more popular after conducting an emergency response to a storm hitting their state. For example, then-Gov. Chris Christie burnished his image by engaging in <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2012/10/obama-christie-unite-for-sandy-damage-tour-083123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan work</a> with then-President Barack Obama after the storm formerly known as<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few hours before landfall, Sandy became a post-tropical cyclone, meaning it could no longer meteorologically be classified as a hurricane. It remained hurricane-strength, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey in 2012. According to polling that year from <a href="http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2012/goodnumbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairleigh Dickinson University</a>, Christie’s approval rating among registered voters increased from 56 percent before the storm to 77 percent after. And according to Quinnipiac University, then-Gov. Jeb Bush saw his approval rating spike from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release-Legacy?releaseid=313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent</a> to <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release-Legacy?releaseid=405" target="_blank" rel="noopener">62 percent</a> after hurricanes Charley and Frances hit Florida. They made landfall in the state less than a month apart in 2004, and 87 percent of Florida voters approved of Bush’s recovery efforts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But most of the time, storms didn’t seem to change many people’s opinions about their governors — even when they thought their governor did a good job with disaster response. For example, look at North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper after Hurricane Florence in 2018. While 84 percent of registered voters told <a href="https://climatenexus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NC-Poll-Results-10_3_18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Nexus</a> that Cooper’s response to Florence was “good” or “very good,” SurveyUSA found that his approval rating increased from <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=c23131ad-7e15-4068-9655-df1486ef9b7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">49 percent</a> less than five months before the storm to <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=1a828769-6d10-465f-b9ea-1d8169a5210b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53 percent</a> a couple of weeks after it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The electoral track record is also mixed for governors who were running for reelection when a hurricane struck their state (the position DeSantis is in now). For example, in October 2016, <a href="https://www.nccivitas.org/2016/civitas-poll-voters-approve-mccrorys-hurricane-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71 percent</a> of likely North Carolina voters were satisfied with then-Gov. Pat McCrory’s response to Hurricane Matthew. And McCrory appeared to get a bump in <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/governor/nc/north_carolina_governor_mccrory_vs_cooper-4096.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head-to-head polls</a> against Cooper, his Democratic opponent. But that bump was short-lived, and McCrory lost reelection a few weeks later. And, in October 2018, <a href="http://stpetepolls.org/files/StPetePolls_2018_State_GEN_GovSenate_October16_H72F.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61 percent</a> of likely Florida voters approved of how then-Gov. Rick Scott handled the response to Hurricane Michael. But the term-limited Scott fell further behind in his race for U.S. Senate: According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, his chance of winning went from 41 in 100 on the day Michael hit to 32 in 100 two weeks later. But then, surprisingly, Scott won the race in an upset.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So if history is any guide, Hurricane Ian may not significantly affect DeSantis’s approval rating (which, as of August, was an even 50 percent, per the <a href="https://www.unf.edu/uploadedFiles/aa/coas/porl/UNF%20PORL%20August%20Survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Florida</a>) or his chances of winning reelection (which, as of Sept. 28, were 93 in 100, per the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>). But a lot depends on how DeSantis handles the storm’s aftermath. It turns out that voters are pretty rational: <a href="https://andrewreeves.org/papers/rain.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political scientists</a> who have studied this topic have found that voters <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/myopic-voters-and-natural-disaster-policy/039708A3223EC114365ADF56F1D26423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reward incumbents</a> for proactive disaster responses (e.g., delivering relief funds) and <a href="https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/QJPS-9057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punish them</a> for inadequate ones (e.g., not issuing a disaster declaration).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We see this in the real world, too. The governors who became more unpopular after their hurricanes were often those whose responses were the most ineffectual. For example, former Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna9613133#.XoJQ1C3MyLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely criticized</a> for her response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, particularly for waiting too long to order an evacuation and request federal troops for assistance. The state’s recovery from the storm was also <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0605726103" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow</a> and <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/when-half-citys-residents-may-be-homeless-new-orleans-after-katrina/2009-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">painful</a>, and Blanco’s approval rating (per <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollTrack.aspx?g=d971a8e9-e110-4e0f-accb-fffae1b75050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyUSA</a>) fell from 50 percent a couple weeks before the storm to 41 percent a couple weeks after  — and it continued to decline in subsequent months, all the way to 33 percent in December. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The story was similar in Puerto Rico. Six months after Hurricane Maria, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/374880879/La-Encuesta-de-El-Nuevo-Dia-de-marzo-de-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 percent</a> of Puerto Ricans rated Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s response to the hurricane as “good” or “very good,” and his approval rating was about the same as it had been three months before the storm. But as infrastructure remained unrepaired and power outages lingered, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/09/12/feature/residents-see-a-failure-at-all-levels-of-government/?utm_term=.3d2b936de353" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different poll</a> conducted a few months later gave him more mediocre reviews: Only 31 percent rated his response to Maria as “excellent,” “very good,” or “good.” And a year after that, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/19/why-puerto-rico-is-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosselló resigned</a> amid protests sparked by his offensive Telegram messages (some about Maria victims) and primed by general discontent with his administration.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it’s possible that DeSantis’s disaster response could significantly affect his popularity. However, there is also one big reason to think it will not: Public opinion of him is already very baked in. Per that UNF poll, 45 percent of likely voters strongly approved of DeSantis, and 41 percent strongly disapproved; only 5 percent somewhat approved, and only 7 percent somewhat disapproved. In other words, it appears that DeSantis’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/02/florida-gov-ron-desantis-chastises-students-masks-middleton-usf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pugnacious style</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/28/desantis-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embrace of the culture wars</a> has left few Floridians willing to change their minds about him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-politics-of-disasters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political-science research</a> has found that partisanship affects how people perceive politicians in the wake of natural disasters — which could explain why their polling numbers usually don’t change much. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381607080097" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study</a> found that people are more likely to blame politicians of the opposite party when governments flub hurricane-recovery efforts. If this happens in Florida, maybe Democrats will blame DeSantis, but Republicans will not and could instead take out their frustration on President Biden. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/29/how-many-votes-could-hurricane-harvey-cost-trump-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another study</a> found that voters of the incumbent’s party tend to reward that incumbent after natural disasters, while voters of the opposite party tend to punish them. In other words, the natural disaster just confirmed the voters’ partisan biases. It’s not hard to imagine the same thing happening with DeSantis.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">For Democrats, North Carolina has recently been more of a white whale than a bird in hand. No Democrat has won a statewide federal race there since 2008, when former President Barack Obama narrowly <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=37&amp;year=2008&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the state</a> by less than 1 percentage point, and the late Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=37&amp;year=2008&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried the state by a little over 8 points</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s not like North Carolina is a solidly red state. It has a partisan lean of R+4.8, putting it in the company of other swing states with competitive Senate races like Wisconsin and Nevada. Since 2008, Democrats have been successful at the statewide level, with wins in both the <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/North_Carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s</a> and <a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2020/11/17/josh-stein-wins-re-election-attorney-general-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general’s</a> races in 2016 and 2020. But despite some incredibly close, single-digit margins in U.S. Senate races in both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/north-carolina-senate-burr-ross" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/cal-cunningham-concedes-to-senator-thom-tillis-in-north-carolina.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a>, Tar Heel Democrats haven’t been able to break through since Hagan’s win in 2008.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hagan &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/north-carolina-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lost her reelection bid&lt;/a&gt; to Republican Sen. Thom Tillis in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> In other words, futile efforts to recreate the magic of 2008 in North Carolina — at least in presidential and U.S. Senate races — <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/North_Carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have consistently fallen flat</a>. And although this year’s Senate race could be the leap Democrats are hoping for, it’s likely, at least according to our metrics, to be another disappointment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s midterm election forecast</a>, Republican Rep. Ted Budd currently has around a 2-in-3 chance of beating Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former chief justice of the state Supreme Court, to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Oct. 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> That doesn’t mean the race is a done deal: Our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> shows a much more competitive race, with the most recent surveys showing the two candidates neck and neck.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the idea that the race could be close shouldn’t comfort Democrats too much. North Carolina is no stranger to close Senate matchups. In fact, in the past three Senate elections, the Democratic candidate has never lost by more than 6 percentage points. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">So given Democrats’ struggles to win federal races in the state, let’s run through a couple reasons why Beasley could be the first federal candidate in almost 15 years to win a statewide race — and why she could be yet another Democrat to narrowly lose a Senate race in North Carolina. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For starters, Beasley, who already has experience <a href="https://www.wunc.org/politics/2014-11-25/justice-cheri-beasley-unofficially-wins-re-count-in-race-for-nc-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running and winning a statewide race</a> in North Carolina, has so far maintained a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/NC/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant financial edge</a> over Budd. Her impressive fundraising skills have allowed her to spend over $10 million on TV ads, according to <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/senate/race/231026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cook Political Report</a>, which cited data from AdImpact. That’s in contrast to nearly $2 million from Budd, according to the outlet. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beasley is also hoping that the state’s demographics will work in her favor. She <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2022/9/22/23366566/cheri-beasley-inspiring-voters-north-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t been shy in admitting</a> that she hopes she can gin up support among Black voters, who make up <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/NC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 22 percent</a> of the citizen voting-age population. And if Beasley wins, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2022/09/21/black-voters-will-play-an-outsize-role-key-southern-senate-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she’d become</a> the state’s first Black U.S. senator. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The Democratic Party has been trying hard to put forward candidates who reflect the diversity of the country,” said <a href="https://www.meredith.edu/directory/whitney-manzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitney Manzo</a>, a professor of political science at North Carolina’s Meredith College. “And I think the party is banking on [Beasley] appealing to voters of color, with the hope that she will energize voters in the same way that Barack Obama did in 2008.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The increased salience of abortion access following the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might also give Beasley a lift</a> — something that other Democrats in competitive states are similarly hoping for.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe loading="lazy" title="Abortion Access In North Carolina Might Hinge On 5 Seats In The State Legislature | FiveThirtyEight" width="712" height="401" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VMDcqCEswU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In a September <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/north-carolina-2022-three-point-race-for-us-senate-overturning-of-roe-v-wade-makes-majority-more-likely-to-vote-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College</a> poll of likely North Carolina voters, 59 percent of respondents said they were much <em>more</em> likely to vote in the 2022 elections due to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Twelve percent of respondents also said that abortion was their No. 1 issue heading into the midterm elections — a figured dwarfed by the 41 percent who identified the economy as their key issue. Still, considering the tightening race between Beasley and Budd, abortion access alone might be enough to give the Democrat a significant edge at the polls. Beasley, for her part, <a href="https://www.wunc.org/politics/2022-09-23/budd-embraces-trump-abortion-opposition-nc-senate-race-2022-beasley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has repeatedly contrasted</a> her and Budd’s views on abortion access to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/cheri-beasley-politicians-step-abortion-031849882.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobilize her base</a>. Manzo added that abortion rights in particular could help Beasley woo Republican women — particularly those living in the state’s cities and large metros — who weren’t in favor of the Supreme Court’s decision.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But there are arguably more factors working <em>against</em> the Democrat. For one, even though Budd has trailed Beasley in fundraising, he’s received <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NCS2&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an onslaught of outside help</a> that Beasley just hasn’t seen so far. <a href="https://twitter.com/cheribeasleync/status/1567549455930359809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earlier this month</a>, the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, began running ads against Beasley <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00571703/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that are said to total</a> $16 million. Meanwhile, the equivalent Democratic spending arm, helmed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, <a href="https://www.wral.com/democratic-group-spends-1-3m-to-help-beasley-in-nc/20296625/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t spent nearly</a> as much on Beasley. <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00484642/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent estimates show</a> that the Democratic Senate PAC has spent a little under $2 million supporting Beasley and another $2.7 million opposing Budd. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This Senate race has kind of been a sleeper or second-tier kind of a race. It feels like North Carolina and Florida have taken a backseat to Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio and Wisconsin,” said <a href="https://catawba.edu/michael-bitzer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Bitzer</a>, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College, which is also located in North Carolina. “To me, it seems like Beasley is doing everything she needs to do to be competitive and potentially win. But without a financial investment from the Democratic Party, I’m not sure that she’s going to make it across the finish line.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The high number of unaffiliated voters in North Carolina could also work against the Democrat. According to a 2022 study by the <a href="https://www.ncdemography.org/2022/05/09/unaffiliated-voter-shifts-in-nc-and-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, over 2.4 million of the state’s registered voters (about two-thirds of the electorate) are not affiliated with either major political party. According to Manzo, these voters <em>do </em>tend to fall somewhere between Republicans and Democrats, but <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bliss/docs/State-of-the-Parties-2021/bitzer-cooper-manzo-roberts-sop21-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veer slightly more conservative</a>. “I would not see the unaffiliated population of North Carolina as a giant pool of potential support for Cheri Beasley,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">North Carolina has also seen an increase in its nonwhite population from 2000 through 2018, according to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2020/09/23/the-changing-racial-and-ethnic-composition-of-the-u-s-electorate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>. In 2018, 31 percent of North Carolina’s eligible voters were nonwhite — an increase of 6 percentage points over the course of almost two decades.<strong> </strong>While, in theory, this trend <em>should</em> boost Democrats, who tend to do better with nonwhite voters, demographics are not destiny in American politics, and it’s not clear that Democrats are making inroads with these groups. In 2020, more Hispanic voters in North Carolina <a href="https://hispanicvote.univision.com/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were registered</a> as independent/other (89,958) than Democrats (85,538) or Republicans (43,126). Asian American voters in the state <a href="https://ncaatogether.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-ncaat-demographic-report-online-11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are largely unaffiliated</a>, too, but lean Democratic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, of course, while North Carolina does have a large Black voting-age population, there hasn’t been a concerted effort to get these voters to the polls, according to Bitzer. “In Georgia, you saw very focused and intentional registration and mobilization efforts helmed by Stacey Abrams,” he said. “But nobody’s really done something equivalent in North Carolina. Some groups have been trying, but there hasn’t been that real long-term investment and focus that I think differentiates North Carolina from Georgia.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, white voters are even harder for Democrats to win. While exit polls in recent elections suggest that white voters in North Carolina are somewhat less firmly in the GOP camp than in, say, Georgia, they still lean quite Republican. In 2016, former President Donald Trump won 63 percent of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/nc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white voters in North Carolina</a> compared with Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 32 percent. That same year <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Georgia</a>, however, he won white voters by a much larger margin: 75 percent to 21 percent. In the last presidential election, however, President Biden narrowly improved on Clinton’s margin among white voters in Georgia (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 percent to Trump’s 69 percent</a>), but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/north-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t improve much</a> in North Carolina, only winning 33 percent of the state’s white voters compared to Trump’s 66 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plus, North Carolina has a large number of voters who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/fight-evangelical-voters-could-be-crucial-north-carolina-n1245746" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are evangelical Protestants</a>, who are both <a href="https://wthh.dataforprogress.org/blog/2018/11/5/understanding-white-evangelicals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to both vote Republican</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-big-chunk-of-white-americans-with-degrees-and-people-of-color-are-behind-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have conservative attitudes</a> toward certain racial issues. According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/north-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exit poll data from CNN</a>, about one-third (35 percent) of North Carolina’s voters identified as born-again or evangelical Christians in 2020. Of that number, 86 percent backed Trump, compared with 14 percent who supported Biden. “Particularly in rural North Carolina and in the surrounding suburban counties, they make up a core constituency of the base of the Republican Party in the state,” Bitzer said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, lastly, similar to other Democrats in competitive races this fall, Biden’s low approval ratings could drag down Beasley. According to a September <a href="https://www.highpoint.edu/blog/2022/09/hpu-poll-presidential-approval-at-34-governor-approval-at-44-in-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">High Point University</a> poll, only 34 percent of North Carolinians said they approved of Biden’s job performance as president. More than half of surveyed residents (53 percent) said they disapprove of the job Biden is doing. (It’s worth noting, though, that Beasley did run about <a href="https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/03/2020&amp;county_id=0&amp;office=FED&amp;contest=1373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.4 points ahead of Biden</a> in 2020, when she lost reelection as Supreme Court Chief Justice <a href="https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/03/2020&amp;county_id=0&amp;office=JUD&amp;contest=1375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 401 total votes</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the end, we still expect this race to be a close one given past Senate margins in North Carolina, and the fact that Beasley is a fairly strong candidate. That September Emerson College survey found Budd and Beasley practically neck and neck in terms of their favorability numbers: Forty-eight percent of voters in North Carolina had a favorable view of the Republican compared with 46 percent who felt the same way about Beasley. Their unfavorability numbers were about the same, too: Thirty-eight percent viewed Budd unfavorably versus 40 percent for Beasley. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So all hope isn’t lost for Beasley. Since Democrats’ dreams of winning a North Carolina Senate race since 2008 has been a sort of pipe dream, it’s unclear whether she can pull through. But the possibility is still there. “In this state, anything could happen,” Bitzer told me. “So who knows?”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday night, The Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-life-herschel-walker-paid-for-girlfriends-abortion-georgia-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia who has said he wants to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/herschel-walker-supports-total-abortion-ban-no-exception-georgia-senate-2022-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban abortion in all circumstances</a>, had paid for his pregnant then-girlfriend to get an abortion in 2009.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Walker is currently locked in a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toss-up race</a> with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock for a seat that could decide control of the Senate. According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s midterm forecast</a>, Georgia is the most likely “tipping-point” state in the chamber — i.e., the state most likely to give Republicans or Democrats their majority. To give you a sense of how crucial it is: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If Republicans win Georgia</a>, we estimate they would have a 60-in-100 chance of winning the Senate. But if Democrats win the state, we estimate they’d have an 89-in-100 chance of winning the chamber.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The question is, how much will this controversy hurt Walker? Given the salaciousness of the story and the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/herschel-walker-pledges-to-sue-over-abortion-claim/RLTO2CSSMJDS3MPG3SZEZLQAMM/?p" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turmoil it has reportedly plunged his campaign into</a>, it’s tempting to think it might torpedo his chances. But that’s hardly a guarantee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It is true that scandals tangibly affect candidates’ chances of winning elections. I keep a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ksBLxRR3GCZd33IvhkcNqqBd5K8HwlWC7YuAkVmS1lg/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database of scandals</a>, and based on an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-scandals-hurt-candidates-running-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis we did in 2018</a>, we found that scandal-plagued incumbents did 9 percentage points worse in their next general election than they would otherwise be projected to do. That analysis included a variety of factors such as the candidate’s previous margin of victory, the partisan lean of their district, generic-ballot polling, congressional approval ratings and the incumbent’s congressional voting record. This finding led us to include whether or not a candidate faces a scandal as a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">variable in our midterm forecast</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this new revelation about Walker, who has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-gop-senate-herschel-walker-denies-report-paid-girlfriends-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied the allegation</a>, hasn’t affected our forecast of the Georgia Senate race — at least not yet. That’s because, for one, it doesn’t meet <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-heres-how-we-decide-whos-involved-in-a-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our definition of a scandal</a>. As our forecast defines it, a scandal is a credible accusation of objective criminal or ethical wrongdoing. While Walker’s decision to pay for an abortion may have been hypocritical, it wasn’t illegal. And if being hypocritical were enough to qualify as “scandal-tarred,” most politicians would be slapped with the label!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, Walker has already been tagged with the scandal variable. Before and during his campaign, multiple previous scandals that meet our definition have come out. Walker’s ex-wife accused him of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatening to kill her</a> and was granted a protective order against him in 2005. He and a business partner were sued after <a href="https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/state/georgia/article258250315.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failing to repay $625,000 in loans</a>. Democrats have <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/complaint-herschel-walker-violated-campaign-law/85-fcab4a1a-fa19-4182-98c4-f5f249be01a1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused him</a> of multiple <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/georgia-democrats-accuse-walker-of-violating-campaign-finance-rules/FVWKQ6WJQJDPZE3ICEYJTHDBKM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign-finance violations</a>. And in June, The Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-says-hes-a-model-dad-he-has-a-secret-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Walker had fathered <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-critic-of-absentee-dads-admits-to-yet-another-secret-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three children</a> he had not previously publicly acknowledged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But right now, the scandal variable barely impacts our forecast. Only 6 percent of the Deluxe forecast for Georgia Senate is based on the “fundamentals,” which include variables like scandals, Georgia’s partisan lean, Warnock’s incumbency and candidate fundraising. That’s because Georgia is a very heavily polled state. And because we have so many polls and it is relatively close to Election Day, almost 60 percent of the forecast is based on survey data.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, of course, because this story is so recent, none of these polls account for Walker’s abortion controversy. The bad press Walker is receiving may very well damage his standing with voters. The story has already spurred Walker’s adult son Christian, a conservative social-media celebrity, to post critical <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianWalk1r/status/1577101530586484736?s=20&amp;t=7p_NJCrYU-fTaiGalNb69Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweets</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianWalk1r/status/1577284445367042049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a> about the candidate (including one in which he accused Walker of “<a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianWalk1r/status/1577104266543497216?s=20&amp;t=7p_NJCrYU-fTaiGalNb69Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatening to kill us</a>”), which could keep Walker’s unsavory personal life in the news. And he doesn’t need to drop 9 points in the polls for this all to have an impact: According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average of the race</a>, Warnock is currently polling 2 points ahead of Walker, so even if the controversy doesn’t <em>hurt</em> Walker, if it prevents him from <em>gaining</em>, that’s a problem for the Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But on the other hand, there might not be many voters left to turn on Walker. Democrats have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbhqF21eyhg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">airing ads</a> <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-whats-at-stake-in-the-warnock-walker-debate/HWZOLTPWIZBXDOGBCBGBSWSDDM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for weeks</a> reminding voters of Walker’s past scandals. And Georgia is also a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly inelastic state</a>, meaning it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t have a lot of swing voters</a>. The National Republican Senatorial Committee <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshKraushaar/status/1577135306402168833?s=20&amp;t=xM87JheBzBY9QzNNqhBXQQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also said</a> it will continue campaigning hard in Georgia. Many Republican and Republican-leaning voters in Georgia may feel that too much is at stake (i.e., control of the Senate) for this latest allegation to sway their vote. And, as we wrote in 2018, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisanship-often-trumps-scandal-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisanship often trumps scandal</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As always, we’ll need to wait and see to know for sure how public opinion will change in response to this story. You can bet that we’ll keep an extra close eye on Georgia polling for the next few weeks.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In most midterm years, young voters tend to sit out the election. But 2022 could be a different kind of year. Turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds <a href="https://about.bgov.com/brief/election-demographics-and-voter-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly doubled between the 2014 and 2018 midterm cycles</a>. And the Supreme Court’s June ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which allows states to ban abortion for the first time in nearly five decades, suddenly put a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-have-swung-toward-democrats-since-the-dobbs-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotlight on reproductive-health issues</a> in many key elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could motivate the country’s youngest voters — particularly women — to turn out in higher numbers. A <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/gender-generation-and-abortion-shifting-politics-and-perspectives-after-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large, recently released survey</a> from the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life shows that women between age 18 and 29 are especially likely to say not only that they’re following news about abortion rights and access closely but also that abortion is a critical issue for them.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AEI’s American Perspectives Survey was conducted Aug. 12-21 among a random sample of 5,049 U.S. adults using the &lt;a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ipsos KnowledgePanel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> They’re also more likely than young men to say that they’re single-issue voters on abortion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even though young women appear to be following politics more closely than they were before the Dobbs decision, it may be harder for Democrats to mobilize them now than it was even a month or two ago. Since the summer, abortion appears to have become a less prominent issue. Data from the ongoing <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey</a> using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a> indicates that the share of Americans who say they have heard a lot about abortion in the news declined from August to September.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all five waves of our ongoing panel survey conducted between April and September, respondents were asked whether they had seen a lot of coverage of the 20 major issues we asked about in the past month, including “other” and “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> And probably not unrelatedly, the share of Americans who say that abortion is one of the most important issues facing the country fell over that period as well, after peaking in July.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all five waves of our ongoing panel survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write which issue or issues were most important to them, and two multiple-choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20 (including “other” or “none of these”) that they were personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. The sample is weighted to match the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Experts told me, though, that young women’s reaction to living in a country with increasingly limited abortion access might take a while to take shape. Because fewer young voters usually turn out in <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/2018-youth-voter-turnout-increased-every-state#arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">midterm elections</a> than in <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/our-research/broadening-youth-voting#youth-voting-in-recent-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential elections</a>, we may not feel the full impact of Dobbs among this group right away — particularly if Republicans succeed in restricting abortion in purple states like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/will-abortion-stay-legal-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/abortion-access-in-north-carolina-might-hinge-on-5-seats-in-the-state-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/youngkins-office-says-no-plans-for-abortion-bill-at-special-session-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia</a> in upcoming legislative sessions. So this year’s elections represent the first test of how young women are responding to the Supreme Court’s decision and its aftermath.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, women and men don’t tend to think about abortion very differently — with the exception of the youngest generation of women. According to the Survey Center on American Life’s American Perspectives Survey, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of women between 18 and 29 think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 56 percent of men in the same age group and 52 percent of women 65 or over. The “most” versus “all” distinction is important because smaller shares tend to think that abortion should always be legal, with no limitations at all. But nearly half (48 percent) of 18- to 29-year-old women think abortion should be legal in <em>all</em> circumstances, compared with only 34 percent of both 18- to 29-year-old men and women 65 or over. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And young women have been paying attention to the news, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 states have successfully banned nearly all abortions</a> over the past few months. Sixty-four percent of 18- to 29-year-old women say they’re following news about abortion laws and restrictions very or somewhat closely — more than the share who say they’re closely following news about gas prices and inflation (55 percent) or the 2022 midterm elections (25 percent). Young women are also much likelier than Americans as a whole to say that abortion is a critical issue for them personally, by 61 percent to 36 percent. That’s true compared with other women, too: Only 34 percent of women 65 or over say that abortion is a critical issue for them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Young women are much likelier to say abortion is a critical issue" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aAByO/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="386" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The survey raises an intriguing possibility: that young women are likelier than their older counterparts to see the Supreme Court’s ruling, and the ensuing scramble to ban abortion in red states, as an attack on <em>all</em> women and not just a new set of restrictions on a medical procedure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The researchers asked a set of questions designed to gauge whether people think of themselves as part of a distinct group, where things that happen to other people like them matter for them as well. The findings suggest that women who believe that what happens to other women in the U.S. affects their lives too were far likelier than women who don’t feel those connections to support abortion rights. Young women, meanwhile, were especially likely to feel a sense of linked fate with other women. About two-thirds (67 percent) of 18- to 29-year-old women said that everything or most things that happen to other women affected them too, compared with only 36 percent of women 65 or over. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young women seem to feel a more acute sense of discrimination in general. The vast majority (82 percent) of women 65 or over say that people don’t treat them any differently because of their gender, whereas a much smaller majority (54 percent) of young women say the same. And 39 percent of young women say they think people treat them worse because of their gender.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, young women might be more likely than other demographic groups to feel that their own lives could be affected by abortion bans. Of course, women between 18 and 29 do make up <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-abortion-has-changed-since-1973/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large share of women</a> who get abortions, but the number of abortions performed in the U.S. every year is relatively small — suggesting that this sense of shared consequences could make this issue feel especially personal for young women, particularly in the short term. “I could imagine a woman in her 20s looking at the cost of child care, the difficulty of being a parent, and thinking, ‘Being able to get an abortion is something that really matters for women,’” said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University-Camden and the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bad news for Democrats is that there are signs that abortion may be fading as a priority, even for younger women. The American Perspectives Survey was conducted in August, but it’s possible that if the same questions were asked today, enthusiasm around the issue of abortion might be lower. According to the ongoing FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll, shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling, 29 percent of reproductive-aged women (ages 18-44) said that abortion was one of the top three issues facing the country — a substantially higher share than women 45 or over (18 percent), men between 18 and 44 (18 percent), and men 45 or over (12 percent).<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on five waves of a 2022 FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos panel survey drawn from a sample of up to 2,006 adults. Each sample was weighted to match the general population. Respondents could select up to three issues from a list of 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> But since then, the issue has lost some steam. Even among reproductive-aged women, only 12 percent listed abortion as one of their highest priorities in the most recent wave of the survey, conducted Sept. 6-19.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Abortion isn't as high a priority for some younger women" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Aqq03/12/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="368" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">That trend probably has something to do with Americans’ hearing less about abortion in the news now than in the summer. The FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey found that the share of reproductive-aged women who said they’d heard a lot about abortion in the news dropped from 70 percent just after the Dobbs ruling to 47 percent in September. So a lot could depend on whether stories about people who can’t get abortions even in dire circumstances — like the <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2022/07/14/what-know-10-year-old-rape-survivor-and-columbus-man-arrested-indiana-abortion/10057679002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-year-old rape survivor who had to travel</a> from Ohio to Indiana for an abortion in July — make their way back into the headlines over the coming month. And then there’s the fact that only 25 percent of young women in the American Perspectives Survey said they were following news about the midterm elections very closely, suggesting that their concern about abortion rights may not translate into enthusiasm to vote in the upcoming elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Mary-Kate Lizotte, an Augusta University political scientist who studies women’s political participation, said that the abrupt restrictions on abortion access could end up being a generation-defining event, even if young women don’t dramatically reshape the outcome of the midterms. After all, only a handful of races will determine which party controls Congress — not all of them statewide — and these <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/24/voter-turnout-always-drops-off-for-midterm-elections-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elections generally get less attention</a> than in presidential years. Whether or not the issue brings a lot of young women to the polls in key races, she said, the Supreme Court’s decision and the bans that followed are likely to shape young women’s views of the GOP for years to come, solidifying their antipathy to the party as they grow older and start voting more regularly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“For a lot of voters, particularly young women who are going to be impacted in a very real way, this is going to be one of the first times that they really cared about something when it comes to politics,” said Lizotte. “That’s going to anchor the way many [young women] view the parties — not just in 2022, but in 2024 and beyond.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Oct. 5, 2022, 11:05 a.m.):</strong> This article has been updated to explain the methodology and question wording used in the ongoing FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos panel survey.

<p data-paragraph="main">It was one of the big puzzles of the 2020 election: Why did Latino voters — who <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/389093/hispanic-americans-party-updated-analysis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically lean Democratic</a> — <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23277397/latino-voters-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swing toward former President Donald Trump</a>? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Was it his <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-white-house-hispanic-prosperity-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise of economic prosperity</a> for Latino Americans? After all, the No. 1 issue for Hispanic registered voters — like the broader electorate — that year was <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/11/hispanic-voters-say-economy-health-care-and-covid-19-are-top-issues-in-2020-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy</a>, according to the Pew Research Center. Or could it have been his <a href="https://time.com/5928808/trump-border-wall-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledge to construct a border wall</a> and enforce a type of “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/17/to-understand-donald-trumps-law-and-order-appeal-look-south-of-the-border/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law and order</a>” along the U.S.-Mexico border, which might have appealed to <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/democrats-losing-texas-latinos-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain Southern voters, particularly those in Texas?</a> It’s still not entirely clear.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The upcoming midterm elections will test the durability of Republican gains — and Democratic losses — among this key group. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/-clock-ticking-democrats-defense-republicans-pursue-latino-voters-rcna16745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Both parties</a> are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/15/democrats-ramp-up-efforts-win-over-hispanic-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubling down on their efforts</a> to appeal to Latino Americans. But perhaps the most important lesson from 2020 was that Latino voters — the country’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23277397/latino-voters-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest-growing voting bloc</a> — can’t be painted with a broad brush. “We’re a growing percentage of the population, and, over time, we’ve become even more important to the parties,” said Georgiana Hernandez, 66, of New Mexico. “But I don’t see Latinos as monolithic. And in tight races, any movement you can get among the racial groups is important. It all comes down to being attuned to our needs and appealing to issues that are important to people of different stripes.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, I wanted to see what was on the minds of five Latino voters in the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections. Unsurprisingly, and as the chart below illustrates, a range of policies are top of mind for Latino voters when it comes to deciding who they’ll cast a ballot for. </p>

 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">While, like for all Americans, economic issues like inflation and cost of living are still Latino voters’ No. 1 concern, according a recent NALEO poll, abortion rights and health care were also top of mind for a number of surveyed respondents. (This range of priorities was reflected in my interviews, too.)  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But when it comes to the top issue on the minds of Latino Americans, neither party has a clear advantage. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/poll-abortion-trump-boost-midterm-prospects-democrats-rcna48173" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As the chart below suggests</a>, respondents are almost evenly split on which party they trust more on economic issues. They tend to favor Democrats over Republicans, however, on other issues, like immigration and gun policy, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-gops-grievance-politics-might-not-turn-off-conservative-latino-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my reporting also suggests</a> that many Latinos are more socially conservative, which could be a problem for Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Latino voters agree more with Democrats on some issues" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r2RDK/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="365" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, this is why polling on Latino voters is often so hard to gauge — like all voters, they hold different, often competing, priorities. And in speaking to these five people, I wanted to get a better grip on these complexities as we move closer to Election Day. I learned that these Latino voters want the parties to treat them as a complex, multifaceted voting bloc — and they’re aware of the power they wield. As Hernandez told me: “Latinos can really swing things one way or the other, so it’s no surprise to me that our votes are considered competitive.”</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: What are the most important issues to you heading into the midterm elections?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Carlos Ruiz (58, Arizona, Republican): The economy and inflation are the most important issues to me, but I’m also prioritizing the lack of control on the border. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Alicia Bejarano (19, South Carolina, Libertarian): This year, I’m going to be looking closely at what candidates have to say about gun reform and their reaction to the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade. I’m also interested in issues related to policing and police accountability. I don’t know whether I have strong feelings about the police being defunded, but, at least currently, I feel like law enforcement isn’t capable of de-escalating situations in a way that doesn’t lead to more violence or death. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jaime Vasquez (20, Texas, Republican): My top concern right now is making sure that Americans get to keep our natural rights as they’re recognized in the Constitution. It’s important to realize that without the Second Amendment, there can be no First Amendment. My No. 2 issue is the economy, since I have concerns about increased government spending by the Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Diana Agapay (42, Florida, Democrat): My top issue going into the midterms is expanding abortion access and improving health care access for women. My second top issue is investigating any previous presidential administration that has done anything illegal and making sure that they go through our existing criminal justice system — as any <em>non</em>-government figure would. And the third top issue for me is probably inflation, but I think that’ll eventually calm down.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Georgiana Hernandez (66, New Mexico, Democrat): There are three: One is climate change, which I’ve been very concerned about for quite a while. The second is reproductive rights. And the third is voting rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Can you reflect a bit on your mood going into this election and whether it’s different from two years ago?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: I don’t feel any more enthusiastic for this election than I was in 2020. Two years ago, I quickly realized what the election meant — and the importance of it. Even though [Republicans] were in power at the time, the election felt like an inflection point because the race could have swung either way. And I still feel that way heading into this year’s midterm elections. We’re still at a crossroads, it seems, and there’s the same level of enthusiasm to go and vote [this year] — at least on my part.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: I’m more anxious about the midterm elections than I was for the elections in 2020. Don’t get me wrong, 2020 was very anxiety inducing, but I feel like the stakes are much higher now for Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: During the 2020 election, Latino voters moved further right. Why do you think that happened? Have you personally moved more toward Republicans since 2016; if so, why? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: I’ve been a registered Republican since I was 18 — which would’ve been around the Reagan era. But I think the economic prosperity from 2016 through 2020 was across the board and that Hispanics saw a more open, unregulated economy with lower taxes that allowed more people to either increase their wages or grow their businesses. As a result, I think people moved more toward Republicans and the political philosophy that supports that kind of economic environment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: I didn’t necessarily move right since 2016, and I can’t speak for all Latino voters, but I can speak from experience when saying this: I come from a Hispanic family, and a majority of them are Republicans. In the Hispanic community, there’s this ‘bootstrap’ ideology among people who immigrated to the United States that you have to ‘do the work’ to get here. I’ve noticed that in my family, and in talks with other Hispanic families, we have this sense of responsibility and honor. And that honor arises from the fact that we all came into this country ‘the right way.’ Then you have Republicans who are basically saying, ‘Yes, that’s exactly what we want.’ I’m personally not drawn to that bootstrap ideology, but since Republicans are the main ones saying it, I can understand why some Hispanics moved toward them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: My views are still the same as they were in 2016, but I think I’ve become more bold and open in my support for Republicans. My family and I have been a small minority in South Texas because it has been blue for decades, and we were always that one Republican family in the neighborhood that felt like our vote didn’t matter. But, in 2020, things shifted here, and my area — and the Rio Grande Valley, more broadly — swung pretty heavily toward Republicans. The fact that the politics down here changed so much in just four years was pretty shocking, to be honest. I’m not really sure what attributed to the switch, but I can make some guesses: South Texas, especially the RGV, is still very much rooted in traditional values similar to what many conservative voices in the Republican Party advocate. I also think that Democrats moving further left on social issues, particularly the ‘defund the police’ narrative, turned off voters who had families working in law enforcement or border patrol.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Agapay: I did not move toward Republicans at all. If anything, I’ve moved more left. I do have thoughts, though, on why some Latino voters may have moved toward Republicans. I’m a first-generation American, both of my parents immigrated to this country, and I believe that Latinos tend to be more conservative, especially when it comes to their faith. I also think that Republicans use fear-based messaging in their attempts to target Latino voters and, in a sense, have convinced some of us to be fearful of Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: As of today, do you lean more toward the Democratic Party, the Republican Party or neither? And what, if anything, would it take for you to support the opposing party? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: The Republican Party. But if a Republican candidate had what I would call a very fringe philosophy and a Democratic candidate was more centrist, that might cause me to vote for the Democrat. But if I had a choice between a person that had fringe philosophies on the left and fringe philosophies on the right, I’d probably just not vote in that race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: In terms of issues like gun reform, police accountability and my disapproval over the overturning of Roe — those are issues that I trust the Democrats on more. So, for the moment, you could say I have nothing against Democrats because we have a lot of the same values. That said, I’m not Democratic nor Republican: I’m a Libertarian. And in order for me to support Republicans, I’d need to see their grip on the interpretation of the Constitution loosen a bit to allow for new ideas to flourish that would better accommodate our modern society.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: Definitely Republicans. I don’t think there’s anything that Democrats and I currently see eye-to-eye on, so I’m not sure there’s anything that could convince me to vote for them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Agapay: The Democratic Party, but I could probably support a Republican candidate who’s actually going to be truthful and stand up to the nonsense that has been coming out of the Republican Party for the past six years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: Definitely the Democratic Party. I don’t see myself ever supporting a Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Why do you think Latino voters are such a coveted bloc for both major political parties?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: We are a large population but, historically, our voting propensity is not that high. And if Latino voters could be encouraged to cast their ballots more frequently, then all of a sudden both parties would look at them as a large, more competitive voting bloc as they do with other races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: As bad as it sounds, I think both parties just want to say that they have the minority vote. They see it as, ‘Oh, these are the honest and good people that worked hard to get here.’ But that alone is not sound logic and is not a good enough reason alone for them to court Latino voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: I think it has to do with the changing demographics of the country over the last two censuses. Since at least 2010, there’s been a dramatic increase in the Hispanic population. And bringing more Hispanic voters into your tent could really change the dynamics of each party’s politics — Republicans especially. There has always been this narrative that Republicans are anti-minority, and they have a big opportunity to change that if they get more Hispanic voters on their side. Meanwhile, the Democrats have always tried to tout themselves as the pro-minority party, so they probably want to maintain that talking point because they think it makes them seem, in my opinion, more morally virtuous. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Agapay: For the simple fact that we are growing in numbers. Plus, I think Latino voters finally realized that we have a voice and that we can use our voice to sway elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: How could each party better appeal to Latino voters? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: I grew up middle-class: My father was a heavy equipment operator and my mom was an office worker, but all of my siblings and I went to college and we became more successful than our parents had. That’s the American Dream, and Democrats would do a bit better if they sent a similar kind of message to Latinos that the American Dream is possible through hard work and education. And I think Republicans have improved their messaging on immigration to be less offensive, but some of the language there should be centered more on the needs of our country versus talking about specific groups of people coming in.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: They need to go to the places where we are. Whenever I hear about politicians traveling, they’re always going to Texas or California or Florida because there happen to be large swaths of Latinos living there. But, in addition, they should also go visit places like South Carolina. I certainly didn’t expect to find anyone here of my same heritage, but we <em>do </em>have a foundation; and both parties could do a better job at tapping into Latino populations in other, smaller, states. Both parties could also do a better job at talking with younger Hispanics between the ages of 19 and 25. I feel like we’re not as readily acknowledged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: I think both sides could do a better job at listening to what Latino voters are asking for, but that will differ depending on where we live. For example, Latino voters living in more rural areas may have different needs than those, say, living in large urban or suburban areas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Recent polling shows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/politics/latino-vote-polling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that the economy</a> is a top issue for Latino voters. Which party do you agree with more on economic issues, and why?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: I’m more frugal with money, which, as I understand, is more in line with the Republican Party’s way of thinking.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: I definitely agree with the conservative point of view, which takes a more laissez-faire [economic] approach, coincided with limited government spending and lower taxes on individuals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: I definitely agree more with the Democratic Party. I think that President Biden has done as much as he can do to try to lower gasoline prices, but there’s a lot that’s not in his control as far as supply chain issues go. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are there other issues where you trust one party over the other? If so, what are those issues?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: On crime, I trust the Republicans more. And even though this is more of a local issue, I think housing affordability is something that the Democrats would be a little bit better at addressing because they might be more creative with planning and zoning.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: On crime and immigration, I trust the Republican Party more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: I trust the Democratic Party to do what’s in the best interest of the American people overall. I have no faith in the Republican Party, and that’s why I’m nervous for this election — I can’t bear to think about the potential consequences if we lose both the House and Senate.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the time of this recording, 62 deaths have been recorded as a result of Hurricane Ian, and that number is expected to rise. Natural disasters — particularly hurricanes — have long shaped public perception of both politicians and climate policy. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew breaks down how the handling of Hurricane Ian could reflect on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and how climate change policy has become more popular among Americans impacted by destructive weather events.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The team is also joined by Tia Mitchell, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Washington correspondent, to discuss a listener question that goes beyond the midterm forecast model: Could President Biden really enact more of his policy agenda if just two more Democratic senators were elected?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, they analyze why Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is backing the new Electoral Count Reform Act and when the new bill will be voted on in the Senate.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The beginning of the end for the Voting Rights Act <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/magazine/voting-rights-act-dream-undone.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started more than 30 years ago</a>. On Oct. 4, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/merrill-v-milligan-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the end of the end is likely to begin</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This term, the Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether Alabama’s newly drawn congressional maps violate <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act#:~:text=Section%202%20of%20the%20Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965%20prohibits,)(2)%20of%20the%20Act." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965</a>, which prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race. In a seven-district state, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/02/in-5-4-vote-justices-reinstate-alabama-voting-map-despite-lower-courts-ruling-that-it-dilutes-black-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new maps included</a> only one majority-Black district even though the state has a population that is more than one-quarter Black. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1086/229773/20220711132550198_2022.07.11%20Milligan%20Br.%20for%20Appellees_A.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The groups challenging the maps say</a> that because it would be relatively easy to draw a map with two majority-Black districts, the state is legally obligated to do so. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1086/221827/20220425152045101_Milligan%20-%20Merits%20Br%20FINAL%204-25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">But Alabama Republicans countered</a> by arguing they don’t have a requirement to use the plaintiffs’ maps, because creating a second majority-Black district would violate other race-neutral criteria used in redistricting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The justices’ ruling could have implications that go far beyond Alabama, potentially neutering what remains of the Voting Rights Act — a seminal piece of legislation that is ostensibly permanent yet constantly imperiled. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The current Supreme Court justices, under Chief Justice John Roberts, might strike the final blow against the Voting Rights Act, whether it’s in this case or a future one. But they didn’t strike the first blow. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of Supreme Court cases involving the Voting Rights Act, most of the first 20 years of decisions interpreting the law went in a liberal direction.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used case-level data coded by researchers at the Supreme Court Database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> That changed in the late 1980s, when more right-leaning justices joined the bench and, not coincidentally, more and more of decisions overall started to go in a conservative direction. Of the seven Voting Rights Act cases that the court has heard in the Roberts era, only one had a liberal outcome. “Starting in the 1990s as the court’s composition changed, the court has been cutting back or refusing to expand Section 2 in virtually every case it’s had,” said <a href="https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&amp;personid=20200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard H. Pildes</a>, a constitutional law professor at New York University.</p>

Up until now, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1429486/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court has taken the perspective</a> that, in order to comply with the act, states are in some situations required to take race into consideration <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Thornburg_v._Gingles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the primary factor</a> in the redistricting process. Alabama Republicans <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/dangerous-alabama-voting-rights-case-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are now arguing</a> that it’s discriminatory to prioritize race over other traditional redistricting techniques, such as having compact districts, contiguous boundaries or avoiding crossing county or town boundaries. Several experts, including Pildes, told FiveThirtyEight that a ruling that sides with Alabama would be a radical departure from previous interpretations of the law and would likely free states to draw congressional or state legislative maps where minority voters have less political power relative to their numbers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In that sense, the outcome of this case could be very similar to <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2013 ruling</a> in which the Roberts court gutted another section of the Voting Rights Act, freeing a group of states with histories of discrimination against minority voters to change their election laws without federal approval. In the years afterward, those states <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-locations/southern-u-s-states-have-closed-1200-polling-places-in-recent-years-rights-group-idUSKCN1VV09J" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shuttered thousands of polling places</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X20916426?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intensified their voter purges</a> and <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/effects-shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed voting laws</a> in other ways that disproportionately affect minority voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When it was passed in 1965, two crucial sections of the Voting Rights Act — Section 2 and Section 5 — tackled the problem of race-based voter suppression. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act#:~:text=Section%205%20was%20designed%20to,applicable%20only%20to%20certain%20states." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 5 was proactive</a>, trying to stop discrimination before it occurred by requiring states with a history of discrimination to run any changes to their election laws by the federal government in a process that was known as “preclearance.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Section 2, on the other hand, was designed to handle discrimination <em>after</em> it happened. It works as an enforcement mechanism for the Fifteenth Amendment, which says that the right to vote can’t be denied or limited on the basis of race. Effectively, it gave minority voters another avenue to bring voter-suppression claims to the courts. Crucially, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/redistricting/redistricting-and-the-supreme-court-the-most-significant-cases.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that applies to the redistricting process</a> since it forbade states from drawing district lines in a way that diluted racial minorities’ votes. According to Jesse Rhodes, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who has written on the history of the Voting Rights Act, the law was designed to provide “an equal opportunity for [minority voters] to elect candidates that represent them and wield power in proportion to their numbers.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past few decades, Section 2 has primarily been used as a weapon against a practice known as racial gerrymandering — where lawmakers spread minority voters across state and federal legislative districts, or pack them into districts, in a way that made it impossible for those groups to elect the candidates of their choice. (We previously <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-gerrymandering-the-best-way-to-make-sure-black-voters-are-represented/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported on how Section 2 reshaped North Carolina</a> as part of “The Gerrymandering Project.”) In many ways, the case in Alabama is a textbook example, according to <a href="https://gould.usc.edu/faculty/?id=73521" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Franita Tolson</a>, an election law professor at the University of Southern California. “A decade ago, we would have said that this is a clear Section 2 violation,” Tolson said. “African Americans didn’t get the number of seats they were entitled to. Very straightforward.” The panel of lower court judges who heard the case earlier this year — which included two Trump appointees — <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/24/alabama-congressional-map-blocked-federal-court/9205925002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But several experts, including Tolson, told me that they don’t expect the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority to take this tack. That’s because the court has grown increasingly hostile to the Voting Rights Act over the past few decades. The timing is not a coincidence. Roberts, who has been chief justice since 2005, <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/john-roberts-voting-rights-act-121222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been critical of the law</a> — and Section 2 — since he was a young government lawyer in the 1980s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it goes beyond Roberts. In February, five of the conservatives <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/21a375.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to restore</a> Alabama’s congressional map — the one with only one majority-Black district — for the 2022 election after the map had been overturned by the lower-court panel. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a375_d18f.pdf#page=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roberts dissented</a>, saying that the lower-court judges had applied the law correctly. But he added that the Supreme Court’s previous cases “have engendered considerable disagreement and uncertainty regarding the nature and contours of a vote dilution claim,” suggesting that he may be open to rethinking the scope of Section 2.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since Roberts was sworn in, the Supreme Court has ruled on seven cases involving the Voting Rights Act, according to our analysis of data from the Supreme Court Database. In five of those cases, the ruling went in a conservative direction. <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/05-204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One of the other cases</a> was a complex opinion where the median justice, Anthony Kennedy, joined the court’s liberals to overturn one congressional district in Texas, saying that it had unconstitutionally diluted Latinos’ votes. In the other “liberal” outcome, the court ruled <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/northwest-austin-municipal-utility-district-number-one-v-eric-holder-jr-attorney-general-et-al/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a 2008 case involving a Texas utility district</a> that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act wasn’t unconstitutional. Five years later, it eviscerated the preclearance requirement in another case, Shelby County v. Holder. That 2013 ruling didn’t invalidate Section 5 altogether, but it did reject the formula that Congress used to determine which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, saying that it relied on outdated data.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A ruling in favor of Alabama in this case would have a different — but still significant — impact. In the short-term, it would mean that there are fewer majority Black districts in Alabama and Louisiana, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/28/supreme-court-reinstates-louisiana-house-map-amid-racial-bias-claims-00042924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where a similar court case is unfolding</a>. The justices could go further, too, if they fully side with Alabama’s argument in the case. <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-race-blind-future-of-voting-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One analysis</a> found that if other states used the “race-blind” approach that Alabama is advocating for, the total number of majority-minority districts would be substantially lower. The analysis also found that in the South, where this approach would have the biggest impact, a race-blind map would benefit Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis was conducted at the state house level, not congressional district level, as the larger number of state legislative districts allowed for a finer-grained analysis. The authors noted, though, their findings at the state house level replicate previous results at the congressional district level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That isn’t the way the Voting Rights Act has been interpreted up until now. “The court has accepted the principle that if the use of race is necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act, then it’s constitutional to use race to do so,” Pildes said. But this case could be an opportunity to revisit — and significantly revise — the Voting Rights Act’s requirements. And that could end up reducing minority voters’ electoral power.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Oct. 3, 9:17 a.m.): </strong>An earlier version of this article implied the oral argument for the case about Alabama’s redistricting map will take place on Oct. 3. It is happening on Oct. 4.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In September 2017, Hurricane Irma swept across the southern tip of Florida, swamping what was then the state’s 26th Congressional District. The following July, that district’s Republican representative, Carlos Curbelo, introduced a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill that would tax greenhouse-gas emissions</a> to help reduce the impact of climate change on his hurricane-prone constituency. Curbelo’s party affiliation raised eyebrows at the time, but for him, the threat of recurrent disasters sent political partisanship out the window. “This is not an academic discussion for those of us who live in South Florida. This is a local issue,” he <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/republican-carlos-curbelo-ready-unite-congress-against-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Audubon magazine</a> in 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And he’s not alone. Today, although <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/climate-deniers-117th-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some one-quarter of elected officials</a> walking the halls of Congress don’t believe human-caused climate change is even real, research suggests that politicians can be persuaded to take action on climate change and other environmental issues. Unfortunately, it might take a headline-grabbing hurricane to do it. In the past decade, several studies have suggested that lawmakers are more likely to take action on climate change when they — and their constituents — have had to deal with the disastrous consequences of previously doing nothing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1969 Cuyahoga River fire</a> that led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency to the 1990 Oil Pollution Act that was born out of a series of oil spills, most notably from the Exxon Valdez, a long history of environmental disasters have inspired improvements in environmental policy, said M. Daniele Paserman, an economist at Boston University. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Disasters make environmental problems more salient,” he said. Paserman’s research has found that, between 1989 and 2014, congresspeople from districts hit by a hurricane were more likely to <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25835/w25835.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sponsor or co-sponsor environmental regulatory bills</a> in the following year. And he’s not the only one who has noticed similar correlations. According to another study, which looked at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069614000758?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abnormal temperature and precipitation trends</a> between 2004 and 2011, members of Congress whose home states were experiencing weird weather were more likely to vote for all kinds of environmental legislation. More broadly, international research from 34 countries found that nuclear disasters increased the number of <a href="https://energsustainsoc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13705-020-00256-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewable-energy policies</a> implemented for as long as seven years after the event. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This line of research is relatively new and the number of studies relatively thin. But all of this builds on a larger question that has been studied more in depth: how personally experiencing the effects of climate change shape belief and behavior in the general public. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A 2021 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8284052/#:~:text=Does%20Personal%20Experience%20Shape%20Climate,2014%3B%20Howe%2C%202018)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">review of existing literature</a> discovered ample evidence that living through a natural disaster is associated with higher levels of self-reported belief that climate change is a problem and a greater concern about what this might do to you and your family. Our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own polling with Ipsos earlier this month</a> showed something similar. Even among Republicans, nearly half of those who had experienced an extreme weather event in the past five years told us they were worried about climate change, compared with only 17 percent who hadn’t experienced a natural disaster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there are limits to the ability of a disaster to prevent future calamities. For one thing, the same review paper that showed increased belief in climate change didn’t find a corresponding increase in behaviors that would deal with that issue. And changes in belief are still heavily moderated by what people already think. For example, in a 2019 survey of people who experienced severe flooding in the United Kingdom during the winter of 2013-14, the ones who walked away with the highest levels of concern about climate change were those who had <a href="https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/116789/1/Demski.%20Attribution%20matters.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already attributed floods to global warming</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, it probably shouldn’t be a shock that the much smaller number of papers looking at how politicians might change <em>their</em> behavior in the face of climate change comes with its own set of caveats and complications. Studies have indicated that <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/21/1/23/95076/Silver-Lining-to-Extreme-Weather-Events-Democracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only countries with strong democracies</a> see an increase in climate policy following climate disasters. And Paserman’s study found that the effects were tightly linked to proximity to the disaster. Even lawmakers who served in the same state where a hurricane occurred but whose districts were unaffected weren’t as likely to step up for political change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while that paper found that politicians who experienced climate disasters were more likely to push for climate policies regardless of party, a different study — the one that showed abnormal temperature and precipitation trends were correlated with representatives’ environmental votes — found that party did matter. Moderate Democrats made the biggest shift toward more environmental-policy support, said Erich Muehlegger, an economist at the University of California, Davis, and an author on that paper. “We didn’t find much of a result for Republicans, nor did we find much of a result for the more strident Democrats, though that might be due to the fact that they were always voting for environmental regulations,” he said. “You can’t become more pro-environment if you were already on top of all those issues.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s going to take a lot more research to fully understand why politicians sometimes change their policy in the face of climate disaster and sometimes don’t. Meanwhile, just because lawmakers are responding to natural disasters with environmental votes doesn’t mean they aren’t seeing other, seedier kinds of legislative opportunities from the same event. Ethan Kaplan, an economist at University of Maryland, College Park, and his colleagues found that politicians are likely to use the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster to push through votes favoring the concerns of special-interest donors <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/191433/1/cesifo1_wp7408.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when nobody is paying attention</a>. That’s not a contradiction to the idea that disaster could prompt politicians to take action on climate change. Instead, Kaplan said, the two things can run parallel. A disaster can create a distraction for donors’ goals in the short term, even as it prompts greater environmental policies in the long run. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-still-do-not-show-a-gop-bounce-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that there weren’t yet clear signs of a Republican comeback in polls of the midterm elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This week? The case for a GOP rebound is a little better.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one, Republicans can cite some individual polls that have been favorable for them. There was a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-struggles-party-democrats-2024-poll/story?id=90427262" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> this weekend from ABC News<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight is owned and operated by ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> and the Washington Post, which found Republicans 5 points ahead on the generic congressional ballot among likely voters — a result which would all but assure the GOP of winning the House and make the Senate an uphill battle for Democrats. Republican candidates have also pretty clearly gained ground in some individual Senate races, such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are counterexamples, though. Another <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly rated pollster</a>, Selzer &amp; Co., published a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/Selzer_Grinnell_Sept22_Toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> this week showing Democrats 4 points ahead on the generic ballot among likely voters. Meanwhile, Democrats can cite a few strong recent Senate polls of their own in states such as <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2022/09/27/exclusive-spectrum-news-siena-college-poll-shows-tight-ohio-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, Democrats’ chances of winning the Senate are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68-in-100</a>, according to the Deluxe version of our forecast. That’s down from a high of 71-in-100, which persisted from Sept. 13 to Sept. 20, though that change isn’t large in the big scheme of things. In the House, Democrats’ chances are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">31-in-100</a>, which reflects an even smaller change; their chances were 32-in-100 on Sept. 23 and 24.</p>

So here are five major reasons for hope for the GOP — and concern for Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As an added twist, we’ll engage in a bit of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/model-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model talk</a> as we review these reasons. That is, I’ll tell you whether I think these reasons for hope/concern (depending on who you’re rooting for) are adequately accounted for by our model — or whether they reflect information outside of its scope and assumptions.</p>



<h2><strong>The fundamentals still ought to be pretty good for Republicans</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, this election <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>could</em> be an exception</a> to the usual midterm pushback against the president’s party. But, it’s not always smart to bet on exceptions. So it’s worth going back over the reasons why I and other analysts<em> initially</em> expected this election to be a strong one for Republicans. </p>



<ul><li>The opposition party — in this case, Republicans — has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/">long history</a> of doing well in the midterms. It’s one of the more robust trends in American politics.</li><li>Though his numbers have improved recently, President Biden remains <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">fairly unpopular</a>, with an approval rating of 42 percent.</li><li>Americans remain <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html">quite unhappy</a> about the direction of the country, which tends to hurt the incumbent party.</li><li>Republicans have a big structural advantage in the Senate given that they do well with white, rural voters and that white rural voters are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/">considerably overrepresented in the Senate</a> relative to their overall share of the U.S. population.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this?</strong> Yes. The Classic and Deluxe versions of our model use a blend of polls and fundamentals when evaluating the overall political environment and individual races.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Deluxe version &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; uses expert ratings, in addition to polls and fundamentals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This makes a pretty big difference in the House, where our Lite forecast, which tries to predict the race based on polls alone, gives Republicans a 61-in-100 chance of a House takeover. Those odds jump to 68-in-100 percent in the Deluxe forecast, which takes fundamentals into account. This also boosts the odds of Republicans, who have a 23-in-100 chance of winning the Senate in Lite but a 32-in-100 chance in Deluxe.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The differences between the forecasts were larger at earlier points in the cycle; there isn’t as much time left now for the polls to converge toward the fundamentals. Still, the model assumes that Republicans are more likely to gain ground than to lose ground in the polls between now and November.</p>



<h2><strong>The “issue environment” could get better for Republicans</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/upshot/republicans-midterm-elections.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argument</a> recently advanced by Nate Cohn of The New York Times. During the summer, Democrats benefited from media and voter attention to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Jan. 6 hearings, and the FBI investigation of former President Donald Trump. These issues tend to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-trumps-presence-in-the-midterms-is-risky-for-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remind voters of Republican power and influence</a> and potentially make the election more of a 2020-like choice between Democrats and Republicans and less of a referendum on Biden and Democrats’ performance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But now, issues like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/politics/marthas-vineyard-massachusetts-migrants-planes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/13/business/markets-plunge-on-higher-than-expected-inflation-numbers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy</a> are again <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-feel-about-republican-governors-sending-migrants-to-blue-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting more headlines</a>. That’s not to say abortion and those other issues won’t matter, but the summer could have reflected a best-case scenario for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this?</strong> Not exactly. The model accounts for uncertainty due to future news events. But it doesn’t make any assumptions about whether these surprises tend to benefit one party over another.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But … I’d be careful overthinking this. People who cover politics for a living, including me, live in a bubble full of people who pay far more attention to day-to-day political developments than regular voters do. Pundits’ guesses about which stories voters will care about, or how they will affect their voting preferences, are often wrong. Moreover, the life cycle of stories tends to be pretty short. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s decision to send immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard was a huge story until about a week ago, but now we have a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/28/nord-stream-pipeline-explosions-eu-00059262" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devastating hurricane</a> and a new wave of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/energy-inflation-crises-risk-pushing-big-economies-into-recession-oecd-2022-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic concerns</a> that have usurped it. So in practice, assuming that future news events create uncertainty <em>in both directions</em> will <em>usually</em> be the best course.</p>



<h2><strong>Republicans could overtake Democrats in advertising</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">If I were actually <a href="https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7132/Which-party-will-win-the-2022-US-Senate-election-in-Wisconsin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">betting on election outcomes at prediction markets</a> — and no, I don’t do that for a variety of reasons! — I’d pay attention to the flow of campaign advertising. Advertising may not matter <em>that</em> much in terms of moving votes in an era with relatively few swing voters. But it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/upshot/do-campaign-ads-matter-donald-trump-gives-a-rare-chance-to-find-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certainly matters some</a>, and the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250168734_Short-Term_Effects_of_Advertising_Some_Well-Established_Empirical_Law-Like_Patterns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effects can be short-lived</a>. So if one candidate had a <em>temporary</em> edge on their airwaves, it might lead to a <em>temporary </em>surge in the polls, which would then recede.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So one potential source of concern for Democrats would be if they’d dominated the advertising race during the summer, but only temporarily.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Is this happening? I honestly don’t know. There are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-spend-millions-tv-ads-midterms-why-doesnt-trump-2022-09-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some accounts</a> of Republican groups having boosted spending recently. But while public fundraising and campaign spending is <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/raising-bythenumbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively easy to track</a>, outside spending also plays a large role and is more opaque. Moreover, outside spending has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/by_group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to favor conservatives and Republicans</a> this cycle. With that said, not every dollar is spent equally well. Outside groups <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/13/political-ads-advertisement-campaign-spending-iowa-tv-citizens-united-super-pac-candidate-dark-money/1283739002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t get the same favorable advertising rates</a> that campaigns themselves do, and it’s cheaper to buy ads in advance rather than at the last minute.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this?</strong> Not really. The model doesn’t make any assumptions at all about advertising. It doesn’t discount or adjust a poll because it came during an advertising blitz, for example. Nor does it make any assumption about future advertising spend. The model <em>does</em> account for fundraising; money raised from individual donors is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the factors that the model evaluates</a> in addition to the polls. But this is more because fundraising tends to be a proxy for grassroots support rather than because of any additional advertising leverage it provides.</p>



<h2><strong>Republicans are more likely than not to have an enthusiasm advantage</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason that the <a href="https://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1226a1MidtermPolitics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aforementioned ABC News poll</a> was so worrying for Democrats is because of the relatively large enthusiasm differential it showed between registered voters — among whom Democrats trailed on the generic ballot by only 1 percentage point — and likely voters, among whom they trailed by 5. That 4-point “enthusiasm gap” was somewhat reminiscent of the 2010 midterms, when there was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly a 6-point gap between polls of registered and likely voters</a>, leading to a catastrophic election for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But other polls do not show the same enthusiasm disadvantage for Democrats. As Cohn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/upshot/republicans-midterm-elections.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentions</a>, for instance, there was only a 1-point enthusiasm gap in The New York Times’s recent generic ballot polling. Other <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/17/republicans-enthusiasm-biden-popularity-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> in the wake of the Dobbs decision found that while Republicans were more excited than usual to vote at the midterms, so were Democrats. Democrats have also tended to have strong turnout in recent special elections and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/25/upshot/female-voters-dobbs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ballot referendums</a>. The consensus of the evidence points toward a modest enthusiasm gap favoring Republicans — enough to make matters harder for Democrats, especially in the House — but nothing like the magnitude of 2010.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? </strong>Yes, the model explicitly accounts for the likely GOP enthusiasm advantage. Specifically, it adjusts polls of registered voters to make them equivalent to polls of likely voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Initially, this adjustment is based on historical patterns: Republican voters have historically been more likely to turn out than Democratic ones, and voters of the opposition party are more likely to turn out than voters from the president’s party.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the model begins to override this prior assumption by looking at polls like ABC News’s that publish among both registered and likely voters, but for now it still plays some role and helps Republicans in our forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> In 2018, those factors offset one another (Republicans had the traditional enthusiasm advantage, but Democrats were the opposition party). But this year, they’re both working in the GOP’s favor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I can also see an argument that this assumption is too generous to Republicans, though. Voters at the midterms tend to be older, whiter and more well-educated than voters in presidential years. Historically, these factors all tended to favor Republicans. Now, however — while Republicans are still older and whiter — Democrats tend to dominate among college-educated voters, who are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-022-09717-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considerably more likely to turn out to vote</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>There’s still some reason for Democrats to be concerned about the reliability of the polls</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let me put this carefully. Two weeks ago, I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> about why I don’t agree with the <em>presumption</em> that polls — despite their shortcomings in 2016 and 2020 — are biased toward Democrats:</p>



<blockquote><p>Here, I’m going to present something of a rebuttal […] to the <em>presumption </em>I often see in discussion about polling that polling bias is predictable and necessarily favors Democrats. My contention is that while the polls could have another bad year, it’s hard to know right now whether that bias will benefit Democrats or Republicans. People’s guesses about this are often wrong. In 2014, for example, there was a lot of discussion about whether the polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-the-state-polls-skewed/">would have a pro-Republican bias</a>, as they did in 2012. But they turned out to have a pro-Democratic bias instead.</p></blockquote>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a lot of qualifications here. It doesn’t mean that the polls can’t have a bad year. But the idea behind the FiveThirtyEight model is that they’ll be biased toward Democrats in some years, they’ll be biased toward Republicans in some years, and they’ll be unbiased in some years — and it’s hard to know what you’re getting ahead of time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ve read various rebuttals to this article, some of which I find a little lacking. For instance, I simply don’t think it’s correct to claim, as Andrew Prokop <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/9/23/23353634/polls-bias-democrats-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently did in Vox</a>, that polls overestimated Democratic performance in 2018.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prokop makes this claim by focusing on so-called competitive Senate races, but there are a few problems with that. The definition of competitive races is arbitrary, and in 2018, many Senate races that were assumed to be competitive were conducted in strongly red states, such as Missouri, Tennessee and West Virginia. In House and gubernatorial races, by contrast, which provide for a more comprehensive picture, polls had a slight &lt;em&gt;Republican&lt;/em&gt; bias, &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to FiveThirtyEight’s analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> To treat anti-Republican bias in the polls as a sort of inescapable empirical regularity based on a sample of two election cycles, neither of which was the most recent midterm, is making too much of limited evidence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But does that mean I give no credence at all to what we might call the Predictable Democratic Polling Bias (PDPB) hypothesis? No, of course not. Good <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/05/everybodys-an-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fox-like</a> forecasters can hold multiple ideas or hypotheses in their head at once. PDPB has some things going for it. My mental model of the race might be something like: mostly the FiveThirtyEight forecast, but with a little smidge of weight that PDPB is real.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s the case <em>for</em> PDPB? Again, I don’t think it’s an empirical one. Empirically, the evidence strongly shows that polling bias is unpredictable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the theoretical case that analyst Richard Hanania makes for PDPB in his recent <a href="https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-polling-might-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substack post</a> is plausible. If, fundamentally, Republicans are less likely to answer surveys because (for instance) they have lower social trust, that’s not necessarily an <em>intractable</em> problem. But it could be one that hasn’t been addressed yet. It could take pollsters a couple of election cycles to work out the right approach, especially if it requires abandoning traditional polling best practices.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly enough, PDPB wouldn’t necessarily doom Democrats in the Senate. Even if polls had a 3-point pro-Democratic bias, Democrat John Fetterman would <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still be favored in Pennsylvania</a>, where he leads by 6 points in our polling average. Democratic incumbents Raphael Warnock in Georgia and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada would technically be underdogs (they currently lead by 2.1 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively). But Georgia and Nevada have had fairly accurate polling in recent years. Any amount of PDPB would doom Democrats’ chances in the House, however.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? </strong>Sort of.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although the model doesn’t assume any sort of permanent polling bias, it does give some weight to the fundamentals, and as I mentioned above, the fundamentals are more favorable to Republicans than the polls alone. The Deluxe forecast also considers expert ratings, and although how it uses these ratings is slightly complicated (read the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">methodology section</a> for more), those do help Republican odds in the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps if you give a little bit of extra mental weight to PDPB, it would be enough to account for the relatively small differences between the FiveThirtyEight forecast and <a href="https://electionbettingodds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">betting markets</a>. For instance, betting markets give Republicans a 39 percent chance of winning Senate control, as compared to 31 percent in our Deluxe forecast, and a 75 percent chance of House control, instead of 68 percent. Those are small enough differences that I’m not sure I’d make huge bets on either side.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Protests in Iran <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/amid-protests-irans-guard-strikes-kurdish-groups-iraq-90513367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been raging</a> on for nearly two weeks because <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/calls-probe-iranian-womans-death-amid-protests-90195651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22-year-old Mahsa Amini died</a> in the custody of the “morality police” after she allegedly failed to comply with the nation’s veiling laws. The protests that <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/28/what-we-know-after-11-days-of-protests-in-iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began on the streets of Saqqez</a>, her hometown, have now spread to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/world/middleeast/iran-protests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 80 cities</a> across the nation, as Iranian women lead demonstrations in defiance of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62967381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a law that mandates</a> they cover their hair and wear loose-fitting clothes while in public. At least <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63047363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76 people have died</a>, although the toll is likely higher as internet restrictions have made information harder to confirm. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Amini’s death may have sparked this recent uprising, but data shows Iranian opposition toward required veiling isn’t new. The Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran, a Netherlands-based research foundation, conducted <a href="https://gamaan.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GAMAAN-Iran-Religion-Survey-2020-English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a comprehensive study</a> in 2020 on Iranians’ opinions about religion and found that a whopping 72 percent of literate Iranians over age 19<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, “The target population consisted of literate Iranian residents above 19 years old (who were capable of using the Internet and reading the survey questions). … This accounts for 85% of the adult population of Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> disagreed with the government mandating that women wear the hijab in public, compared with only 15 percent who agreed with it. Over the years, those who have subverted the law have faced <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/23/amini-hijab-morality-police-iran/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violent beatings</a> and, in the case of Amini, fatal consequences at the hands of the government. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These events have brought a simmering question to a boil: In a world <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-08-11/religion-giving-god" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly secular</a> and interconnected, what role do people think theology should play in determining law? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Iran is now associated with mandatory veiling, that was not always the case. In 1936, the penultimate shah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/iran-and-the-headscarf-protests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decreed a ban</a> on hijab in an attempt to promote European attire. Women who failed to comply with this prior law similarly faced punishments, such as imprisonment. The newer mandate, which Iranians are protesting now, was implemented when the pro-Western, secular monarchy was replaced with an Islamic theocracy after the 1979 revolution. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, the veil was banned, and now it’s mandatory. But once again, most Iranians are proponents of change — not just for hijab law but also for the role of religion in government more broadly. Only 22 percent of literate Iranians over age 19<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, “The target population consisted of literate Iranian residents above 19 years old (who were capable of using the Internet and reading the survey questions). … This accounts for 85% of the adult population of Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> believe an Islamic republic is the most suitable governing structure for their country, according to a <a href="https://gamaan.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GAMAAN-Political-Systems-Survey-2022-English-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> by GAMAAN conducted in February. Meanwhile, in a separate question, 88 percent agreed that having a democratic system would be a good idea. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also in that study, two-thirds said they did not want a government run according to religious law, which challenges the inherent premise of the country’s current governing structure. In contrast, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/13/half-of-americans-say-bible-should-influence-u-s-laws-including-28-who-favor-it-over-the-will-of-the-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half of all Americans thought</a> the Bible should have at least some bearing on the law, despite this nation’s <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/separation_of_church_and_state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">principles separating church and state</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the decades since its 1979 revolution, Iran has faced its fair share of political uprisings — due to claims of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/world/middleeast/14iran.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rigged elections</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/protests-grip-major-iran-cities-gas-prices-killed-67076102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soaring gas prices</a>, for example. But this current political moment has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/world/middleeast/iran-protests-raisi-khamenei-hijab.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uniquely united</a> Iranian women across socioeconomic, ethnic and regional lines. Furthermore, the recent demonstrations are not simply a protest of the current ruling politicians but also one that challenges how religion underpins the law overall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Outside of Iran, however, the global trend has been toward repression of religion in the public sphere. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/30/key-findings-about-restrictions-on-religion-around-the-world-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew has tracked</a> government limitations on religion since 2007. According to data published in 2021, Pew found that the global level of politically affiliated religious restriction was higher than it had been for most of the prior decade. Meanwhile, the history of Iran shows that both forced and forbidden faith can lead to dangerous consequences for citizens. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-internet-censorship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing internet shutdowns</a> will likely keep international eyes from seeing everything happening in Iran, including the government’s violence toward those speaking up. But quashing protests will not necessarily mean quashing dissent. Although Ali Khamenei, Iran’s current supreme leader, has long posited <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa/supreme-leader-khamenei-says-u-s-is-irans-number-one-enemy-idUSKBN1D211H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside influences, especially the U.S.</a>, as the greatest threat to his rule, this moment suggests that Iran’s own citizens — and its women in particular — could present a huge challenge to the power of theocracy.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The share of Democrats who believe President Biden should run for office again has ticked up slightly over the past two months, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/09/28/democrats-believe-biden-should-run-2024-primary-harris/">per recent polling from Morning Consult/Politico</a>. Fifty-nine percent of Democratic voters said they’d support his reelection campaign in a Sept. 23-25 survey, up from 51 percent in early July and 53 percent in early August. In the case that he does not run, however, a plurality of Democratic voters (28 percent) said they would support Vice President Kamala Harris instead, followed by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (13 percent). </li></ul><ul><li>In light of Hurricane Ian, the Jan. 6 House Select Committee postponed its ninth hearing, which was scheduled for Sept. 28 and would have been the first since July. Though a new date has yet to be announced, 58 percent of Americans support resuming the hearings following those in the summer, according to <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_092722/">a poll from Monmouth University</a> conducted Sept. 21-25. Unsurprisingly, that number reveals a highly partisan divide: 83 percent of Democrats reported wanting the hearings to continue, but only 31 percent of Republicans agreed. And while 62 percent of Democrats said the hearings should carry on as long as necessary, 75 percent of Republicans said the investigation should conclude as soon as possible. </li></ul><ul><li>On the heels of President Vladimir Putin granting Russian citizenship to former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, a Sept. 28 <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/09/28/c07fb/2">YouGov survey</a> asked Americans about his notorious 2013 leak of top-secret information on government surveillance. Thirty-nine percent said Snowden’s actions constituted “the right thing to do.” <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/09/28/c07fb/1">Additional polling</a> found that almost 6 in 10 Americans think it is “somewhat” (29 percent) or “very” (29 percent) common that the U.S. government surveils ordinary citizens who aren’t suspected of committing a crime. Nonetheless, a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/09/28/c07fb/3">third question</a> showed that only around a quarter of Americans (27 percent) take any precautions to avoid surveillance of their personal devices, although that number varies by age: While only 19 percent of adults 65 or over say they take such precautions, that share increases to 35 percent among those under 30. </li></ul><ul><li>Overall, just 26 percent of Americans are at least somewhat interested in learning more about the metaverse, but according to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/09/27/frequent-moviegoers-are-more-open-to-metaverse/">polling from Morning Consult</a> conducted Aug. 24-25, that share rises to 63 percent among moviegoers who frequent theaters at least three times a month. That’s even more than gamers (55 percent), sports betters (50 percent) or those with five or more streaming subscriptions (40 percent). Those moviegoers were also much more likely than Americans in general to report having read, heard or seen mentions of the metaverse.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

At this time <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-feel-about-republican-governors-sending-migrants-to-blue-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, 42.5 percent approved and 53.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -10.5 points).

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This 2016 story followed a team of Waffle House operations analysts as they decided whether to close any of the chain’s locations in preparation for Hurricane Matthew, a Category 5 storm that ended up affecting the Florida coast as a Category 2 storm. This week, as at least 21 Waffle House locations in Florida closed due to </em><a href="https://www.al.com/life/2022/09/hurricane-ian-so-severe-that-florida-waffle-houses-are-closing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hurricane Ian</em></a><em>,</em><em> we thought we should revisit what happens when the famously resilient restaurant shuts its doors for a storm — and why even the federal government pays attention when it does. </em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a warm, cloudy morning in the first week of October, in an anonymous office park just outside Atlanta, operations analyst Matt Stark opened a computer program, ran through some data and looked thoughtfully at the results.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Out in the Atlantic Ocean, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Matthew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hurricane Matthew</a> was hurling winds of 115 miles an hour toward the coast of Florida. Hundreds of miles inland, in the headquarters of Waffle House Inc., Stark’s software predicted that 477 of the chain’s almost 1,900 restaurants might be affected by the onrushing storm.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This meant two things. First, as the storm made landfall, some locations of Waffle House — which boasts that every restaurant stays open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year — would probably have to close because of power loss or concerns for workers’ safety. And second, sometime after they did, someone would invoke the “Waffle House Index,” the slightly flippant measure of how bad a storm can get.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Matthew brought on both those expected scenarios. Waffle House announced Oct. 6 that it was pre-emptively closing some restaurants on a 90-mile stretch of Interstate 95 between Fort Pierce and Titusville in Florida. (In the next few days, as the storm churned up the coast and flooded North Carolina, it would close 98 all told.) And as soon as the announcement went out, media tracking the storm, and customers on social media, invoked the closings as a sign of the apocalypse.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article106546297.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami Herald</a>: “When Waffle House surrenders to a hurricane, you know it’s bad.” The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/10/07/hurricane-matthew-is-so-scary-even-waffle-house-is-evacuating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a>: “Hurricane Matthew is so scary even the always-open eatery is evacuating.” A faithful <a href="https://twitter.com/e20b255b/status/784131483627696128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer on Twitter</a>: “GOD IN HEAVEN THIS IS THE END!”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In those areas, the Waffle House Index had just gone to red.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Disaster responders pay attention to that index, which was created — in the midst of 2004’s devastating Hurricane Charley — by W. Craig Fugate, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency since 2009. Fugate was director of emergency management for Florida when Charley slammed the state with unexpected force: Its winds strengthened abruptly and it went from a Category 2 to a Category 4, and the storm suddenly changed direction and struck the state’s Gulf Coast at Sanibel, 150 miles south of its predicted landfall. Tens of thousands of people were reportedly left homeless.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fugate was in his office with state meteorologist Ben Nelson and members of the Florida National Guard, color-coding infrastructure loss on a map — green for operating, yellow for affected, and red for destroyed — and the group decided to take a look at some of the damage, and try to find a meal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They went to a Waffle House and noticed they had a limited menu, with nonperishable items,” Alexa Lopez, FEMA’s press secretary, told me. “The next day, they were driving around and they went to a different Waffle House, and the same thing happened, a limited menu.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, she said, the group was inspired first to rank Waffle Houses in the same way: green for fully operational, yellow for a limited menu and red for closed. “Which is pretty bad, because Waffle House is always open,” Lopez added. And, second, to use those observations as a proxy for how much a disaster disrupts a community. Fugate has since been quoted as saying: “If you get there and the Waffle House is closed? That’s really bad. That’s where you go to work.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The concept of restaurant operations as an indicator of storm impact percolated slowly into emergency-management culture — the magazine Environment Health Safety Today wrote about it <a href="http://ehstoday.com/fire_emergencyresponse/disaster-planning/waffles-risk-management-0706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in July 2011</a> — and broke out into the open around the time of Hurricane Irene in August 2011 (when, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904716604576542460736605364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to The Wall Street Journal</a>, 22 Waffle Houses lost power but only one stayed closed longer than a day)<strong>.</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the so-called index isn’t actually an official metric. FEMA doesn’t publish it anywhere; no one, except for Waffle House itself, counts how many restaurants are running lean or forced to close. But the company does give that count to the agency, and FEMA uses it — along with wind speeds and power outages and other objective measures — to judge a storm’s impact, and to figure out where its own crews and other emergency responders can get fed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, so obvious: If a storm is bad enough to close restaurants that “never close,” we can agree that storm is bad. Hurricane Matthew was the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/first-above-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season-since-2012-produced-five-landfalling-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest storm</a> of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, which ended Nov. 30.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the Waffle House Index also stands for something less obvious. It is an indicator of how complex and long supply chains are — for food, for fuel, for power — and of what it takes to plan around infrastructure that can be fragile in unexpected ways.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The essence of the index is not just that the situation is bad,” Panos Kouvelis, director of the Boeing Center for Supply Chain Innovation at Washington University in St. Louis, told me. “Companies like Waffle House, and Wal-Mart and Home Depot, operate in areas that are frequently hit by disasters, where their operations may go down at the same time the demand for their services go up. So they have had to develop very well-defined playbooks for being prepared.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But preparation is a complicated endeavor in an economy where few things are sold in the places where they were made. Vanilla comes from Madagascar. The United States imports most of its salt. The plywood needed to protect windows from storm debris might have been manufactured in China, and a storm in the Gulf of Mexico can force enough interruption on petroleum refining to choke off supply on the other side of the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“When I talk to companies about whether they understand their supply chains, they generally know one step up and back: who they buy from and who they sell to,” said Amy Kircher, director of the Food Protection and Defense Institute at the University of Minnesota. “They don’t understand that there are five or 10 steps in the chain before the product reaches them. Or that the alternate suppliers they consider their contingency plan are all buying from the same place.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At Waffle House headquarters in November, Stark and his colleagues on the chain’s storm team — Vice Presidents Pat Warner and Will Mizell and Communications Director Kelly Thrasher-Bruner, who handles social media in disasters — walked me through how they prepare. As we talked, Stark pulled up an updated post-Matthew map. Of 200 restaurants that ended up in the storm’s path, just one, in inland North Carolina, gleamed red, for “still affected”; it had been flooded and needed cleaning out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s a big deal for us to shut down, because we’re not used to turning everything off and turning the lights off and closing the door,” said Warner, who estimates that he has worked “more than 10” hurricane responses in 17 years. “So our goal is to open up as quickly as possible afterward. The operations team works with the distributor to get food ready to go in. The construction team lines up generators. If you have generators you have to have fuel, so we line up that.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the edge of the predicted storm zone — which Stark monitors from a temporary “war room” assembled by putting mobile giant screens in a conference room — the company positions personnel who can swoop in: carpenters, electricians, IT specialists, a food-safety expert and someone to talk to local governments and law enforcement and soothe concerns about curfews. A little farther out, restaurants in other markets line up “jump teams”: spare personnel who volunteer to work in place of locals who might have evacuated or might need to repair their homes or care for family. In Hurricane Matthew, the company sent in an extra 250 people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We say we throw chaos at chaos,” Mizell said. “We just throw a lot of resources down there to get restaurants open. Our CEO will be there. In Matthew, our chairman was there, too.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before the carpenters and computer specialists or the replacement cooks and servers arrive, the company assesses how long it has been since supplies were delivered and — just as crucial — how long since the local trash removal company last emptied the dumpster. “Most restaurants get a delivery once a week,” Stark said. “If it got there Wednesday and the storm hits Thursday, they should have enough food, but if the storm hits Tuesday, we may have to hurry up and get some food there.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Waffle House uses one main distributor, Illinois-based US Foods, which has depots scattered across the Southeast, where most Waffle Houses are concentrated, and where many hurricanes that strike the U.S. make landfall. So supplies don’t need to travel far in advance of a storm and are close by once roads are clear.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That model of staging supplies and personnel in layers outside an emergency, in order to swoop in quickly once it abates, isn’t unique to Waffle House. It’s also followed by the military and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which oversees the Strategic National Stockpile of emergency medications, vaccines and antidotes for natural disasters and biological attacks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We think about, What are the timelines in which people have to be provided medications?” Greg Burel, the stockpile’s director, told me. “Our primary stock is laid down in undisclosed locations around the country that give us access to large swaths of the population and that are accessible” by more than one type of transportation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the CDC also puts smaller, lighter assets — the equivalent of a temporary field hospital or a stash of medications that could be deployed immediately — “as far forward as we can if we have advance notice, but not so far forward that it becomes victim to that event,” Burel said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The first rule of operating in a disaster, though, is keeping personnel safe. Every Waffle House employee gets a key fob with lists of relevant phone numbers. Local managers keep track of who has challenging home situations — disabled parents, children with special needs, single heads of household — and might need extra help. Every location has a wall-mounted “crisis response” flier that includes detachable wallet cards listing personal-preparedness steps for hurricanes, tornadoes and ice storms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The cards also remind employees how needed they will be at work. “We will be very busy,” the current hurricane-preparedness card says, “and you will make lots of money!”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="862" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/waffle_inline.jpg.webp" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/waffle_inline.jpg.webp" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/waffle_inline.jpg.webp?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/waffle_inline.jpg.webp?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Once employees arrive or return and a location can open, they work through the storm manual: a giant binder, a kind of choose-your-own-adventure game composed in eggs and grits. “Here’s how you run the restaurant if you’re without power, without gas for the grills, without water,” Mizell said. “We can cook on the grills even if we don’t have electricity. We can bring in bottled water and canned Coke products and serve on to-go plates. We can get porta-potties.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The storm team examines what worked and didn’t after every disaster, each time learning new lessons. In Hurricane Katrina — when they closed 107 locations in Mississippi and on the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain — roads were so bad they stashed supplies in a refrigerated semi-trailer with armed guards, and fuel so scarce they brought in their own tank trucks. When Katrina struck in 2005, Twitter had not yet launched; now Bruner uses it not just to alert customers to closings, but to crowdsource whether roads are open and where the power is on.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Waffle House began working on storm response before Katrina — Warner said he thinks the first organized attempt was <a href="http://www.weather.gov/ilm/HurricaneHugo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hurricane Hugo</a>, which hit Charleston, South Carolina, in September 1989 — but from then to now, the company’s biggest need in disasters hasn’t changed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“People,” Warner said. “We can get the food there, by hook or by crook. It costs more, but we’re willing to spend it. But if we don’t have people, we can’t open up.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Once again, everyone <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-20/hollywood-s-paltrow-joins-soros-backing-beto-o-rourke-in-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t</a> <a href="https://abc.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/video/vdka29896870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop</a> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/23/beto-o-rourke-texas-democrats-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking about</a> <a href="https://www.cc.com/episodes/fgmych/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-september-21-2022-beto-o-rourke-season-27-ep-135" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beto O’Rourke</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a><a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> shows a single-digit contest in the Texas gubernatorial race between O’Rourke and the Republican incumbent, Greg Abbott. Earlier this year, O’Rourke made headlines for his <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/07/15/texas-governor-2022-abbott-orourke-fundraising-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking fundraising</a>, and the fallout from a succession of high-profile events in the state — the <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/texas/2022/08/25/431599/texas-republicans-long-sought-trigger-law-on-abortion-now-in-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triggering of a preexisting state law</a> banning abortions, continued <a href="https://www.sacurrent.com/news/texas-experienced-more-power-outages-than-any-other-state-over-the-past-20-years-report-says-29896472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strains on the power grid</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/us/uvalde-back-to-school.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass shooting</a> at an elementary school in Uvalde, one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history — are giving him unexpected leverage against Abbott. As a result, this gubernatorial election could be one of Texas’s most competitive since Democrats last held the office in the 1990s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s be real about one thing, though: The overall electoral environment might be improving for Democrats, but O’Rourke is still a serious long shot. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm-election forecast</a><a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> gives Abbott a 95-in-100 chance of besting his ubiquitous Democratic challenger. But is it possible that after his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closer-than-expected</a> Senate race against Ted Cruz in 2018 and rise to national prominence after a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-beto-orourkes-pivot-didnt-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly eight-month campaign</a> in the 2020 presidential election, a narrow loss against Abbott in November could be a victory for Texas Democrats in the long run?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea that O’Rourke could be laying the groundwork for future Democratic victories in Texas isn’t a crazy one. After all, other <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-georgia-turned-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Southern states like Georgia</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-hope-georgia-will-become-the-next-virginia-but-it-could-end-up-being-the-next-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia and North Carolina</a> have become somewhat more competitive over the past <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several election cycles</a>. But another close statewide race for O’Rourke this year doesn’t necessarily mean Texas is on the verge of turning blue — or even purple. That’s because O’Rourke is, well, O’Rourke, and without a stronger campaign infrastructure throughout the state, it will be hard for most Texas Democrats running in statewide elections to replicate his level of fundraising and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/02/11/beto-orourke-supporters-texas-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fanfare</a>. And, fundamentally, Texas is still a red-leaning state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">O’Rourke’s campaign style is hard to emulate because, for one, he’s become a buzzy celebrity candidate since his 2018 race, and he has a gift for making headlines. When he’s not <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/08/11/beto-orourke-uvalde-gun-heckler/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standing up to hecklers</a> at campaign events or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/25/beto-orourke-greg-abbott-uvalde-shooting-interrupt/?itid=lk_inline_manual_22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interrupting Abbott at a news conference</a> in Uvalde, where 19 students and two teachers died <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/us/uvalde-back-to-school.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a mass shooting</a>, O’Rourke has made a name for himself by <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/what-makes-beto-run-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zig-zagging his Toyota Tundra</a> across the state, snapping selfies with voters and <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article264407536.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping f-bombs</a> to fire up his base. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the chart below shows, public curiosity about O’Rourke has waned since his 2020 run, according to Google Trends data, but he’s still able to draw national attention. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Search interest for Beto O'Rourke peaked in 2019" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3tY0d/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">But politicians can only get so far on personality alone — and O’Rourke is no exception. That doesn’t mean he isn’t a strong candidate, though. A poll fielded in late August and early September by the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/blog/new-uttexas-politics-project-poll-abbott-maintains-45-40-lead-over-o%E2%80%99rourke-52-support-busing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin</a> gave Abbott only a 5-percentage-point edge over O’Rourke. And another, more recent, poll from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a> conducted in late September gave Abbott a slightly larger, 7-point edge. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, it’s unlikely that O’Rourke will be able to build a lasting campaign infrastructure for future Texas Democrats to replicate if they want to run statewide. That’s because of one major problem: an apparent lack of organization among the Democratic Party in Texas. To build on O’Rourke’s 2018 — and likely 2022 — margins against incumbent Republicans, the party would need to build and sustain a solid campaign infrastructure well past this year’s midterm elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“One of the issues for Democrats here is that there’s been a lot of turnover in their candidate pool,” said James Henson, the executive director of the Texas Politics Project. “To me, that’s a pretty big indicator that there’s not really an established, institutional foundation in the Democratic Party here in the way that you <em>do</em> see it on the Republican side.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition to issues with <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-democrats-recruitment-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruitment and turnover</a> facing Democrats running in marquee Texas races — save for O’Rourke and former oil executive Mike Collier, who is <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/politics/texas-lieutenant-governor-race-2022/285-08a76600-ec40-44f2-a83b-77233a2fa39e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick</a> again after losing to him by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-texas-elections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 points in 2018</a> — the party has <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/01/analysis-lupe-valdez-long-time-cop-why-didnt-she-lead-school-safety-co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run inexperienced candidates</a> against formidable Republicans and doesn’t have a presence in a sizable chunk of the state. Case in point: Over 50 of Texas’s 254 counties have <a href="https://www.texasdemocrats.org/county-parties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no organized county party or leaders</a>, according to the state Democratic Party’s website. A notable number of those counties are in rural parts of the state too, and even in 2018, O’Rourke won the support of only <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/02/beto-orourke-rural-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 percent of the voters</a> living in Texas’s 186 rural<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined here as having a &lt;a href="https://tlc.texas.gov/docs/policy/Def_Rural_Statutes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;population of less than 50,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>23</sup></a> counties, according to The Texas Tribune. Cruz, in contrast, won over 75 percent of the vote there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, Henson told me, there’s no obvious successor who can build off — and improve upon — the infrastructure that O’Rourke’s campaign has created. “In the past, there were times when successful campaigns, at least indirectly, provided people with a model for organizing and professional skills,” Henson said. “But that’s just not happening here in Texas.” In 2018, O’Rourke’s close contest against Cruz helped Democrats Lizzie Fletcher of Houston and Colin Allred of Dallas flip two congressional districts by each unseating a long-term Republican incumbent. Democrats had a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/06/texas-midterm-election-results-texas-house-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net gain of 12 seats in the Texas House</a> as well. But then, in 2020, Texas Democrats <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/22/texas-democrats-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell short</a> of their electoral goals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are other reasons, though, why a close win for O’Rourke doesn’t necessarily speak to Democrats’ political future in Texas. For one, the Republican Party’s brand is still strong in Texas. When it comes to key policy issues, polling suggests that voters still overwhelmingly trust Republicans over Democrats. The August-September Texas Politics Project survey, for example, showed that voters were more likely to trust Abbott over O’Rourke on handling issues like the U.S.-Mexico border situation and the economy. Voters trusted O’Rourke more on abortion, however. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet while voters were divided over who could better handle gun violence, Texans said the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/most-important-issue-facing-texas-august-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top issues</a> facing the state were border security, immigration, political corruption/leadership and inflation/rising prices — abortion and gun control/gun violence were further down their list. That means that any Democrat running after O’Rourke would need to win voters’ trust on these issues — and that’s a tall order given that even O’Rourke has had only limited success.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="On issues most important to Texans, voters trust Abbott more" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/J3OFw/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="559" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/15/texas-demographics-census-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demographic changes in Texas</a> that at one point may have been viewed as good news for Democrats might not end up working in their favor. The state’s Hispanic population is growing, but demographics are not destiny in American politics — and those voters might be <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/democrats-losing-texas-latinos-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hard bloc</a> for Democrats to make further gains with, especially after Texas’s border counties <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved sharply to the right</a> in 2020. Voters in other rural parts of the state have also been hard for Democrats to win, and despite O’Rourke’s campaigning in rural counties, it’s not clear whether even he is <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/02/beto-orourke-rural-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making significant inroads</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And so far, O’Rourke hasn’t necessarily provided a foolproof model for winning over <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/2022-gubernatorial-vote-intention-august-2022#party-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican and independent voters</a>, whose support he’d need to beat Abbott in what is still a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red-leaning state</a>. O’Rourke might be a major presence in Texas, but he’s not actually that popular. A September poll from the <a href="https://www.uttyler.edu/politicalscience/files/dmn-uttyler-sept2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Tyler for The Dallas Morning News</a>, for instance, found that almost half of the state’s registered voters — 47 percent — had a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion of O’Rourke compared with 40 percent who viewed him in a positive light. He didn’t fare well with independent voters, either: 46 percent had an unfavorable view of O’Rourke versus 34 percent who had a favorable opinion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The survey didn’t ask respondents to assess Abbott’s favorability, but exactly half of voters said they strongly or somewhat approved of his job performance as governor; meanwhile, 47 percent said they disapproved. Those numbers have given O’Rourke’s opponents an opportunity, too. Since his presidential campaign, he has given Republicans a useful foil to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/15/texas-beto-orourke-guns-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspire their own turnout</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, for Texas Democrats to succeed statewide, they’d need to have a healthy mixture of O’Rourke’s popularity, an appeal to a wider swath of voters and, ideally, not be a bogeyman or bogey(wo)man for Republicans. That’s a big ask in a state that hasn’t fielded especially strong Democratic candidates beyond O’Rourke in the past few statewide election cycles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, because the Democratic candidate is O’Rourke — a micro-celebrity in the state and nationwide — the race could be close. That said, his race likely won’t say much about Texas Democrats’ larger ambitions to flip the state because there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done before they get there.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are election deniers, and then there’s Kari Lake. While <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">201 Republican nominees</a><a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 28 at 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> have fully denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, few have made claims of fraud as central to their campaign as Lake, the Republican nominee for Arizona governor. A <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/07/trump-gop-kari-lake-00050215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">darling among former President Donald Trump’s endorsees</a>, Lake has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-denying-primary-candidates-are-crying-fraud-win-or-lose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeated his unfounded claims</a> that the 2020 election was “stolen” and spread <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/08/1116394618/arizona-pinal-county-election-woes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baseless conspiracy theories</a> about election fraud. And she looks well-positioned to take on her Democratic opponent, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, as it’s currently a toss-up with Hobbs at a 52-in-100 chance to Lake’s 48-in-100, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to our midterm forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 28 at 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So why then, in another statewide race in this purple state, is a fellow Trump-endorsed election denier facing tougher odds? Blake Masters, the Republican nominee for Senate, has just a 17-in-100 chance of winning against incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s Senate forecast</a>. Like Lake, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9fQaWdTIZQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masters has claimed</a> Trump “won in 2020,” and said he <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/2022-live-primary-election-race-results/2022/08/03/1115185686/blake-masters-trump-pick-funded-by-billionaire-thiel-wins-arizona-senate-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn’t have accepted the results</a> if he were in office at the time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, these races are about more than election denialism. While 2020 has cast a long shadow over many campaigns, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/27/arizona-voters-concerns-inflation-abortion-threats-democracy/8124857001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most voters in the state are more concerned</a> with issues like inflation and abortion than election fraud. And even when it comes to election denial, there is some daylight between Lake and Masters’s positions. Still, these candidates have a lot of similarities, at least on paper, so why is one in a toss-up and the other struggling to keep up? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s stress test a few theories of where these two candidates are similar — and where they differ — to see if we can unravel the mystery of Blake and Lake. </p>



<h2><strong>Different races, different opponents</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One possible explanation is simply that Lake and Masters are squaring off against different opponents. Kelly has a couple of advantages that Hobbs doesn’t. For one, Kelly is an incumbent, and a popular one — in a September survey of likely Arizona voters <a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/politics/2022/aarp-arizona-2022-elections-voter-survey-governor.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00550.011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by AARP/Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research</a>, the senator had a 50 percent approval rating, including a 14 percent approval rating among Republicans (as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/09/rising-partisan-antipathy-widening-party-gap-in-presidential-job-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far as cross-party approval</a> goes, that’s pretty good). As a former astronaut and the husband of <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/14267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Rep. Gabby Giffords,</a> he has a lot of name recognition and a healthy amount of public goodwill. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Hobbs has been unavoidably at the center of the election denial issue. As secretary of state, Hobbs was responsible for administering the 2020 election and certifying the results, making her <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/10/11/the-unstoppable-kari-lake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persona non grata</a> for voters who baselessly believe that the election was fraudulent. Hobbs was also <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/12/08/katie-hobbs-apologizes-recognizes-discrimination-talonya-adams-firing/6426337001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embroiled in an actual scandal</a> last year over the prior firing of a staffer while she was in the state Senate. And Hobbs has <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/09/12/katie-hobbs-is-a-chicken-for-ducking-a-debate-kari-lakes-campaign-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to debate Lake</a>, a move that has given her opponent <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/09/12/katie-hobbs-is-a-chicken-for-ducking-a-debate-kari-lakes-campaign-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of fuel</a> for attacks while preventing voters from seeing the two candidates square off head-to-head (though they will both <a href="https://ktar.com/story/5264155/katie-hobbs-kari-lake-set-to-participate-in-town-hall-event-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be participating</a> in a town hall forum next week). Combined, these factors show Hobbs as a weaker opponent than Kelly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But FiveThirtyEight’s polling averages suggest that’s not the sole explanation for the differences in these two races. The polls show <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masters struggling to keep up</a> with Kelly, while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake is giving</a> Hobbs a run for her money. But if you look at total vote shares, it’s clear that the biggest difference is not between Kelly and Hobbs — it’s between Lake and Masters. Kelly, Hobbs and Lake are all within spitting distance of each other: Kelly has 49 percent support, Hobbs 47 percent, and Lake is right on Hobbs’s tail with 46 percent. But Masters is the odd one out with only 42 percent support, showing that in these races, the biggest gulf is between the GOP candidates, not their opponents. </p>



<h2><strong>Mo’ money, no problems?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">If their respective opponents aren’t to blame for the discrepancy between Lake and Masters, maybe their bank accounts are. While never a guarantee of a win, a well-funded campaign can sometimes explain the difference in a close race. In the governor’s race, the most recent <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/Reporting/Explore#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2023%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state election filings</a> show Lake has brought in $3.8 million and spent $3.6 million, while Hobbs has outraised her only marginally, <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/Reporting/Explore#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2023%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing in $4.4 million</a> and spending $3.9 million. In the Senate race, Masters <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AZ00372/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised just over $5 million</a>. But Kelly. Oh, Kelly. He has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/fundraising-totals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the highest-funded election campaigns</a> in the country, having raised over $54 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0AZ00350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as of July</a>, spending over $30 million, so it’s almost certainly even higher as we head into the midterms. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it certainly <em>seems</em> like we found our outlier, but as I mentioned above, the starkest differences in the polls are between support for the GOP nominees, not the Democrats. Kelly’s flush coffers have likely helped him tamp down his opponent more effectively than Hobbs, but it also doesn’t explain the whole story. </p>



<h2><strong>Beyond 2020</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s return to the assumptions at the top that Lake and Masters are, at least on paper, very similar candidates. While it’s true that they both have repeated lies about the 2020 election and have been endorsed by Trump, they differ in a couple of crucial ways. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First is that Masters <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/politics/blake-masters-campaign-website-changes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has backtracked from the 2020 election issue</a>, scrubbing language from his website claiming that Trump would have won “if we had had a free and fair election.” At first glance, this dovier posture would seem to play to Masters’s benefit. After all, Biden did win Arizona in 2020 — albeit by less than 1 percentage point — and moderate candidates <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jrodden/oslo/canes_wrone_et_al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to perform better</a> than more extreme ones. While we don’t know that Masters has suffered uniquely by taking this stance, we do know that GOP voters in Arizona aren’t exactly disqualifying candidates who take an <em>extreme </em>stance. For example, in the race for Arizona’s secretary of state, Republican candidate Mark Finchem has remained an extreme election denier (including <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/09/23/mark-finchems-fealty-to-the-big-lie-was-center-stage-in-debate-with-adrian-fontes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending most of a recent debate</a> regurgitating baseless conspiracy theories) and yet <a href="https://ktar.com/story/5256448/republican-mark-finchem-leads-adrian-fontes-in-arizona-secretary-of-state-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led in a recent poll</a> (though, notably, a full quarter of voters in that poll were undecided). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Lake has actually been the <em>less</em> extreme candidate between the two when it comes to an issue more important to voters: abortion. Masters spent the primary advocating for a national “personhood law,” which typically means a full ban on abortions nationwide, and <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2022/09/21/politifact-senate-candidate-blake-masters-backs-15-week-arizona-abortion-law-with-no-rape-incest-exceptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has supported</a> a federal 15-week abortion ban bill introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham. Since winning the primary, Masters has removed the “personhood” language from his website and <a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/elections/decision/amidst-changing-website-attack-ads-blake-masters-reiterates-his-stance-on-abortion/75-b84518d9-505f-4d50-9a1b-0fafcf2928ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said he supports</a> a federal ban on third trimester abortions. Lake says she is pro-life, but her <a href="https://www.karilake.com/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion platform</a> focuses on support for people who are pregnant and access to birth control, not addressing abortion bans. When asked directly about bans, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1554913738289037312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1554913738289037312%7Ctwgr%5E1a76fbc2dacded870689446f9b661bfb33c8e9f0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azcentral.com%2Fstory%2Fopinion%2Fop-ed%2Fej-montini%2F2022%2F08%2F04%2Fabortion-katie-hobbs-stance-solid-and-kari-lake-squishy%2F10236018002%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake has dodged the question</a>. Toss in the fact that, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/us/politics/kari-lake-arizona-republican.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after two decades</a> on local TV as a newscaster, Lake enjoys a generous dollop of name recognition, and the puzzle pieces start to come together. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We can also see something like this reflected in that AARP poll: Among Republicans, Lake is extremely popular, attracting 88 percent of likely GOP voters (Hobbs similarly has 94 percent support from Democrats), but Masters lags behind, drawing just 80 percent of likely Republican voters. Republican likely voters view Lake more favorably, too, at 80 percent favorability compared to Masters’s 71 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whichever way you slice it, Masters is coming up short where Lake is prevailing, and it’s clear her more extreme election stances haven’t stopped her from strongly contending against her Democratic opponent. While candidates like Masters are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/us/politics/election-deniers-trump-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easing away from</a> the Trumpiest rhetoric after securing their nomination, Lake may yet prove that you can still win while embracing an extreme position. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Sept. 30, 2022, 2:36 p.m.): </strong>This story has been updated to clarify that Katie Hobbs has a 52-in-100 chance of winning the Arizona governor’s race and Kari Lake has a 48-in-100 chance, not that they are projected to win 52 percent and 48 percent of the vote, respectively.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The last few weeks have been tumultuous for the issues of climate change and immigration. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/09/15/hottest-summer-august-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Record-setting summer temperatures</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/15/americas-extreme-summer-weather-of-2022-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic floods</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/how-climate-rapid-intensification-revved-up-ian-quicktake-l8klznxs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devastating hurricanes</a> have raised the stakes for the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/24/inflation-reduction-act-could-cut-climate-damages-by-1point9-trillion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate-change provisions</a> contained within the Inflation Reduction Act. Meanwhile, Republican governors in Florida and Texas <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-immigration-ron-desantis-charlie-baker-4fe96d293de4b189299a372b85c95add" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have attracted media attention</a> for paying to transport migrants and asylum seekers to liberal areas of the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These two issues aren’t obviously linked, but they have one major commonality: They rank among the most partisan in the United States. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/11/25/u-s-public-views-on-climate-and-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Those on the left care a great deal</a> about climate change, while <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/09/08/republicans-and-democrats-have-different-top-priorities-for-u-s-immigration-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those on the right are more likely to identify</a> immigration and border security as an important issue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In light of recent developments in both these areas, we decided to focus the fifth wave of our <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a> on climate change and immigration. Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we’ve been asking the same group of about 2,000 Americans what they feel are the country’s most important issues. In our latest poll, “inflation or increasing costs,” “crime or gun violence” and “political extremism or polarization” continued to appear on Americans’ list of most important issues, as they’ve ranked among the top three in each wave of our survey since we began polling in late April. But climate change (20 percent) and immigration (19 percent) were next in our most recent wave, as the chart below shows.<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted Sept. 6-19, 2022, among 1,564 respondents. As was the case in the previous waves of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple-choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. The sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

Overall, 36 percent of Democrats and just 5 percent of Republicans ranked climate change as a top issue facing the country. Conversely, 38 percent of Republicans and 6 percent of Democrats cited immigration as a top concern. This split has appeared consistently across all five waves: In each, 21 percent to 36 percent of Democrats have named climate change as a top issue, and 32 percent to 38 percent of Republicans have said the same of immigration. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When it comes to climate change, Americans are divided by party on more than simply its importance. When asked how much of climate change is caused by humans, 88 percent of Democrats and just 35 percent of Republicans said that it was “entirely” or “mostly” caused by humans, with independents between the two at 65 percent.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independents included respondents who identified as “independent” or “something else,” or who skipped the question for party identity. Respondents were also given the options of “barely” or “not at all” caused by humans, “don’t know” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> When asked whether the U.S. should pass regulations related to climate change that were “more strict,” “less strict” or “about as strict as they are today,” 76 percent of Democrats, 43 percent of independents and only 17 percent of Republicans wanted stricter regulations.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were also given the option of “don’t know” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And when asked to choose between two approaches to dealing with climate change, 89 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of independents supported prioritizing changes today that would reduce the effects of climate change before they happen, while 57 percent of Republicans preferred adjusting to climate change as it’s happening to minimize disruptions to daily life. Willie Yelverton, a 50-year-old Black man from Pennsylvania who identified as a Democrat, told us that even seemingly mundane changes would be important to reducing the impact of climate change. “[The government will] need to institute standard issue tax breaks for reusable materials,” he said. “There’ll have to be bans on goods that don’t have a path to be recycled and or reused going forward. Those are small line items, but it’s a very tough pill to swallow.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, we did find more agreement across party lines when it came to legislative action to address climate change. We asked Americans whether they supported three climate-change measures <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/what-the-inflation-reduction-act-does-for-green-energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included in the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which became law last month (we asked this without referring to the Inflation Reduction Act by name). As the chart below indicates, Americans across the political spectrum were at least somewhat receptive to them.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were classified as in support of these three proposals if they said they “strongly support” or “somewhat support” a proposal. Respondents could also say that they “somewhat oppose” or “strongly oppose,” or that they were “not familiar” with a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Many support Inflation Reduction Act climate change proposals" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0Riuu/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="347" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, more than 60 percent backed each of the three proposals, which included an increased emphasis on developing and using alternative energy sources, increased government regulation on corporations’ carbon emissions and giving tax credits to corporations that reduce carbon emissions. This included a majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents, too, save for increasing government regulation of business’ carbon emissions — although a plurality of Republicans still backed this idea (47 percent). Despite decently strong support for these proposals, Americans were largely unfamiliar with the Inflation Reduction Act, with only 38 percent stating that they were “very” or “somewhat” familiar with it.<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options included “heard of, but that is about it,” “never heard of,” or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also found that, regardless of party, a respondent’s concern about climate change related to whether he or she had experienced unusual climate events. Republicans displayed a striking worry gap based on experience: Forty-six percent of those who had encountered extreme weather in the past five years said they were worried about climate change, compared with just 17 percent who hadn’t (a gap 8 percentage points larger than the one seen among Democrats, who already had a majority of respondents express worry about climate change independent of their experiences).<a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme weather includes events such as extreme heat or cold, large wildfires, excessive rain, snow or drought. Respondents could select “yes,” “no,” “don’t know” or skip the question. Respondents were considered worried if they selected “very” or “somewhat” worried. They were also given the options of “not very worried,” “not at all worried,” “don’t know” or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a> A 61-year-old man from Florida who identified as a person of color and a Republican said he had recently experienced an extreme weather event, noting particular concern over “the obvious destruction of natural resources due to excessive heat, diminished water reserves and unusual number of heat domes impacting climate across multiple continents.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-feel-about-republican-governors-sending-migrants-to-blue-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media spotlight hovering over immigration</a>, partisan divides toward immigration should also come as little surprise. When we asked if rules surrounding <em>legal</em> immigration should become “more strict,” “less strict” or “remain about the same,” a plurality of Republicans (43 percent) preferred stricter rules, while 36 percent preferred the status quo, and 12 percent backed looser regulations (the remainder didn’t know or skipped the question). By comparison, only 11 percent of Democrats favored more restrictive rules, with 73 percent split evenly between wanting things to remain about the same or become less strict. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Republicans were more unified on the issue of illegal immigration, as 78 percent said they wanted stricter rules toward those entering the country without proper authorization, compared to just 24 percent of Democrats who said the same. Michael Ritchie, a 27-year-old white man from Texas who identified as a conservative-libertarian independent, told us he wanted the government to incentivize legal immigration and disincentivize immigrants entering the country without legal permission. “I don't think there can ever be enough boots on the ground, per se, to completely secure the border,” he said. “But creating new policies or revamping immigration policies that would keep people from coming here simply for free rides or anything like that, but also make it easier for people to come here legally.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That aligns with another finding in our poll: Among the 1 in 5 respondents who named immigration as a top issue facing the country, 95 percent said undocumented immigration was a bigger issue for the country, compared with just 1 percent who said legal immigration. “The federal government abandoned its duty to protect our borders. The flow of immigration outside the proper process is a symptom that anything can cross it without control,” said a 41-year-old Hispanic man from New York who identified as Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And unlike the policy ideas to tackle climate change, Americans were more split on the best ways to address immigration concerns. When we asked whether respondents supported or opposed five immigration-related proposals, the only one that received majority support was the U.S. accepting more refugees from Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Americans are split on immigration" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/68w0R/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="398" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as we’ve <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/09/19/most-americans-express-support-for-taking-in-refugees-but-opinions-vary-by-party-and-other-factors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seen in other polls</a>, Americans view refugees differently based on where they’re from, as only 45 percent overall wanted to accept more refugees from Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Republicans were far and away most supportive of expanding the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico (80 percent) and further restricting the number of visas given out (62 percent), while solid majorities of Democrats opposed these ideas (75 percent and 60 percent, respectively). Outside of supporting an increase in Ukrainian refugees and opposing the building of a border wall between the U.S. and Canada, independents were split pretty evenly on these proposals. </p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not as if these issues stand apart from each other. A 24-year-old multiracial woman from California who identified as a Democrat said, “[Climate change] will have such a large impact on America’s future, yet it’s turned into a ‘political issue’ with so much disinformation being spread. People are refusing to make the changes necessary to reverse climate change because of politicians who tell them lies.” Others tied immigration to issues such as health care. “Illegal immigration is a burden on the health care, judicial, education, etc. systems in the U.S. Even legal immigration hurts the U.S. with overpopulation,” said a 63-year-old white man from New York who identified as a Republican. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And how these issues motivate or persuade voters to back one party or the other will be of vital importance when voters go to the polls in November. With fewer than six weeks until the midterms, 46 percent of respondents told us they were certain or almost certain to vote, up from 42 percent back in the first wave in the spring. And among those likely voters, Democrats and Republicans are about evenly split on the generic ballot, with 41 percent saying that they plan to vote for a Democrat and 40 percent planning to vote for a Republican (which is within the margin of error). Still, 17 percent of likely voters told us they intended to vote for a third-party option or didn't know how they planned to vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Based on their highly partisan nature in today’s political environment, climate change and immigration may not immediately jump out as issues that help undecided voters make up their minds. But we’ll get a firmer answer to this question next month, when we take a closer look at which issues voters are thinking about the most when they cast their ballots. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">With about a month before the midterm election, some Republican candidates across the country are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/republicans-tried-sidestep-issue-abortion-now-seeking-reset-rcna47415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrambling to moderate</a> their position on abortion. Supporting the recent Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — which overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the constitutional right to abortion — might be a winner in a Republican primary, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/2022-live-primary-election-race-results/2022/08/02/1115317596/kansas-voters-abortion-legal-reject-constitutional-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early signs</a> are that it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes it harder</a> to win a general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The conventional wisdom is that that’s in part because women <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/25/upshot/female-voters-dobbs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more motivated</a> to vote this election season thanks to the Supreme Court’s ruling. Conventional wisdom isn’t necessarily based on evidence, though. And while abortion is an increasingly important issue for women, there are signs it is galvanizing some men too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the Dobbs decision were motivating more women than men, then there’s a metric where that change would probably show up: <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the gender gap</a>. The gender gap is calculated by looking at the difference between the share of men and women who voted for a particular candidate or party. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-won-the-right-to-vote-100-years-ago-they-didnt-start-voting-differently-from-men-until-1980/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A higher share of women than men</a> have voted for Democrats in every midterm election since 1980, and in the past two midterm cycles the gap has been even bigger. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2018 midterm elections are a good example. That year, according to the exit polls, 59 percent of women — and only 47 percent of men — voted Democratic, which means the gender gap was historically wide, at nearly 12 percentage points.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It will be hard to exceed that gap, even with abortion at the forefront of many voters’ minds. Our analysis of polls conducted between June and September suggests that, yes, women are leaning heavily toward Democrats, while men are more likely to support Republicans. But in our polling average,<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 24.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the size of the gender gap will vary depending on the poll. We looked at two Pew Research Center polls — one conducted in August 2018 and one in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/23/midterm-election-preferences-voter-engagement-views-of-campaign-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 2022</a> — and found that, in contrast with our average, the gender gap for Democrats among registered voters was a little wider in 2022 (6 points) than it was at the same point in 2018 (5 points), although it’s in the same ballpark. And it is noteworthy that Pew’s data says the 2022 gender gap is looking similar to the gap at the same point in 2018, given that Democrats have more electoral headwinds this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I expect that the [Supreme Court] ruling will lead women — especially Gen-Z women — to be far more engaged with the midterms than they would have been otherwise,” said <a href="https://www.melissadeckman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melissa Deckman</a>, the CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit polling organization. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the gender gap is a measure of one fairly specific thing: how women vote <em>relative</em> to men. And that can be complicated when it comes to abortion, because men and women overall have very similar views on the issue. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-dividing-line-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we’ve written before</a>, whether someone supports or opposes abortion rights has much more to do with their view of gender roles than their own gender. It’s possible, for example, that if left-leaning men are also unusually motivated to turn out, the gender gap could be smaller. A similar dynamic happened in 2020, when <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-gender-gap-may-have-shrunk-in-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">men moved toward President Joe Biden</a>, resulting in a smaller gender gap compared with 2016. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, the evidence about how men are responding to the Dobbs ruling is mixed. Over the past few months, polls have found <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-july-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/support-for-legalized-abortion-grows-since-dobbs-ruling-wsj-poll-shows-11662210020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over</a> again that rising concern over abortion is most dramatic among women, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/07/1121427463/more-women-are-registering-to-vote-how-could-that-affect-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> of surging voter registration have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/20/roe-abortion-dems-voter-registration-00057618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused on women</a>. <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/node/408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly Dittmar</a>, a political science professor at Rutgers University-Camden, said this makes sense because women — in particular, reproductive-aged women who support legal abortion — are more likely than men to feel personally threatened by the sudden loss of abortion rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there have also been reports of higher-than-usual voter registration among young men. An analysis of a series of polls by the nonpartisan firm PerryUndem,<a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted using YouGov’s online panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>33</sup></a> shared with FiveThirtyEight, before and after the Dobbs ruling found that men of reproductive age were more likely to prioritize “safe and legal abortion” as a voting issue. In our polling average,<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> we found that the gender gap for both Democrats and Republicans grew from June through September, but the gap grew more for Republicans than for Democrats. The two gaps are lopsided because men’s share of support for Democrats has grown as well as women’s, which means that the full magnitude of the shift doesn’t show up in that party’s side. Meanwhile, the shift in the Republicans’ gender gap shows something different: While the share of men supporting Republicans hasn’t changed meaningfully since June, the share of women supporting Republicans has declined, causing the gap to increase.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.fdu.edu/profiles/daniel_cassino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Cassino</a>, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, said that abortion-rights opponents might also be fired up by the Dobbs decision — but that’s less likely to show up as a change in the polls because those people are a solid part of the Republican base and more likely to vote in midterm elections to begin with. “This year, motivating those [anti-abortion voters] doesn’t really help Republicans, because they’re already motivated,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">He explained that reports of higher-than-usual voter registration among women and young voters are another complicating factor because it’s hard for pollsters to account for unexpected surges in turnout. Young voters tend to have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/645223716/on-the-sidelines-of-democracy-exploring-why-so-many-americans-dont-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly low turnout</a>, and pollsters sometimes rely on how demographic groups have behaved in the past <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2016/01/07/measuring-the-likelihood-to-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when they create models</a> to determine who’s likely to vote and who isn’t. If young women are unusually motivated to vote this year, that could throw off pollsters’ estimates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And then there are all the other factors that influence how people vote. Inflation and the economy <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/395408/abortion-moves-important-problem-list.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are other issues</a> that still consistently show up at the top of voters’ priority lists, and that’s not good for Democrats. Even though the economic outlook has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/13/business/economy/us-economy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved in some respects</a> over the past few months, <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_Politics_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202209021321.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll</a> found that only 26 percent of Americans said that Democrats would do a better job handling the economy, while 39 percent said Republicans would do a better job. (An additional 20 percent said that neither party would do a better job, and 12 percent said they’d do an equally good job.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So the question isn’t just whether abortion is motivating women more than men — it’s whether concern about abortion will lead voters who might be skeptical about the Democratic Party to vote for its candidates anyway. That group includes men as well as women, and their decisions will do a lot to shape how wide or narrow the gender gap turns out to be.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When Rep. Kurt Schrader, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-oregon-portland-congress-kurt-schrader-0bce17b40f80f96950358b5c4ee1862e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven-term incumbent</a> endorsed by President Biden, lost his primary in May, he joined a small but slowly growing list of congressional veterans defeated by progressive candidates with the backing of an increasingly influential campaign apparatus on the left. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This renewed progressive movement emerged following Sen. Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential primary run, yet despite some <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/historic-upset-28-year-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-unseats/story?id=56188380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile wins</a> in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-ayanna-pressleys-upset-win-in-massachusetts-isnt-really-like-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a>, its candidates <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-establishment-is-beating-the-progressive-wing-in-democratic-primaries-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost more often than they won</a> due to a scattershot strategy. Then, in 2020, when progressives <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got more targeted with their electoral strategy</a>, their win rate increased. But in 2022, the progressive movement appears to have taken a small step back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight tracked every endorsement made by a major progressive group for Senate, House and governor this primary season. We consider a candidate “progressive-backed” if they were endorsed by Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or any of the following groups: <a href="https://indivisible.org/candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indivisible</a>, <a href="https://justicedemocrats.com/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Democrats</a>, <a href="https://www.ourrevolution.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>, the <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunrise Movement</a> or the <a href="https://www.boldprogressives.org/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progressive Change Campaign Committee</a>.<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some of these groups have local chapters, we counted only the candidates endorsed by national organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> We also looked at candidates backed by various groups and leaders representing the more moderate or establishment wing of the Democratic Party and found that, overall, the Democratic establishment has an edge in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/26/ohio-11thdistrict-primary-turner-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle for the party’s soul</a>. </p>



<h4><strong>Incumbents largely staved off progressive challengers</strong></h4>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eleven candidates endorsed by at least one of those progressive organizations or people went into the 2022 election cycle hoping to topple an incumbent.<a data-footnote-id="35" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-35" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes two who were incumbents themselves, Reps. Marie Newman and Andy Levin. New congressional maps threw them into the same district as their fellow Reps. Sean Casten and Haley Stevens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>35</sup></a> Only one of them won: Schrader’s opponent, attorney Jamie McLeod-Skinner. By contrast, in 2020, progressives won three out of 17 such battles.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of these races, one of the most closely watched was in Texas’s 28th Congressional District, where progressive attorney Jessica Cisneros took on Rep. Henry Cuellar for the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/05/jessica-cisneros-henry-cuellar-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second time</a>. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/24/jessica-cisneros-henry-cuellar-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuellar is a long-time moderate in the party</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/texas-primary-candidates-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an opponent of abortion rights</a>. In 2020 Cisneros came within 4 percentage points of unseating him. Cisneros and her supporters were looking to replicate the success of Rep. Marie Newman, who defeated eight-term Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in 2020 after she lost to him by 2 points in 2018. (Lipinski also opposed abortion rights.) But despite all seven progressive entities we tracked being in her corner, Cisneros came up short: After forcing a runoff, she lost to Cuellar by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/21/henry-cuellar-jessica-cisneros-south-texas-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 289 votes</a>. (Newman is out this cycle too. She lost to fellow incumbent Rep. Sean Casten.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Incumbents’ myriad advantages help them <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">win primaries most of the time</a>. For one, they (usually) have the support of party leadership. For instance, in the race between Cisneros and Cuellar, Cuellar was endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn and House Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries. And while Biden does not typically issue primary endorsements as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-endorsees-have-started-losing-more-but-dont-read-into-that-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his predecessor did</a>, the president made <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Endorsements_by_Joe_Biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three exceptions for House candidates this cycle</a>, all for incumbents facing progressive primary challengers: Schrader and Reps. Shontel Brown and Danny Davis. Schrader lost, but both Brown and Davis prevailed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Races like these that pit a progressive against an establishment Democrat are watched closely as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-16/oregon-congress-primary-democrats-schrader-mcleod-skinner-left-vs-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referenda on the future direction of the party</a>. And among more moderate Democrats, progressive losses are seized upon to suggest that the party’s base is still pro-establishment — or at least satisfied with the status quo. For instance, Jeffries, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-house-incumbents-challengers/2021/07/13/5dad62a4-e327-11eb-8aa5-5662858b696e_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a known critic of the progressives in his party</a>, was asked in August if he thought the progressive movement had stopped gaining ground. <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/08/hakeem-jeffries-again-challenges-left-eve-primary/376162/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He responded</a>, “Politically, the left did have some success in primarying Democratic incumbents in 2018, and 2020 … But a lot of their electoral momentum began to dissipate shortly after Biden was elected … Perhaps the voters are sending us a message.”</p>



<h4><strong>Progressives had more luck in open-seat races</strong></h4>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jeffries’s analysis ignores that progressive-backed candidates do much better in primaries without an incumbent on the ballot. For example, in 2022, the progressive-backed candidate won 14 out of the 25 open-seat primaries in which they ran — good for a 56 percent win rate. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And some of these were pretty big wins. For instance, after Rep. Mike Doyle announced his intention not to run for reelection in Pennsylvania’s safely Democratic 12th Congressional District, most progressive groups lined up behind state Rep. Summer Lee. As a result, Lee edged out Doyle’s chosen successor by less than 1 point. Likewise, in Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race, progressive-backed Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes was such a formidable candidate that his closest rivals could not gain traction and <a href="https://www.wpr.org/once-competitive-race-wisconsins-democratic-u-s-senate-primary-all-decided" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out one by one</a>. That eventually led to his primary coronation (though it remains to be seen whether he will win the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general election in November</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, progressives also won fewer of these primaries than they did in 2020. That year, their win rate in incumbent-less primaries was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a robust 69 percent</a> (22 wins in 32 tries). Part of the decline could be because of the emergence of a well-funded opposition mobilizing against them. For example, progressives endorsed two congressional candidates in North Carolina, former state Sen. Erica Smith and Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam, who failed to win their primaries. In both those elections, the same foe stepped up to block them: the <a href="https://businessnc.com/new-aipac-money-boosting-don-davis-valerie-foushee-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Democracy Project</a>, a pro-Israel super PAC funded by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The United Democracy Project spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00799031/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $24.3 million</a> this election cycle helping to elect moderate Democrats over progressives, with their biggest outlay coming on behalf of former Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Glenn Ivey over former Rep. Donna Edwards in Maryland’s 4th Congressional District.<a data-footnote-id="36" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-36" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Edwards is ideologically progressive, interestingly, none of the seven progressive entities we tracked endorsed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>36</sup></a> The super PAC’s efforts were not always successful — it also spent heavily against Lee, for example — but it did win more races it got involved in than progressives did: seven out of nine, or 78 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, progressives’ win rate was far lower than the win rate of candidates supported by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official House campaign arm of the Democratic Party. All 18 candidates who were put on the DCCC’s “<a href="https://redtoblue.dccc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red to Blue</a>” list before their primaries advanced to the general election.<a data-footnote-id="37" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-37" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Governors Association does not endorse in open-seat primaries, and in a departure from past practice, nor did the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, the party went head-to-head against progressives only once: in New York’s 11th Congressional District, where former Rep. Max Rose defeated Army veteran Brittany Ramos DeBarros. Ramos DeBarros was endorsed by Indivisible, Our Revolution and the PCCC. In fact, 13 of the DCCC’s Red to Blue candidates faced no Democratic opposition in their primaries. This is a good reminder that progressive and establishment candidates aren’t necessarily in opposition. </p>



<h4><strong>Different progressive groups have different strategies</strong></h4>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also important to remember that not all progressive groups are the same. Some groups and leaders still see the value in endorsing a longer-shot candidate with little chance of winning to influence agenda-setting or remind more establishment candidates that their party’s tent is big. Others, by contrast, are more strategic, hoping to funnel their resources into the races they feel they have the best chance of winning. As a result, certain progressive endorsers have better records than others. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, Justice Democrats have a 100 percent win rate in incumbent-less primaries (three for three), up from 67 percent in 2020 (two for three) and a marked improvement from 2018 (32 percent), when they endorsed more broadly (50 candidates). As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we wrote in 2020</a>, of all the progressive groups emerging since 2016, Justice Democrats, in particular, seem most targeted in their recruitment efforts and deliberate about their endorsements, which helps explain their success. Ocasio-Cortez (three for four) and the Sunrise Movement (three for five) also succeeded with limited endorsement strategies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the progressives who were a bit freer with their endorsements, Sanders did the best with an 80 percent win rate in incumbent-less primaries (eight for 10), up from 75 percent in 2020 (six for eight) and 56 percent in 2018 (five for nine). This could reflect Sanders’s status as the godfather of the party’s progressive wing, but given the growth in his <em>own</em> win rate, it could be the product of a shrewder endorsement strategy. Finally, the PCCC was the only progressive endorser we looked at with a losing record (36 percent, or four for 11).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 primaries continued to display all the factors working against progressives — factors that have kept the soul of the Democratic Party fairly establishment-friendly. But it’s also important to remember that progressives are playing the long game. They may not have won as often as their opponents. Still, many <em>did</em> win their primaries and will join a growing number <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/greg-casar-summer-lee-delia-ramirez-house-progressives-1389261/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already on the inside</a>. It may not be a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congressional-republicans-left-office-in-droves-under-trump-just-how-conservative-are-their-replacements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sudden transformation</a>, but progressives are slowly gaining strength within the Democratic Party with every passing election cycle.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">A president’s approval rating is traditionally tied to how his party performs in a midterm election, but Democrats have been outpacing President Biden in the polls for months. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses how Biden’s approval rating may impact the midterm election and how the Democrats’ performance in November could influence the president’s 2024 reelection plans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The team also debates whether <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/22/midterm-elections-immigration-abortion" target="_blank">tracking Google search terms over time</a> is a better barometer than traditional polling when it comes to understanding the issues shaping American voting patterns. Lastly, politics reporter Alex Samuels and visual journalist Elena Mejía break down <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank">their reporting</a> on how Black voters are changing the political landscape of Georgia.</p>
