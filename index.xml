			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The idea that Americans are tired of the pandemic has become conventional wisdom, with important policy implications. Democratic governors in blue states like New Jersey and California have <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/2/11/22904377/democrat-governors-pandemic-mask-mandates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled back mask mandates</a>, citing the importance of “normalcy.” But is “normal” what Americans really expect? And what does “normal” even mean, anyway?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_013122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent Monmouth University poll</a> found that 70 percent of Americans agreed with the statement, “It’s time we accept that Covid is here to stay and we just need to get on with our lives.” This poll got a lot of attention — it was featured in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/us/politics/covid-restrictions-americans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a><em>, </em><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/592102-large-majority-say-its-time-to-just-accept-covid-19-as-part-of-life-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill</a> and other outlets, and was even discussed in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-americans-exhaustion-with-covid-19-is-shaping-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent episode of FiveThirtyEight’s Politics podcast</a>. It’s not an outlier, either. <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Tables-Wave-103.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Feb. 11-13 poll from Harris</a> found that 71 percent of Americans agreed with the statement, “We will be living with COVID in some form forever.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, most Americans believe COVID-19 will persist into the near (or distant) future, but what that means to people’s daily lives is the subject of much more dissent. That’s because understanding COVID-19 as an ongoing reality means something different to everyone. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For some, it means going back to pre-pandemic life, without mask mandates, vaccine requirements or other public health measures to contain the spread of the virus. But that’s not what it means to most, according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Feb. 4-7 Axios/Ipsos poll</a>, in which just 21 percent of Americans said we should “get back to life as usual with no coronavirus mandates or requirements.” To be sure, 29 percent thought we should move toward that goal with some precautions, while 23 percent wanted to mostly keep precautions in place and 21 percent wanted to increase precautions. Part of the reason opinion is so divided is that Americans are simultaneously ready <em>and</em> not-ready to go back to pre-pandemic life. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vtm70v61hq/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over three-quarters of Americans</a> said they were “ready to return to normal”, according to a Feb. 12-15 poll from The Economist/YouGov. And yet the Axios/Ipsos poll showed that <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-02/Topline_Axios_Ipsos%20W62%20FINAL_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent thought</a> doing so posed a large or moderate risk.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What Americans want regarding COVID-19 is all over the place. And there’s only so much the polls can tell you. For instance, they can’t list <em>every</em> public health response to COVID-19, much less every combination of responses. But polls show that support is shifting more toward individual precautions than toward COVID-19 protections mandated for society at large.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Americans seem to be OK with being more cautious in their personal decisions. That is, they’re more willing to undergo measures like mask-wearing or vaccinations for themselves, though they may not want to institute it as a requirement. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/09/increasing-public-criticism-confusion-over-covid-19-response-in-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Jan. 24-30 poll</a> from the Pew Research Center, 73 percent of Americans were fully vaccinated, but just 58 percent supported requiring proof of vaccination to fly. And Americans were even less supportive of requiring vaccines for the four other activities Pew asked about — attending a sporting event or concert (53 percent), going to college in-person (52 percent), eating inside a restaurant (46 percent) and shopping inside a store (40 percent). In fact, overall support for vaccine mandates may be declining. Americans were 3 to 5 percentage points more supportive of requiring vaccines for these activities when Pew polled about this in August 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for mask mandates is mixed. In the aforementioned Harris poll, 55 percent of Americans <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Tables-Wave-103.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly or somewhat agreed</a> that it was time to lift indoor mask mandates. But the Monmouth poll found that 52 percent supported statewide mask and social-distancing guidelines, though this figure is down from 55 percent in December and from 63 percent in September. Likewise, according to Axios/Ipsos, support for local and statewide mask mandates in all public places <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-02/Topline_Axios_Ipsos%20W62%20FINAL_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to fluctuate inside a somewhat narrow range</a> of 60 percent to 67 percent, with the greatest support roughly correlated to the peaks of the delta and omicron waves. But one thing is clear: Even if Americans <em>are</em> backing mask mandates less, most still say they would wear a mask indoors. The Harris poll also found that 69 percent of Americans were at least somewhat likely to keep wearing masks indoors now that indoor mask mandates were being lifted, and for those living in places with mask mandates, 58 percent said they would continue to occasionally mask up once those requirements were removed, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vtm70v61hq/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to The Economist/YouGov</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason support for vaccine and mask mandates may be falling is that the public simply doesn’t trust the government to handle the pandemic correctly. Approval ratings for hospitals’ and medical centers’ responses to COVID-19 were still very high, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/09/increasing-public-criticism-confusion-over-covid-19-response-in-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Pew</a>, but approval ratings for President Biden, public health officials and elected officials in state and local governments all declined by double digits since March 2020. In fact, Pew found a significant decline in the approval rating for state elected officials, from a high of 70 percent in March 2020 to a low of 46 percent in January 2022. This may be why governors in particular are pushing for a return to normal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pew also found that shifting public health guidelines have led to an increasing share of Americans who feel confused or less confident in public officials’ recommendations. They also just <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996331692/poll-finds-public-health-has-a-trust-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust public health officials less</a> than they used to. After almost two years of dealing with the pandemic, Americans may trust their own decision-making more than guidance from the government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gone, too, are the days of declaring a “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/biden-declares-war-on-covid-t7n5r3hgm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-scale wartime effort</a>” until the virus is “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-covid-fourth-of-july/2021/07/04/13afcc66-dcc2-11eb-9f54-7eee10b5fcd2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanquished</a>.” Instead, there’s more acceptance among Americans that the pandemic is probably here to stay in some form. What this means, though, has been the subject of so much debate that it’s unsurprising that so many Americans are uncertain about what actions should be taken on a broader scale to address the pandemic. Regulating their individual actions — and expressing their discontent — may really be the only thing under their control.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The COVID-19 pandemic has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/great-resignation-may-be-altering-workforce-dynamic-for-good.html">reshaped the workforce</a>, with many workers quitting their jobs to seek other opportunities, but Americans still think employers have the upper hand. According to a Feb. 5-8 poll from The Economist/YouGov, Americans thought that employers had “a great deal” or “a lot” of <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/economy/articles-reports/2022/02/15/who-do-americans-think-has-more-leverage">leverage in the labor market</a> (43 percent), versus workers (20 percent) — even though many Americans (47 percent) believed the pandemic increased the bargaining power of workers. (Another 34 percent said it had no effect and 18 percent said that it increased the power of employers.)</li><li>Health care workers <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/16/health-care-workers-pandemic-response-polling/">give themselves, their coworkers, their employers and hospitals high marks</a> when evaluating their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Jan. 31-Feb. 11 Morning Consult/Axios poll. Eighty-nine percent said they strongly or somewhat approved of how health care workers had handled the pandemic, compared with 83 percent for their coworkers, 79 percent for employers and 78 percent for hospitals. But similar to other Americans, health care workers were dissatisfied with how the pandemic was handled by the Biden administration (just 44 percent approved) and the American public (34 percent approved).</li><li>More Americans are growing dissatisfied with current levels of immigration in the U.S., but that’s because Republican dissatisfaction <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389708/dissatisfaction-immigration-level-rises.aspx">hit a record high of 87 percent</a>, an increase of 32 percentage points from last year, according to a Jan. 3-16 poll from Gallup. That large spike among Republicans is to be expected — immigration is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/">an increasingly partisan issue</a>, and the GOP tends to disagree with how Democratic presidents handle the issue.</li><li>There were also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/02/16/publics-top-priority-for-2022-strengthening-the-nations-economy/">sharp partisan divides</a> surrounding what Americans believe the federal government’s biggest priorities for 2022 should be, according to a Jan. 10-17 survey from the Pew Research Center. The greatest differences were in dealing with climate change (65 percent of Democrats cited this as a top priority, versus 11 percent of Republicans) and COVID-19 (80 percent for Democrats, 35 percent for Republicans). But Americans of all political stripes viewed strengthening the economy as the most important issue overall, with 71 percent saying it should be a top priority (although that is a decline of 9 percentage points from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/01/28/economy-and-covid-19-top-the-publics-policy-agenda-for-2021/">last year</a>).</li><li>Overwhelming majorities of Republicans want a presidential candidate <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-republicans-disloyalty-opinion-poll-02-2022/">who shares former President Trump’s views</a> on policy issues (84 percent), the COVID-19 vaccine (78 percent) and the 2020 election (70 percent), according to a Feb. 8-11 poll from CBS News/YouGov. But their opinion on Trump’s personal conduct is more mixed. Just 54 percent said they want someone who comports themselves similarly to Trump. That said, Republicans still favor Trump running again: 69 percent said he should run again in 2024, with 70 percent of that group saying he would be the best Republican candidate.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">In recent months, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60201752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news reports</a> in the U.K. revealed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson attended parties in government buildings while Britain was in strict COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. His approval rating has now sunk to <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/boris-johnson-approval-rating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 percent</a>, and it’s unclear if he’ll hang on to his leadership position. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politics podcast</a>, two hosts of the British “<a href="https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talking Politics</a>” podcast, <a href="https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/Staff_and_Students/professor-david-runciman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Runciman</a> and <a href="https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/Staff_and_Students/dr-helen-thompson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helen Thompson</a>, discuss why the British public and some members of the Conservative Party have soured on Johnson in a way that American Republicans never soured on President Trump, despite Trump’s numerous scandals. They also reflect on how British and American politics changed during the period when Brexit and Trump dominated the two countries’ news cycles and consider their lasting impact.</p>

			<category>The Big Lie</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The aftermath of the 2020 presidential election was probably most Americans’ introduction to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state who rebuffed then-President Donald Trump’s entreaties to “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/trump-demands-georgia-elections-official-overturn-his-defeat-in-hourlong-call/6MRGK445JNAGHBL2HXLZ3FIVZU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find 11,780 votes</a>” that would allow him to carry the state. Same with Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/08/texas-ken-paxton-election-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a baseless lawsuit</a> to get the Supreme Court to throw out 60 of then-President-elect Biden’s electoral votes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Secretaries of state and state attorneys general have <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2016/10/how-to-rig-election-2016-secretary-of.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always been influential</a> within <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2014/10/ag-order-2014-race-ratings-for-attorney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their own states</a>, but the attempted abuse of these offices to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election has finally awakened the rest of the country to their importance. As a result, campaigns for these offices that flew under the radar in 2014 (when Paxton was first elected) and 2018 (when Raffensperger was) have been thrust into the national spotlight here in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, 27 secretaries of state and 30 attorneys general will be elected nationwide (other states either elect them in other years or don’t elect them at all). And since the secretaries of state and attorneys general who are elected in 2022 will wield power in 2024, this year’s elections could plunge our democracy into further danger if would-be election subverters win them.</p>



<h2><strong>Secretary of state</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the ones who oversee the administration of elections and the certification of results in most states, secretaries of state play a fundamental role in our democracy. And given their discretion to interpret and implement election laws in ways that either make it <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-93094-529536--,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easier</a> or <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2018/10/19/georgia-voter-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder</a> to vote, they’ve already drawn a lot of attention for 2022: Candidates for the office are raising <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/candidates-top-election-posts-fundraising-record-setting-pace/story?id=82199309" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record sums of money</a>, Trump has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personally pushed</a> to install loyalists in three key states, and incumbents who otherwise might have sailed to an uncontroversial reelection are now facing rabid primary challenges.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The list of secretary of state elections to watch starts with <strong>Georgia</strong>, where Raffensperger first faces a tough primary from Rep. Jody Hice. While Raffensperger has made it clear there was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/weve-found-systemic-fraud-overturn-election-georgia-secretary/story?id=74560956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no election fraud in Georgia</a> and that Biden won the state, his challenger Hice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted against the certification</a> of the 2020 election in the House. He also continued to baselessly claim that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/politics/jody-hice-georgia-elections-secretary-of-state-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of thousands of potentially fraudulent votes</a> were cast and that Trump, in fact, carried Georgia. (He didn’t.) Hice isn’t the only election denier in the race, though: Former Alpharetta Mayor David Belle Isle has claimed there were “<a href="https://www.thegeorgiavirtue.com/2022-georgia-election/sos-candidate-launches-video-series-to-look-at-2020-election-irregularities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irregularities</a>” in the 2020 election, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s still early, but Hice looks like the primary front-runner. Through the end of January, he has <a href="http://capitol-beat.org/2022/02/hice-nguyen-leading-battle-for-bucks-in-race-for-georgia-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $1.6 million</a> to Raffensperger’s $597,000 and Belle Isle’s $376,000, and he has the golden ticket in any GOP nomination fight: <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/hice-launches-challenge-to-raffensperger-in-race-for-secretary-of-state/IBLOYKCCNFBOTN5FCSEM5PMBAA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>. But his path to the secretary of state’s office is not clear in this newly minted swing state. Whichever Republican emerges from the primary will then face a tough general election against the well-funded ($1.1 million raised so far) Democratic state Rep. Bee Nguyen in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump and his allies aren’t just targeting their fellow Republicans, though. Democratic secretaries of state who spent the 2020 election cycle expanding voting access are in the crosshairs, too. The most vulnerable Democrat is likely Jocelyn Benson of <strong>Michigan</strong>. And unlike in most states, her Republican challenger will be chosen at a <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/16/michigan-gop-sets-early-convention-declines-vote-hand-count/8149133002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party convention</a>, not a primary, which could lead to a more radical nominee who appeals to party diehards. That’s good news for college professor Kristina Karamo, who has <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/07/donald-trump-backs-michigan-election-critic-secretary-state/5758348001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Karamo became a right-wing celebrity when she claimed she witnessed fraud as a poll watcher in the 2020 election, and she has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/16/politics/kristina-karamo-michigan-secretary-of-state-candidate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">espoused conspiracy theories</a> such as that Trump actually won Michigan and that the Jan. 6 rioters were actually members of antifa. Other Republicans in the race have more conventional resumes for the state’s chief election official: state Rep. Beau LaFave, Chesterfield Township Clerk Cindy Berry and Plainfield Township Clerk Cathleen Postmus. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans are also hoping to flip control of the <strong>Arizona</strong> secretary of state’s office, but there, Democratic incumbent Katie Hobbs isn’t running for reelection, leaving a crowded field of hopefuls to replace her. Former Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes (who used to oversee elections in Arizona’s most populous county) and state House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding are the two Democratic candidates and the only two candidates in the race who have acknowledged Biden’s victory as legitimate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the four Republicans in the race, meanwhile, two have tried to overturn the 2020 election results. State Rep. Shawnna Bolick, for instance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/backers-trumps-false-fraud-claims-seek-control-next-us-elections-2021-09-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed onto a resolution</a> that urged Congress to award Arizona’s Electoral College votes to Trump, and she also <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/06/22/shawnna-bolick-author-of-bill-to-reject-voters-presidential-choice-running-to-be-top-elections-official/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a bill</a> that would have allowed the legislature to revoke the certification of presidential elections in the state,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill died in committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> although she has argued that she wasn’t part of the “Stop the Steal” movement. Meanwhile, state Rep. Mark Finchem signed onto the same resolution as Bolick and <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/06/02/mark-finchem-was-much-closer-to-the-jan-6-insurrection-than-he-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 insurrection</a>. Finchem, who has <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/09/13/trump-endorses-mark-finchem-arizona-secretary-state-election/8322839002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>, also has ties to the <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-legislators-to-speak-at-qanon-conference-in-las-vegas-11884331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAnon conspiracy theory</a> and has identified as a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republican-state-lawmakers-white-nationalists-rslc-silent_n_5bcd82e4e4b0a8f17eee0a1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member of the Oath Keepers</a>, a far-right anti-government militia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The two other GOP candidates, advertising executive Beau Lane and state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, have <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/blog/ad-agency-exec-beau-lane-joins-gop-primary-for-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined to say</a> whether the 2020 election was illegitimate, but Ugenti-Rita has voted like she thinks it was. She sponsored multiple <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1003/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting</a> <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1485/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictions</a> that passed the legislature last year, and she initially supported an unfounded <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/post-election-audits-are-normal-whats-happening-in-arizona-is-anything-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan audit</a> into the 2020 election results in Maricopa County (although she later <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-gop-ugenti-rita-withdraws-support-audit-calls-botched-2021-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned against it</a>, complaining it had been “botched”). Ugenti-Rita has other baggage as well: A lobbyist has accused her of making <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/02/05/lobbyist-details-harassment-claims-involving-arizona-senator-michelle-ugenti-rita-brian-townsend/4647264002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwanted sexual advances</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Nevada</strong>’s secretary of state post is also open following the retirement of Republican Barbara Cegavske, who was <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2021/04/12/nevada-gop-censures-barbara-cegavske-defending-election-results/7192091002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censured by the state GOP</a> for her insistence that the 2020 election was not fraudulent. Trump himself has not yet weighed in on the <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/2020-election-fraud-conspiracy-theories-remain-central-to-many-republican-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP primary here</a>, but if he does, he’ll probably back former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, who wants to conduct an Arizona-style “audit” into Nevada’s results and attended an election-fraud conference put on by businessman and Trump ally Mike Lindell. Another <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/reno-developer-former-state-senator-jesse-haw-to-run-for-secretary-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-funded Republican candidate</a>, former state Sen. Jesse Haw, says on his <a href="https://www.jessehawnv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign website</a> that Nevada’s liberal voting laws “have made it easier to cheat.” However, there is one pro-democracy Republican running: Sparks City Councilman Kristopher Dahir. Dahir has said he does not believe the 2020 election was stolen and has praised Cegavske’s leadership. There’s also a competitive primary on the Democratic side between Cisco Aguilar, a staffer for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and former state Assemblywoman Ellen Spiegel.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are four of the biggest secretary of state races in which democracy is on the line in 2022. But there are a couple of dark-red states where the Republican primary (as the de facto general election) could have huge consequences for democracy as well. The incumbent secretaries of state of both Idaho and Alabama are retiring, and the primaries to replace them have become referenda on the legitimacy of the 2020 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, in <strong>Idaho</strong>, there are three candidates vying to replace outgoing Secretary of State Lawerence Denney. Phil McGrane, who runs elections in Idaho’s biggest county, has said that Idaho’s elections are <a href="https://magicvalley.com/opinion/columnists/malloy-state-s-election-system-is-sound/article_932fc81d-7cc8-5865-b979-77a08af0d689.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally secure</a>. But state Sen. Mary Souza has pointed to “<a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2022/01/24/introducing-each-candidate-who-is-running-secretary-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weaknesses</a>” in Idaho’s election laws, while state Rep. Dorothy Moon last year <a href="https://wendyrogers.org/update-146-legislators-from-38-states-write-a-letter-to-the-american-people-calling-for-a-50-state-audit-decertification-where-appropriate-and-possible-convening-of-the-us-house-of-representatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a letter</a> calling for an “audit” into the election results in all 50 states along with the decertification of the 2020 election if necessary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, the candidates to succeed <strong>Alabama</strong> Secretary of State John Merrill include one experienced election administrator and multiple pro-Trump election deniers. Ed Packard, who worked in the secretary of state’s elections division for more than 24 years, maintains that there is <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/02/spotlight-shines-on-alabama-secretary-of-state-race-as-views-over-2020-election-and-trump-loom-large.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence of widespread voter fraud</a>, whereas state Rep. Wes Allen <a href="https://twitter.com/RepWesAllen/status/1336791872426086403?s=20&amp;t=gy33vMUpIdo2jNAGXdA0UA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> Texas’s lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election and Alabama Auditor Jim Zeigler has said there is “preliminary information” to suggest there were “strange voting returns” in some counties. </p>



<h2><strong>Attorney general</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">They may not be responsible for the administration of elections, but as their states’ “top lawyers,” state attorneys general provide legal advice and representation for government agencies and officials, investigate crimes and otherwise work to ensure that the state’s laws are being enforced. In the past year, this has meant a lot of wading through — and in some cases initiating — claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In total, we’ve identified five attorney general elections in which claims of election fraud have been a significant issue, ranging from Texas, whose <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/texas-sues-georgia-to-try-to-overturn-election-results/EVEDMTX2J5E2DJ3O6FOGMDS7PM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general led the charge</a> to overturn election results, to Wisconsin, where neither Republican candidate has explicitly claimed that Trump won in 2020 but have nonetheless made election fraud a significant part of their platforms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The most controversial state attorney general right now is likely <strong>Texas</strong>’s Ken Paxton, who is mired in election-related disputes as well as two different criminal investigations. As we said at the outset, Texas was at the forefront of attempts to overturn the 2020 election result, in large part thanks to Paxton’s baseless lawsuit to block the results in four states Biden had won. Trump <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/26/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-2022-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Paxton</a> last July, but he’s also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-louie-gohmert-endorse-opponent-texas-attorney-general-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praised Rep. Louie Gohmert</a>, who <a href="https://abc13.com/louie-gohmert-lawsuit-mike-pence-biden-electoral-count/9284409/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed his own lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election</a> and is now challenging Paxton for attorney general. There are two other Republican candidates in this race: George P. Bush, the Texas land commissioner and son of 2016 candidate (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/05/06/477077226/jeb-bush-wont-vote-for-trump-i-cannot-support-his-candidacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/12/jeb-bush-trump-should-stop-tweeting-focus-on-agenda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequent</a> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/26/jeb-bush-warns-trumps-character-may-drag-down-gop-2018-elections/1067795001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/jeb-bush-trump-qanon-praise-dee2dc47-1db1-4d1f-bae9-fa88bff6dd85.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critic</a>) Jeb Bush, and former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Bush is the only candidate to <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/554119-george-p-bush-says-2020-election-wasnt-stolen-but-would-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have rebuffed claims</a> that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump; Guzman hasn’t said anything publicly about it but has said she would welcome <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/21/texas-eva-guzman-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s support</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the scandals Paxton finds himself in — he faces felony charges from <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/06/19/ken-paxton-criminal-case-timeline-texas-attorney-general-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2015 securities fraud case</a> when he was a member of the Texas Legislature and is also the subject of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/criminal-investigations-dallas-ken-paxton-coronavirus-pandemic-crime-3657864db01b3e2525f53f8f523af316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate FBI investigation</a> over allegations that he engaged in bribery and other crimes while attorney general — the most recent polling of the race shows <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/new-poll-shows-tx-ag-paxton-staring-down-runoff-race-abbott-well-ahead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paxton leading the pack, with 47 percent</a> of the vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Kansas</strong>, meanwhile, the attorney general election is wide open after incumbent Derek Schmidt <a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-dwight-eisenhower-kansas-legislation-coronavirus-pandemic-87542690cbd10047f1e557f7eb5ff57f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to run for governor,</a> creating an opening for <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-kansas-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the GOP’s most vocal proponents of election fraud</a>: former Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Notorious for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/19/621304260/judge-tosses-kansas-proof-of-citizenship-voter-law-and-rebukes-sec-of-state-koba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a controversial law</a> he championed as secretary of state that required residents prove their citizenship before registering to vote, Kobach is now mounting his third bid for statewide office despite two previous unsuccessful attempts — he first <a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/political/laura-kelly-topples-kris-kobach-in-kansas-gubernatorial-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in the 2018 gubernatorial race</a> and then lost to <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article244717957.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then-Rep. Roger Marshall in the 2020 Senate GOP primary</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s likely Kobach’s failure to win these recent elections that has attracted competition in this primary, despite his Trump bona fides. (He hasn’t claimed the 2020 election was fraudulent, but <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/12/07/kobach-texas-case-challenges-election-directly-at-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he did write an op-ed in the conservative media outlet Breitbart</a> in support of Paxton’s lawsuit.) Meanwhile, both state Sen. Kellie Warren, who launched her campaign with <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/07/06/kellie-warren-joins-kris-kobach-kansas-attorney-general-race/7872788002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a thinly veiled dig</a> at Kobach, and former prosecutor Tony Mattivi are running against him. Neither Mattivi nor Warren have spoken publicly about whether they dispute the results of the 2020 election, instead focusing more on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-health-senate-elections-election-2020-616fd7663ffd5cfa25b698b7126d98f9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging the Biden administration</a> on issues like vaccine mandates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>Idaho</strong>, it’s a question of whether Republican incumbent Lawrence Wasden, who has defended the 2020 election result, will survive a primary challenge. Lawrence broke with <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/529614-18-states-join-texas-case-seeing-to-overturn-biden-win" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a dozen Republican attorneys general</a> when he <a href="https://www.ag.idaho.gov/newsroom/wasden-issues-statement-on-texas-election-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in December 2020</a> that he wouldn’t be joining Texas’s effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election result. That, in turn, precipitated <a href="https://cdapress.com/news/2020/dec/12/coeur-dalene-attorney-art-macomber-considered-atto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a primary challenge</a> from attorney Art Macomber, who said he was inspired to run when Wasden didn’t join the suit; Dennis Boyles, <a href="https://www.idahoednews.org/kevins-blog/wasden-will-seek-re-election-joins-crowded-a-g-s-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another attorney in the state</a>; and <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/11/17/raul-labrador-launches-attorney-general-campaign-appoints-treasurer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Rep. Raúl Labrador</a>, Wasden’s only challenger with any political experience. But all of these challengers likely face a steep climb to the nomination — Wasden is the <a href="https://www.naag.org/attorney-general/lawrence-wasden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longest-serving attorney general</a> in Idaho’s history, having served for nearly 20 years. And with the exception of <a href="https://archive.sos.idaho.gov/ELECT/results/2002/primary/tot_stwd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his first primary in 2002</a>, he’s handily defeated all subsequent opponents by double-digit margins. That said, both Labrador and Macomber <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/12/10/more-than-1-6-million-already-raised-in-idaho-campaigns-for-statewide-offices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have outraised Wasden</a>, which is a favorable sign for their campaigns.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in <strong>Michigan</strong>, it’s another case of a pro-democracy Republican pitted against proponents of the Big Lie in the GOP primary. At this point, however, <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/politics/2022/01/12/poll-dana-nessel-has-edge-in-re-election-bid-for-michigan-ag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling shows</a> incumbent Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel with a small lead over her two main Republican challengers, former Michigan Speaker of the House Tom Leonard and attorney Matt DePerno.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As is true in Michigan’s secretary of state election, GOP convention-goers will <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/09/michigan-gop-plots-shift-statewide-nomination-process-amid-fight-over-future/7915760002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately decide who the nominee</a> is, not primary voters. And if Leonard wins the nomination, the 2022 election will be a rematch of 2018, which Nessel won by just 3 percentage points. He is also the only Republican running who has said <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-attorney-general-nomination-race-could-test-trumps-hold-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there isn’t any evidence</a> that the election results were invalid. DePerno is polling worse against Nessel than Leonard, but it’s close, and his endorsement from <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/16/trump-endorses-michigan-election-challenger-deperno-attorney-general/8371724002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> may sway some delegates. DePerno has also been a vocal proponent of the claim that Trump’s election loss was fraudulent, even <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/07/attorney-accused-of-pushing-false-election-fraud-claims-wants-to-be-michigans-next-attorney-general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filing a lawsuit in Antrim County</a> alleging that the voting machines used in the election were compromised (the suit was ultimately dismissed). Finally, state Rep. Ryan Berman is also running as a Republican who backs the Big Lie — he <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2020/12/10/gop-lawmakers-hide-from-questions-about-trumps-quest-to-overturn-the-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed onto a letter</a> in late 2020 that raised allegations of election fraud and asked for an independent audit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another state that Democrats are defending is <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, where incumbent Democrat Josh Kaul faces two Republican challengers, who haven’t backed the Big Lie but who have still made “election security” a big part of their platforms: Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney and former state Assemblymember Adam Jarchow. Toney, for instance, has tried to build a name for himself as the district attorney who has prosecuted the most cases of election fraud in the state. (Toney has prosecuted <a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-attorney-general-race-could-decide-fate-of-fraud-allegations-against-wisconsin-elections-commissioners/article_0bec141e-2866-5a5d-9f1a-af7cb688172b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven of 10 cases</a>, the most of any Wisconsin district attorney.) Meanwhile, Jarchow <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamforAG/status/1492202669934628873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has attacked Kaul</a> for insufficiently investigating allegations of election fraud, although he hasn’t gone as far as to question the 2020 presidential result. It’s early yet, but at this point both Jarchow and Toney <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/15/adam-jarchow-takes-more-month-than-eric-toney-raised-year/6791141001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are behind Kaul’s</a> fundraising; Kaul had over $1 million ready to spend in his campaign account at the end of December, while Jarchow and Toney have each raised between $80,000 and $100,000.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">But of course, these are only some of the highest-profile offices on the ballot in 2022 that could impact the 2024 election. Since it’s still early in the campaign, races for secretary of state and attorney general in other states could become hotly contested over the next few months. And a lot of the nuts and bolts of administering a free and fair election are hammered out on the county level, where there are <a href="https://boltsmag.org/whats-on-the-ballot/local-election-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countless more election officials</a> getting elected this year. So while it’s frighteningly difficult to know how likely it is that the 2024 election will actually get overturned, it’s definitely possible that, after 2022, the pieces will be in place to do so.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When President Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law last March, he funded federal programs designed to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and provided a third round of stimulus to Americans. But the bill also provided $350 billion in aid sent directly to states, counties and local governments to spend as they saw fit. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was an almost unprecedented amount of money. According to an analysis from <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/06/28/how-far-american-rescue-plan-dollars-will-stretch-varies-by-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pew Charitable Trusts</a>, states received aid equivalent to anywhere from 4.9 percent (Wisconsin) to 22.7 percent (Wyoming) of their spending in the previous fiscal year. Most states have a legal obligation to balance their budgets, which means unexpected surpluses like this are rare. But combined with previous coronavirus response bills and spending packages, the federal government has now spent <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/disaster/covid-19?publicLaw=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $5 trillion</a> addressing the pandemic, money that will flow through communities over the next decade and change the funding landscape in states and cities across the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">States are awash with cash.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not clear yet where all this money will go — states have an enormous <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amount of leeway</a> as to how they’ll spend it and until 2026 to do so. (In total, <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/how-states-can-best-use-federal-fiscal-recovery-funds-lessons-from" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$155 billion went out to states</a> in 2021, with the rest due to be distributed later this year.) Most states have used the windfall of cash to address the budget problems caused by the economic downturn following the pandemic and to address the inequities thrown into sharp relief during the past two years. But while there are broad commonalities in how states have spent the money, it’s also true that how relief from the pandemic is defined varies widely — not necessarily across partisan lines but in ways that are still shaped by local conditions and ideology.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These differences are more apparent after drilling down past broad categories of funding. In Oklahoma, for example, Gov. Kevin Stitt <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2021/05/17/unemployment-oklahoma-1200-workers-governor-kevin-stitt-economy/5130077001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended the enhanced unemployment benefits</a> available to many workers during the pandemic, and used some of Oklahoma’s American Rescue Plan money last spring for $1,200 bonuses to the first 20,000 workers who stopped collecting unemployment and started working full time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other states combined back-to-work bonuses with <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMmQ2NDRiNDYtN2NkZC00OTE2LThjYzQtYjAzNTE2ZDRjZWFiIiwidCI6IjM4MmZiOGIwLTRkYzMtNDEwNy04MGJkLTM1OTViMjQzMmZhZSIsImMiOjZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader workforce development packages</a> that included bonus pay for essential workers who’d worked through the pandemic and job retraining programs. Meanwhile, Vermont used <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/ACTS/ACT009/ACT009%20As%20Enacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 million</a> <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/ACTS/ACT009/ACT009%20As%20Enacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of its recovery plan</a> money to provide free classes at state colleges to workers who wanted to change careers, and Washington state used almost $169 million <a href="https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5092-S.PL.pdf?q=20210426164608" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to help pay for its paid leave program</a>. While there are variations from state to state, they will determine the recovery landscape for millions of Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that there is so much federal money flowing doesn’t change local politics, said Ed Lazere of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that has been tracking and analyzing how states are allocating their relief money. “In many cases it is shaped by what the values of the policymakers were beforehand.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, there are broad trends in how states are spending the money: Almost every state that has allocated money so far has spent some on broadband, water and sewer infrastructure, which was one of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big spending categories determined by Congress</a>.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A formula taking into account states’ unemployment rates and lost revenue from lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions determined how much aid states received, whether they received it all at once, and whether they could use it to replace lost tax revenue, and so the stimulus picture looks different in every state. Some states received all of their money at once and have already allocated it all, while a handful of states — South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, Mississippi and South Carolina — are &lt;a href="https://yallpolitics.com/2021/06/15/mississippi-to-receive-1-8-billion-from-the-american-rescue-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;just starting&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2022/01/04/extra-meetings-planned-appropriations-committee-spending-requests-accumulate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;make determinations&lt;/a&gt; on it. (Additionally, another $122 billion went &lt;a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-distribution-all-american-rescue-plan-esser-funds-and-approval-all-52-state-education-agency-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;directly to school districts&lt;/a&gt;, which largely can determine how to spend it themselves. Funding for cities and counties also complicates the picture. A tiny fraction of money allocated to municipalities — less than 0.3 percent of the total funds available, according to a 15-state study from the &lt;a href="https://www.nlc.org/article/2022/01/03/data-finds-small-municipalities-declining-arpa-slfrf-funds-is-rare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National League of Cities&lt;/a&gt; — was declined, but the rejections could have stemmed from logistical reasons rather than ideological ones.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a></p>

Within states, this has meant a mix of new programs, funding for existing programs and expansion of broadband services to more rural areas where the lack of access to reliable, fast internet made it harder for some children to attend virtual school during lockdowns. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Infrastructure has also been a big priority for states like Florida, which is <a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/globalassets/dem/recovery/american-rescue-plan-act/florida-recovery-plan-for-sfrf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending money on highways and other transportation projects</a> that had been long-planned but unfinished. Lazere said some of the need for infrastructure goes all the way back to the Great Recession, which began in 2007, and the long, slow recovery that followed. “These were areas of need that had not been addressed, [for which] there hadn’t been a dedicated state or federal funding source, so the rescue plan gave them the opportunity to tackle these problems that had been around for a long time,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, because the funds are a large, one-time payment, with no expectation that they’ll continue into the future, it encourages spending on infrastructure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It really starts with states doing that analysis, to be able to know what’s affordable over the long-term and what’s not,” said Josh Goodman, who is part of The Pew Charitable Trusts’s state fiscal health project.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But because the categories in which states are allowed to spend the money are so expansive, and the money is given without many strings attached, the kinds of projects states plan to spend the money on also reveals local political priorities and political philosophies. Broadly, states are allowed to replace revenue lost during the pandemic, and how local lawmakers define those challenges and decide how to address them varies widely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Alabama, $400 million will be used for building two new prisons. New correctional facilities for the state had been one of Gov. Kay Ivey’s priorities; <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/01/alabama-gov-kay-ivey-calls-for-gas-tax-new-prisons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/02/alabama-will-build-3-prisons-for-men-ivey-announces-do-not-publish.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she announced plans</a> for three prisons that were ultimately scrapped. But the state has been under a court order to improve mental health care in its prisons <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/documents/the_opinion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2017</a>, and advocates of the new law say using the recovery funds to build a new prison will address those problems, as well as overcrowding and inadequate staffing. They also say the new facilities will improve the overall health care and mental health care available to incarcerated individuals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The proposal passed <a href="https://abc3340.com/news/local/alabama-house-votes-to-use-400-million-from-american-rescue-plan-act-to-build-prisons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a special legislative session in September</a>. In the state House, the vote passed along party lines, with Republicans all in favor and most Democrats against, but in the state Senate it received broader support and only one Democrat voted against it. The House Democrats’ objections, along with criminal justice reform advocates in the state, are that building a new prison absent other reforms won’t solve the criminal justice system’s problems, and that the funds could have been spent on more urgent needs revealed by the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two dozen Alabama groups <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2021/12/21/organizations-challenge-use-of-covid-relief-funds-to-build-prisons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a letter</a> to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee asking for an investigation of Alabama’s use of the funds for building the prisons. “Building more prisons is a gross misuse of funds that were sent to help the people of Alabama, not punish them,” JaTaune Bosby, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, <a href="https://www.aclualabama.org/en/press-releases/alabama-organizations-call-us-house-financial-services-committee-halt-use-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in the letter</a>. But the state has argued the use falls within guidelines, and has plans to move quickly on construction. In a <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/01/31/alabama-2022-legislative-report-first-special-session/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special session last month</a>, the state also moved to allocate most of the rest of the funds to water and sewer infrastructure, broadband, and unemployment insurance tax breaks for businesses.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In more liberal states and localities, lawmakers are pursuing new financial assistance programs for local families. One idea that has picked up steam is funding <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/phoenix-approves-universal-basic-income-program-for-1000-families-12052702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guaranteed</a> <a href="https://iecam.illinois.edu/news/chicago-approves-guaranteed-basic-income-pilot-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">income</a> <a href="https://www.newarknj.gov/news/guaranteed-income-pilot-program-expands-to-400-newark-residents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pilot programs</a>, with eligible residents receiving between $500 and $1,000 in cash assistance monthly. Support for these programs <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-28/the-u-s-cities-giving-residents-direct-cash-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been growing across the ideological spectrum</a>, especially in the last few years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Madeline Neighly, who directs the guaranteed income program at the Economic Security Project, said there are currently over 60 cities involved in planning guaranteed income projects, using a mix of public funds from the American Rescue Plan and private funds. (Some programs were already in the works, and the ARPA funds are just a new potential revenue source.) And the state of California will itself <a href="https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2021/07/universal-basic-income-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend $35 million launching guaranteed income programs</a> statewide over the next five years. The money was allocated when Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/12/california-roars-back-governor-newsom-signs-100-billion-california-comeback-plan-to-accelerate-states-recovery-and-tackle-persistent-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed the state budget into law</a> last summer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Neighly said the previous pandemic relief bills helped build awareness and increased interest in launching such projects. “We saw the power of cash during the pandemic,” she said. “We saw it with the stimulus checks and the expanded child [tax] credit.” She said guaranteed income could work in concert with many of the other programs states are launching to rebuild their economies. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The impact this money will have will become even more apparent as the funds work their way into communities and start touching individual lives. Overall, though, the unprecedented amount of money is an opportunity for states to reimagine and reinvent their local economies, which could mark an important shift after two years of responding to emergencies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Lazere, the biggest takeaway is that states are all using the money, and will continue to do so as the next payments are dispersed this year. So far, no states have rejected the money outright. “What we’re hoping for and looking for is not just states plugging this money into budget holes, but actually deliberately using it to strengthen public health and the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic,” he said. “We are looking for states to use the money in ways that really set them up for a robust recovery.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">For days now, there have been reports that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/russia-ukraine/?id=82467772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia could attack Ukraine at any moment</a>, although it’s possible <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/14/world/russia-ukraine-news#as-russian-forces-menace-ukraine-western-leaders-continue-an-urgent-diplomatic-effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued diplomatic talks</a> could avert military conflict. Russia is <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-possible-invasion-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking concessions</a>, such as a promise from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that Ukraine <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-putin-nato-invasion-demands-rcna9116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will never be allowed to join the coalition and/or</a> reductions in NATO’s <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-urges-de-escalation-as-scholz-visits-moscow-for-putin-talks/6442259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">troop presence and missile deployment</a>. But as <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/03/27/a-brief-history-of-nato-from-truman-to-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the leading nation in NATO</a>, the United States must now grapple with how it will help protect its allies, many of whom are located near Russia, while managing its relationship with Ukraine, which has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/war-with-russia-has-pushed-ukrainians-toward-the-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become closer to the West in recent years</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In light of these challenges, President Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/politics/biden-zelensky-call/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has promised</a> further <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/22/ukraine-russia-military-weapons-nato-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Ukraine</a>, but <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060406.214132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. public opinion may affect</a> just how far his administration is willing to go to aid the beleaguered nation. As with many foreign policy issues, Americans don’t necessarily have well-established views on how the U.S. should respond, and in some cases their attitudes are mixed. For instance, polls suggest Americans would prefer to avoid becoming heavily involved in the conflict, but many support taking Ukraine’s side against the Russians. There is also a significant amount of variation in how and to what degree Americans want to assist Ukraine as well as a number of partisan- and age-related divisions over potential American responses. Those splits might reflect broader views on the country’s role in world affairs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked about the U.S. position in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Americans at first glance prefer to remain above the fray. In a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-u-s-involvement-opinion-poll-02-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov survey</a> conducted last week, 53 percent of Americans said the U.S. should stay out of the situation by siding with neither Ukraine or Russia in ongoing talks, while 43 percent said the U.S. should back Ukraine (only 4 percent wanted to side with Russia). A <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/557651509/20220207-Yahoo-Tabs-Ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo News/YouGov poll</a> conducted earlier in February found a similar split, with 49 percent of respondents wanting to avoid taking sides and 46 percent preferring to back Ukraine (just 5 percent said Russia). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the same poll, Americans demonstrated how their views on the larger geopolitical situation are muddled: When asked which of two statements came closer to their opinion, 40 percent said it was in the U.S.’s best interest to stop Russia and help Ukraine, compared with 33 percent who said the conflict was “none of America’s business” (although a sizable 27 percent said they didn’t know which position was closer to their view).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the mixed opinions on the broad contours of American foreign intervention, some of these questions also exposed partisan and age differences in public attitudes. For instance, in both surveys, about 3 in 5 Democrats preferred supporting Ukraine over staying out or backing Russia, while about half of Republicans and more than half of independents preferred to support neither country. But while Americans under 45 <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to be more Democratic-leaning</a>, they were more likely to say the U.S. should support neither country — or that they weren’t sure — while older Americans felt more strongly that the U.S. should support Ukraine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The age splits could reflect lingering anti-Russian views among older Americans who remember the Cold War. Polling from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/npwlx2cq4r/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov last week</a> found that about half of Americans ages 45 or older viewed Russia as an “enemy” of the U.S., while only around a quarter of those under 45 said the same. The divide may also reflect <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/the-clash-of-generations-and-american-foreign-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the skepticism</a> that many young Americans have toward American military intervention, as many came of age during the lengthy and troubled wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked about specific policy ideas, though, more Americans than not tend to favor providing assistance to Ukraine through diplomatic or economic means. Last week, 50 percent of Americans told The Economist/YouGov that it was a good idea to implement economic sanctions against Russia — including 50 percent of Republicans and 59 percent of Democrats — while only 20 percent viewed this as a bad idea. That was the most popular policy The Economist/YouGov asked about, but pluralities of slightly more than 40 percent also said allowing Ukraine to join NATO and sending Ukraine financial aid were good ideas, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And polls suggest that Americans look askance at Russian diplomatic demands: 58 percent told Yahoo News/YouGov that Putin’s desires for NATO to withdraw from Eastern Europe and bar Ukraine from joining NATO were unreasonable, compared with 12 percent who said they were reasonable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, economic sanctions and aid for Ukraine are still more popular, too, than military-based interventions. It’s true that <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/08174124/2202035_crosstabs_GEOPOLITICAL_RISK_UKRAINE_RVs_v2_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult found last week</a> that registered voters were about evenly split on whether the U.S. should send weapons to Ukraine’s government while the U.S. continues to seek a diplomatic solution with Russia, with 41 percent supporting the move and 42 percent preferring to not send weapons. But a solid plurality, 49 percent, opposed sending additional troops to Eastern Europe while talks with Russia were ongoing, compared with 36 percent who supported doing so. Moreover, there was <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/10/americans-support-sending-troops-to-russia-in-only-one-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just one scenario</a> in Morning Consult’s polling where more respondents preferred deploying troops to Eastern Europe over imposing sanctions against Russia: If Russia invaded and occupied all of Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Americans may be open to sending troops to the region or even Ukraine proper. The U.S. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/11/russia-ukraine-us-troops-poland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has already deployed 3,000 more soldiers</a> to NATO defenses in nearby Poland, and sending troops to Eastern Europe but not Ukraine as part of a larger NATO operation did get support in Morning Consult’s poll. Similarly, 61 percent expressed support for sending troops directly to Ukraine as part of a NATO coalition, compared with only 37 percent if the U.S. acted on its own. And among American adults more broadly, a plurality (40 percent) said they supported sending troops to support NATO allies in the Economist/YouGov poll. On all these questions, older Americans had more favorable attitudes toward military assistance than their younger counterparts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear what will happen in Ukraine at this point, but for now more Americans support continued diplomacy or economic sanctions versus sending military assistance to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion. But Americans are also open to U.S. military action under some circumstances, and in such a volatile situation, public opinion could change quickly depending on what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Today’s Democrats <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-speak-vaccine-politics-center-stage-process/story?id=73047767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fancy themselves</a> <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/combating-fake-news-agenda-for-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the party</a> that trusts <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X17719507" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the evidence</a> — wherever it might lead. This is why they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/11/17/biden-covid-vaccine-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invest heavily</a> in science and technology and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up arms of government</a> to translate that knowledge into action. But despite claiming to prioritize new ways of improving our society, Democrats don’t always act in ways that are rooted in research. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, sometimes they <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/11/20/9764324/welfare-cash-transfer-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively resist doing what the evidence says</a> — especially when it comes to implementing policies that give financial benefits to people low on America’s societal totem pole. It’s not always said out loud, but the reality is that some Democrats, and American voters in general, do not think very highly of poor people or people of color — there are countless examples of how society is quick <a href="https://columbiasamclab.weebly.com/uploads/5/9/0/6/59061709/heiphetz_craig_in_press_oxford_studies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to dehumanize them</a> and how politicians struggle to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-is-unlikely-to-talk-meaningfully-about-race-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">address their needs</a> in a meaningful way. These <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2021.1971441?journalCode=hpli20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patterns of thinking</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/64/1/53/1818233?redirectedFrom=PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misleading portrayals</a> of marginalized people too often mean that the <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo3633527.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies that could help them most</a> are opposed time and time again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That opposition is, of course, rarely framed in terms of antipathy or animus toward a particular group. Instead, it is often framed as “rationality,” like adherence to “fiscal conservatism,” especially <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/the-long-game-of-republican-economics/547721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among members of the GOP</a>, who have long abided by small-government views. But some Democrats are really no different. Consider President Biden’s <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/in-the-news/student-loan-forgiveness-likely-wont-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reluctance to cancel</a> student loan debt, or the federal government’s hesitancy to provide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/us/politics/jill-biden-free-community-college.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free community college</a>, or West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s recent opposition to including the child tax credit in the Build Back Better plan, reportedly on the grounds that low-income people would <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-joe-manchin-suggests-child-tax-credit-payments/story?id=81865740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use the money on drugs</a>. Indeed, politicians across the political spectrum have found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/us/politics/email-political-misinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of scapegoats</a> to use while arguing against expanding the social safety net, including <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-are-afraid-of-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing to Americans’ fears</a> about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/inflation-definition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising inflation rates</a>. As a result, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various programs</a> that <a href="https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-by-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would help</a> people — namely <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/03/want-to-see-who-republicans-care-about-check-their-anti-poor-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the poor</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/many-blacks-hispanics-need-stimulus-checks-just-to-get-by-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people of color</a> — have become taboo.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s striking, though, is that if you actually look at most social science research, investing in the social safety net <em>is fiscally responsible</em> — it <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdep.12037?casa_token=8_TRwpa5f9EAAAAA%3Ao8NDn5VTyQNJwPPIn385n0b59xI390HDWC9IYIRnUeS-q9n4vuUgreRkWIfM7DrQDjrxphF9WpJqog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pays large dividends</a> for both individuals and our collective society. Economists have studied this for decades, finding that anti-poverty and <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers#TheWomensIncomeGeneratingSupportWINGSPrograminNorthernUganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cash-assistance programs</a> executed both in and outside of the U.S. are linked to <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers#TheWomensIncomeGeneratingSupportWINGSPrograminNorthernUganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased labor participation</a> <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/why-cash-assistance-essential-moving-americans-out-poverty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the workforce</a>, while <a href="https://jenni.uchicago.edu/papers/Heckman_Masterov_RAE_2007_v29_n3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investing in childcare</a> benefits not only children, but the broader economy and society they are raised in. Moreover, newer initiatives like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2022/01/24/a-regressive-student-loan-system-results-in-costly-racial-disparities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceling student debt</a> could <a href="https://educationdata.org/what-happens-if-student-loan-debt-is-canceled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add up to 1.5 million jobs</a> and lift over 5 million Americans out of poverty in addition to freeing many Americans of the debt trap that is contributing to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-says-student-debt-is-u-s-hurting-housing-market-11547657473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lagging housing market</a> and widening <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/why-biden-should-forgive-student-loan-debt/617171/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial wealth gap</a>. Other <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/05/18/student-debt-forgiveness-would-impact-nearly-every-aspect-of-peoples-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research suggests</a> that those saddled with student loan debt would be more likely to get married or have children if their dues were forgiven. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That is the evidence. Yet, rather than acting on it, there has been a tendency to highlight stories and tropes about people who might <a href="https://theconversation.com/3-myths-about-the-poor-that-republicans-are-using-to-support-slashing-us-safety-net-89048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waste the resources</a> invested in them. And that’s oftentimes enough to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Color-Welfare-Racism-Undermined-Poverty/dp/0195101227" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undermine public and political support</a> for these policies. So what we’re seeing from some “moderate” Democrats today is likely born out of an inherent distrust of what might happen if you just <em>give </em>people money or help them through an expanded social safety net. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if we look in the not-too-distant past — less than a hundred years ago, in fact — we quickly see that Democrats didn’t always oppose distributing money to support Americans’ well-being. In fact, former Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt rolled out safety-net programs like Oprah would give away her favorite things. In <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/heres-how-the-great-depression-brought-on-social-security-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">response to the Great Depression</a>, Roosevelt oversaw a massive expansion of the social safety net during the 1930s and ’40s, <a href="https://livingnewdeal.org/what-was-the-new-deal/programs/#:~:text=Federal%20Emergency%20Relief%20Administration%20(FERA)%20(1933),relief%20payments%20to%20the%20indigent.&amp;text=Created%20by%20Executive%20Order%20to%20fund%20state%20and%20local%20public%20works%20projects." target="_blank" rel="noopener">which included giving grants</a> to states that implemented unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children and funding to business and agriculture communities. Recognizing the importance of a safety net to protect people from “the uncertainties brought on by unemployment, illness, disability, death and old age,” the federal government also created Social Security, which it deemed vital at the time for <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic security</a>. And in the 1960s, long after the Great Depression was over, the government created <a href="https://www.nasi.org/learn/medicare/the-history-of-medicare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Medicare program</a> for similar reasons under former President Lyndon B. Johnson, another Democrat. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What is clear from these examples is that the federal government once understood the importance of a robust safety net for the health, well-being and the broader functioning of our society. The caveat, however, is that this general understanding does not extend to our thinking about <em>all </em>Americans; the government was supportive of these policies <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/article/left-out-policy-diffusion-and-the-exclusion-of-black-workers-from-unemployment-insurance/BB47A78FB42748203E43CBDF1AABE8F2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when most beneficiaries were white</a>. But when people of color started actively utilizing and benefitting from these same programs, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/07/clinton-era-welfare-reforms-american-poor-bernie-sanders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they became harder to attain</a> and, in some cases, overtly racialized. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was particularly true in the 1970s and ’80s when conservative and right-wing political candidates <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/josh-levin-the-queen-book-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vilified Americans on welfare</a>. During his initial presidential run, Ronald Reagan <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/05/21/she-was-stereotyped-welfare-queen-truth-was-more-disturbing-new-book-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would tell stories and give numerous stump speeches</a> centered on Linda Taylor, a Black Chicago-area welfare recipient, dubbed a “welfare queen.” To gin up anti-government and anti-poor resentment among his base, the then-future Republican <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/15/archives/welfare-queen-becomes-issue-in-reagan-campaign-hitting-a-nerve-now.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president villainized</a> Taylor, repeating claims that she had used “80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans’ benefits for four nonexistent deceased veteran husbands, as well as welfare” as a way to signal that certain Americans — namely those of color — were gaming the system in order to attain certain benefits from the federal government. Reagan wasn’t alone, however. In fact, his tough stance on alleged welfare fraud and government spending on social programs encapsulated <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/alevelstudies/1951-conservative-management.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the conservative critique</a> of big-government liberalism at the time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats, however, weren’t that different either. Former Democratic President Bill Clinton’s promise to “end welfare as we know it” in the 1990s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/the-end-of-welfare-as-we-know-it/476322/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included stipulations</a> like requiring a certain percentage of welfare recipients to be working or participate in job training. This helped foster, in turn, a belief that there were people who played by the rules <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/136200/racist-roots-welfare-reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and those who didn’t</a> (namely Black Americans). And once politicians started worrying about (Black) people taking advantage of the system, the requirements needed to acquire certain societal and financial benefits became <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11789988/clintons-welfare-reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even harder to obtain</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But all of this implicit rhetoric about reducing government waste by cracking down on marginalized people does not hold up to scrutiny when examining the evidence. The reality is that fraud among social safety net beneficiaries is <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/04/04/welfare-fraud-is-actually-rare-no-matter-what-the-myths-and-stereotypes-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely rare</a>, and much less costly to society than, say, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/26/wealthy-tax-evasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax evasion among the richest 1 percent</a>. Yet we spend an incredible amount of money trying to catch and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-mother-needed-welfare-instead-the-state-used-welfare-funds-to-take-her-son?s=09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penalize the poor instead of helping them</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, polls show that Americans — particularly Democrats — overwhelmingly want to expand the social safety net. According to a 2019 survey from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/12/17/views-of-the-economic-system-and-social-safety-net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, a majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaners (59 percent) and 17 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners said that the government should<em> </em>provide <em>more</em> assistance to people in need. Even this October, around the time when Democrats were negotiating the size of the omnibus Build Back Better Act, a <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/10/13/rel6a.-.biden.infrastructure.economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN/SSRS</a> poll found that 75 percent of the party’s voters (and 6 percent of Republicans) preferred that Congress pass a bill that expanded the social safety net and enacted climate-change policies. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, despite many Americans wanting an expansion of the social safety net, it is still often hard to sell voters on these programs — especially if they’re <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-an-ambitious-agenda-heres-what-they-should-learn-from-obamacare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrapped up in large policy packages</a> (i.e. Obamacare) or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25731135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with someone voters dislike</a> (i.e. former Democratic <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-obamacare-support-obama-approval-sink-to-new-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Barack Obama</a>). Consider that a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/11/democrats-cash-success-covid-relief-515765" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult</a> survey from late last year found that only 39 percent of Americans who received the child tax credit said it had a “major impact” on their lives. Moreover, only 38 percent of respondents credited Biden for the implementation of the program. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that many expansions of the social safety net aren’t initially popular makes it all the easier for Democrats to fall back on the stories people tell themselves about different groups of people and whether they deserve help. And sometimes, those portrayals affect <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2021.1971441?journalCode=hpli20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the concerns we have</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19401612211020929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about members of those groups</a> and the explanations we generate <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-abstract/36/6/1061/13467/Who-Deserves-Health-Care-The-Effects-of-Causal?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for why they experience the outcomes they do</a> in life. As earlier expansions of the social safety net show, the U.S. hasn’t always been allergic to giving people money, but there now seems to be this unspoken idea that poor people and people of color can’t be trusted to spend “free” money or government assistance well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This thinking, though, poses a problem for Democrats because, for years, they’ve branded themselves as the party that promotes general welfare by advancing racial, economic and social justice. At the same time, they continue to fall short on campaign promises to expand the social safety net despite many poor people, and people of color, having <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/08/stacey-abrams-believers-georgia-blue-434985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fought long and hard</a> to put them in office. The fact that so many of today’s Democrats are still prisoners to antiquated tropes about who gets — or is deserving of — government benefits is a dangerous one, because it causes people to push members of those groups outside of their “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-33813-003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moral circles</a>” — the circle of people that they think they have a moral obligation to help. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, breaking this chain of thought won’t be easy because it would require Democrats to break the long-standing mindset that poor people are in their current situation <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-abstract/36/6/1061/13467/Who-Deserves-Health-Care-The-Effects-of-Causal?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of a series of “unfortunate” choices</a>. It would also probably require them to stop worrying about how Republicans might falsely reframe social safety net programs as dangerous, especially given ongoing concerns regarding inflation and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. But at the end of the day, that shouldn’t matter: While the politics might not be immediately convenient and the effects of these programs not immediately seen, that is not necessarily a reason to defer implementing them. Focusing solely on the short-term effects <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-worry-a-lot-about-policies-that-win-elections-thats-short-sighted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not only short-sighted</a>, but dangerous. And Democrats stand to lose more than the support of their base if they refuse to act. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this month, the Republican National Committee <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rnc-vote-censure-cheney-kinzinger-roles-jan-committee/story?id=82671994" data-type="URL" data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rnc-vote-censure-cheney-kinzinger-roles-jan-committee/story?id=82671994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to censure</a> Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for serving on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, describing the inquiry as the “persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.” Some GOP lawmakers and elites criticized the resolution, while others defended it.

<p data-paragraph="main">They also talk about the causes of hyperinflation, as Democrats and Republicans point to different culprits for the highest rate of inflation in 40 years. Finally, they try to guess what Americans think about love and relationships in a Valentine’s Day-themed game.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the 2020 election, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rightward shift among Latino voters</a> raised eyebrows. <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post-election surveys</a> have disagreed about <a href="https://twitter.com/A_agadjanian/status/1385639388818788355?s=20&amp;t=FfUIkI1qjxs8eHqCV2e3fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the exact split</a> in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Latino vote</a>, but it appears around 3 in 5 (or slightly more) voted for President Biden over then-President Donald Trump. Yet many of those same surveys as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/20/us/politics/election-hispanics-asians-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precinct-level analysis</a> of the 2020 vote suggest that, compared with his performance in 2016, Trump made gains among Latinos — and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/13/south-texas-voters-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in some places</a>, quite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/21/us/miami-hispanic-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable ones</a>. Going forward, such swings among Latinos — <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest ethnic or racial minority group in the country</a> — could affect each party’s chance of carrying important states like Arizona, Florida and Texas while also putting Democratic-leaning turf <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in play for the GOP</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet for all the talk about Republicans making serious inroads with Latino voters, new data from Gallup suggests that Latinos’ lurch toward the GOP could be overstated, at least when it comes to how they identify with the two major parties. In Gallup’s survey data for 2021, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/389093/hispanic-americans-party-updated-analysis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pollster found</a> that 56 percent of Hispanic Americans identified as Democrats or as independents who leaned toward the Democratic Party, while 26 percent identified as Republican or as leaning toward the GOP. Those figures represent very little change from what Gallup found in 2020 and, as the chart below shows, largely fall in line with Hispanic party-identification data over the past decade.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Latinos continue to identify more as Democrats" aria-label="Interactive area chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EvCJJ/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s been really only one inflection point in Gallup’s Hispanic party-ID data, which came around 2015 and 2016, when the share of Hispanics identifying with the Democratic Party shot up to 62 percent, while the share identifying with the Republican Party fell below 30 percent. Perhaps not coincidentally, this coincided with Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, which was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-klinker-immigration-election-20170417-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly nativist</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-worries-rise-amid-hostile-trump-comments-on-latinos-and-muslims/2016/06/05/986545e8-2a1c-11e6-a3c4-0724e8e24f3f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hostile toward Latinos</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even still, those changes didn’t necessarily produce a big shift in electoral fortunes. In fact, in 2016, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-probably-did-better-with-latino-voters-than-romney-did/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump probably performed better</a> with the Latino electorate than Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had four years earlier. That’s partly because shifts in party ID may not actually be all that predictive of how Latino voters will ultimately vote. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Latinos are pretty swingy compared with other voting blocs, as they’re just not that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912919888577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attached to the two major parties</a>. Case in point: In Gallup’s 2021 polling, 52 percent of Hispanic Americans identified as independent, which was 10 percentage points higher <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the population as a whole</a> (42 percent). And when asked if they leaned toward one party, Latino independents were more likely to identify with the Democratic Party. But since most Latino Americans first identified as independent, this means that of the 56 percent who identified as or leaned Democratic, around two in five were actually independent leaners. (Among Republicans, almost three in five were independent leaners.) And while studies show that voters leaning toward a party do tend to back that party, <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.649.1442&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they are still more likely</a> to vote for the other side than voters who strongly identify with a party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And among Latinos, ties to the two parties may be particularly weak because they aren’t as likely as other Americans to form a strong partisan identity at a young age. For starters, about <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/09/key-facts-about-u-s-latinos-for-national-hispanic-heritage-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third of Latinos weren't born in the U.S.</a>, which means many haven't developed a strong allegiance to either party. As a result, many first-generation Latinos <a href="https://www.robertofcarlos.com/uploads/6/9/4/3/69439129/late_to_the_party_on_the_prolonged_partisan_socialization_process_of_secondgeneration_americans.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven't instilled loyalty to either party</a> in their children, which is often how younger voters in the U.S. form their partisan identities.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the various forces described here also affect other immigrant populations in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> It’s no surprise then that younger Latinos, in particular, hold only weak affinities for the two major parties or identify as independent, as they often have to find their own way politically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These looser partisan attachments mean that a sizable bloc of the Latino electorate is persuadable. This was <a href="https://equisresearch.medium.com/2020-post-mortem-part-one-16221adbd2f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the takeaways</a> from Equis Research’s post-mortem on the 2020 election, which found that <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/60668f2a28dee76b4ffebc73/1617334072783/Equis+Post-Mortem+Part+One+%28Public+Deck%29+%281%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump won over many Democratic-leaning Latino voters</a>. This was true both in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily Hispanic South Texas</a>, where the Democratic margin shrunk from 33 points in 2016 to just 17 points in 2020,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the vote totals in 28 counties along or near Texas’s border with Mexico: Brewster, Brooks, Cameron, Culberson, Dimmit, Duval, El Paso, Frio, Hidalgo, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kinney, Kleberg, La Salle, Maverick, Nueces, Presidio, Reeves, Starr, Terrell, Val Verde, Webb, Willacy, Zapata and Zavala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> and in Nevada, where 11 percent of Latino voters in Trump’s coalition had backed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to Equis’s data. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://equisresearch.medium.com/post-mortem-part-two-the-american-dream-voter-66dd6f673d1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The analysis</a> from the Latino-focused research outfit pointed to Latino approval of Trump’s economic policies <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/61b7e8e75c74f5558036268b/1639442667560/Post-Mortem+Part+Two+FINAL+Dec+13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a key factor</a> that helped Trump win over Latino voters worried about how COVID-19 would impact the economy. And because concerns about COVID-19 and the economy dominated the spotlight, immigration issues that might have kept some Latinos from backing Trump became less salient. That was important because Trump’s anti-immigration and anti-Latino rhetoric had kept some more conservative-leaning Latinos from voting for him in 2016, but with immigration pushed to the background in 2020, these voters now felt more comfortable casting a ballot for Trump. Additionally, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/latino-voters-moved-to-trump-because-of-covid-and-socialism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP attempts to label Democrats</a> as “socialists” likely contributed to these shifts as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, how Latinos voted in 2020 may also not square with Gallup’s party-affiliation data because Latinos are less likely to vote than other major racial and ethnic groups. In 2020, 54 percent of voting-eligible Latinos cast a ballot, <a href="https://clacls.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/7199/files/2021/05/Laird-W.-Bergad-and-Luis-A.-Miranda-Latino-Voter-Registration-and-Participation-Rates-in-the-2020-Election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to data</a> compiled by the Center for Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino Studies at City University of New York, and while this was the highest turnout mark for Latinos on record, it still lagged well behind Asian Americans (60 percent), Black Americans (63 percent) and white Americans (71 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, understanding which Latinos voted in 2020 is incredibly important. Equis found, for instance, that lower-propensity voters, many of whom were young, were less likely to have negative views of Trump than high-propensity voters, and that many ultimately backed Trump. For example, 17 percent of the Latino voters who backed Trump in Nevada in 2020 didn’t vote in 2016. Moreover, according to Equis, even though many younger Latino voters (those under the age of 50) had negative opinions of Trump, his standing among them improved by the fall of 2020. This means that as Latino voter turnout surged, especially among 18- to 44-year-olds (i.e., 60 percent of eligible Latino voters, per CUNY’s data), Trump stood to gain.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What does all this mean for Latinos’ party preferences looking ahead to the 2022 midterm elections? In short, despite the continued Democratic edge in party ID, there’s potential for the GOP to win over more persuadable Latino voters this November. Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has fallen especially hard</a> among Latinos, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-the-national-economy-assessments-of-prices-jobs-housing-and-the-stock-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like other</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/i8sxn720xf/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans</a>, Latinos <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-crime-latinos-c9b99c24-d495-48ae-9366-b39e619c99ef.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are particularly worried</a> about issues like the economy, COVID-19 and crime, which could benefit Republicans, especially if immigration, an issue that <a href="https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy01.its.virginia.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912919844327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has benefited Democrats</a> among Latinos, remains mostly sidelined. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With a Democrat in the White House, we’d also expect Republican-leaning Latinos <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be more likely to vote</a> in a midterm. Biden’s flagging numbers may also cost Democrats support from some Latinos in the middle, as well as depress turnout among Democratic-leaning Latinos. Recent generic-ballot polling, though, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/npwlx2cq4r/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally finds</a> <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/08222920/2202029_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats leading</a> among Latinos, although the <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017e-b883-d713-a1ff-fbabf09c0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">margins have varied</a> in ways <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/January-16-19-2022_Topline-Tables_January-23-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that could portend</a> a narrower gap between the parties. (In most cases, though, we’re relying on small samples of Latino voters within polls, so remember that means <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger margins of error</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, at this point it seems more likely than not that Latino voters will continue to prefer Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections. However, given the 2020 election results, the prominent issues that voters are worried about and Biden’s standing with the public, there’s plenty of reason to think that Republicans can further trim Democrats’ lead among Latino voters in 2022 — even if Democrats retain a sizable party-ID advantage among all Latinos.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Interested in who’s going to win the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Ohio in a few months? Well, we’ve got good news and bad news for you. The good news is that there are already 22 polls of the race! But the bad news is that 21 of them are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Internal polls are polls sponsored by either a candidate running in the race or an outside group that has endorsed one of the candidates. In other words, these are polls that have an agenda behind them — and that agenda is usually to make their preferred candidate look good. As a result, they are usually too good to be true for their sponsor. FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in 2017</a> that internal and partisan polls conducted during the last three weeks of U.S. House general elections overstated their party’s candidate by an average of 4 or 5 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This poses a serious problem for people (like us) just trying to get an honest read of a race — especially if internal polls are all (or most) of what we have to go off. And unfortunately, that’s not just the case in Ohio this year; it’s true in primaries nationwide. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We hunted down every poll we could find of 2022’s Senate, House and governor primaries (as of Feb. 10 at 3 p.m. Eastern), and a majority of them (at least 118 out of 229) are internal polls. And while we have polling data for a healthy 78 primaries so far (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i73-lpVV-Jo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s good</a>), that polling is 100 percent internal in 23 of those primaries (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i73-lpVV-Jo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s bad</a>).</p>

 <footer><p>*Alaska, California and Washington have all-party primaries where all candidates, regardless of party, run on the same ballot.</p>
 <p>Source: Polls</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">For an example of how internal polls can mislead, look no further than that Ohio Senate race. The Republican primary is a crowded affair with tons of undecided voters, creating an opportunity for several candidates to claim they’re doing well. For example, the campaign of former state Treasurer Josh Mandel recently released a <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshMandelOhio/status/1488960353115557892?s=20&amp;t=i5bdn_zQDgv1e-zqvGlFHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPA Intelligence poll</a> that gave himself 28 percent and businessman Mike Gibbons 17 percent. But a <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1488636017775104000?s=20&amp;t=gu_Uv7h-MDs-ZAobqvz5iA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cygnal poll</a> conducted for Gibbons around the same time put Gibbons at 16 percent and Mandel at only 13 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in early January, a <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneTimkenOH/status/1479426941971218433?s=20&amp;t=zGwbEHe1WPt8przQrAeHUw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Information Group survey</a> for former Ohio GOP Chair Jane Timken trumpeted that Timken was “statistically tied” with Mandel, 16 percent to 18 percent. And back in October, a <a href="https://twitter.com/politicoalex/status/1451212523873751042?s=20&amp;t=hXHa4vxgB-J7w3za5PRC6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio Lee poll</a> for a super PAC supporting author J.D. Vance similarly put Vance (16 percent) in a strong second place behind Mandel (19 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, these polls are all telling their own stories. But that doesn’t mean they’re totally useless. For instance, the fact that Mandel leads in even a couple of his opponents’ polls suggests that he is a front-runner. (The <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TRF-OH-22-GOP-Primary-1216-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only independent poll</a> of the race, conducted in December by the Trafalgar Group, concurs: It showed Mandel at 21 percent, Vance at 15 percent, Gibbons at 12 percent and Timken at 10 percent.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, internal polls’ trendlines can often be useful. For instance, in <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017e-d5b6-de19-a97e-f5b7f15e0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two Fabrizio Lee polls</a> since October, Vance has slumped to 10 percent and 9 percent, suggesting he is losing support over time. (In fact, it’s likely that these polls were released not to convince the public that Vance is doing well, but to convince <em>Vance</em> that his campaign needs to step it up.) Same with Mandel, whose own campaign’s polling staked him to an even bigger lead <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6096c989138a4a7ae28a2583/t/615130ca2389bb2832f7a74a/1632710859094/Ohio+Senate+Poll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in September</a> (37 percent to Vance’s 13 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Ohio, we don’t have a lot of independent polling to validate those internal polls. But when we do, it can be a useful reality check. Take this year’s Republican primary for Texas governor. According to a <a href="https://www.paradigm-llp.com/_files/ugd/2d9332_4cdc2c9131514e6588ee56d58fae71b5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> by Paradigm Partners on behalf of former Texas GOP Chair Allen West’s campaign, West leads incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott, 43 percent to 34 percent. But two independent polls taken around the same time (one from the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/555718826/The-Dallas-Morning-News-University-of-Texas-Tyler-Poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Tyler/Dallas Morning News</a> and one from <a href="https://uh.edu/hobby/election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/University of Houston</a>) put Abbott way ahead with 58-59 percent, while West is way back at 6-11 percent. That’s such a big disagreement that we reached out to Paradigm Partners to ask more about their methodology, and it turns out there’s a reason their poll is such a big outlier: While most polls are weighted to ensure they are demographically representative of the electorate, their survey was completely unweighted. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So you can see why it’s a problem that internal polls are such a large share of the primary polling data we have so far. And in fact, that problem may be understated. While we did our best to identify every internal poll so far this cycle, that “118” number is almost certainly an undercount. Just because we didn’t mark a poll as internal doesn’t mean it’s truly independent and unbiased. For instance, according to the New York Post, this <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/28/hochul-holds-solid-lead-over-james-in-ny-governor-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the Field Global poll</a> of the Democratic primary for governor of New York was paid for by an unknown “moderate political group” — hardly an uninterested actor in a race that looks like it will be another proxy war between Democrats’ moderate and progressive wings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the more unusual cases we identified is a quartet of <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21196588-ohio-poll-toplines-222?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Polling</a> surveys of <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/02/03/poll-trumps-endorsement-could-sway-gop-voters-toward-cox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican primaries</a> sponsored by the <em>Democratic</em> Governors Association. These aren’t internal polls because the DGA certainly isn’t endorsing GOP candidates — but they’re clearly not independent polls either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If anything, their purpose is probably to sow mischief in GOP primaries, with the hope that it will help Democrats in the general election. For instance, back in October, the DGA released a <a href="https://democraticgovernors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DGA-Polling-Memo-Status-of-the-MA-GOP-Primary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> of the Republican primary for governor of Massachusetts showing that conservative former state Rep. Geoff Diehl led moderate Gov. Charlie Baker, 50 percent to 29 percent. That poll may have contributed to doubt that Baker could win the primary, which in turn may have contributed to Baker’s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/01/metro/baker-telling-allies-he-isnt-running-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December decision to retire</a>. (Though to be clear, Baker almost certainly conducted his own polling and analysis to inform that decision.) Regardless, though, that decision rocketed Massachusetts to the top of the list of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/36-states-are-electing-governors-this-year-here-are-the-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governorships most likely to flip in 2022</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in November, the DGA also sponsored a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dvrzSIZ8TJrIoGanRopkOzBbjR-mFv4v/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> of the GOP gubernatorial primary in Pennsylvania — the results of which promoted a narrative that there is <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-republican-party-senate-governor-endorsement-20220205.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no clear front-runner</a> and that that could lead to the nomination of far-right state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who <a href="https://www.witf.org/2021/05/28/pa-sen-doug-mastriano-unlikely-to-face-consequences-over-newly-released-jan-6-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection</a> at the U.S. Capitol. Mastriano took 18 percent in the survey, more than any other candidate. And in the absence of more recent polling of the race, we have no independent confirmation of how close that result is to reality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, there are plenty of reasons to be wary of internal polls — and even some non-internal polls. But unfortunately, they’re most of the data that we currently have for 2022 primaries, so sometimes using them is unavoidable. That’s OK as long as you do so with your eyes open to the fact that they are trying to sell you an agenda. And once you factor in that agenda, sometimes internal polls can tell you something interesting after all — if not about the actual state of the race, then about what one of the actors in that race wants you to think.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A majority of Americans (62 percent) <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/welcoming-immigration-policies-remain-popular-but-immigration-is-not-a-critical-issue-for-most-americans/">backed a pathway to citizenship</a> for undocumented immigrants and believed more broadly that immigrants strengthen American society (56 percent), according to a recently published survey from the Public Religion Research Institute, conducted last September. But even though a majority of Americans from most religious backgrounds that PRRI surveyed supported creating a pathway to citizenship — with Black Protestants most in favor, at 75 percent — there was one notable exception: White evangelical Protestants were the least likely (47 percent) to support a pathway to citizenship. </li><li>The share of Americans extremely satisfied with their romantic relationship <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_020722/">dropped by 10 percentage points</a> since a year ago, according to a Jan. 20-24 poll from Monmouth University. But divorce lawyers shouldn’t get too excited: Majorities were still extremely satisfied with their relationship (60 percent) and felt that their partner is extremely important to their happiness (54 percent). In fact, the decline in relationship satisfaction puts the current number within the range of pre-pandemic figures, after an 11-point rise in Monmouth’s May 2020 survey.</li><li>On that romantic note, Americans aren’t enthused by Valentine’s Day. Fifty-eight percent of adults said that Valentine’s Day is not a “<a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2022/02/08/valentines-day-ranks-behind-major-holidays">real special occasion</a>,” according to a Jan. 27-31 poll from YouGov. Of the nine other holidays YouGov asked about, Americans preferred every one of them more than Valentine’s Day. Christmas was the most popular, leading Valentine’s Day by 69 points, and Americans even preferred the second-least-popular holiday, Labor Day, over Valentine’s Day by 8 points.</li><li>Twelve percent of registered voters ranked “division in the country” as <a href="https://politics.georgetown.edu/2022/02/03/battleground-civility-poll-voters-agree-politics-has-grown-less-civil-since-covid-19-and-beginning-of-biden-presidency/">the most important issue facing America</a>, just narrowly behind the rising cost of living (13 percent), according to a Jan. 22-27 poll conducted by Lake Research Partners and The Tarrance Group for Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service. Two-thirds of voters said that the pandemic had led to politics getting worse, while 58 percent felt that the Jan. 6 Capitol attack had made violent political protests more likely to happen in the future. In total, 43 percent said that politics had become less civil during Biden’s presidency.</li><li>Fewer Americans believe that Trump <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/08/fewer-americans-now-say-trump-bears-a-lot-of-responsibility-for-the-jan-6-riot/">bears “some” or “a lot” of responsibility</a> for the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, according to a Jan. 10-17 poll from the Pew Research Center. The share of Americans assigning blame to Trump declined from 75 percent in January 2021 to 67 percent in January 2022. This change resulted from a smaller share of Americans (43 percent this January, compared with 52 percent last January) saying Trump bore “a lot” of responsibility, while the share assigning him “some” responsibility was nearly identical.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans and Democrats disagree on all manner of things. Surveys suggest they <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2020/october/republicans-and-democrats-hate-the-other-side-more-than-they-lov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often don’t even like each other</a>, and voting data shows they each commonly live among like-minded Americans. But in this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, political scientists Yanna Krupnikov and John Barry Ryan suggest that focusing on the left/right divide in American politics is reductive. By doing so, we are missing another important divide, one that may actually run counter to the idea that America is hopelessly conflicted between red and blue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In their new book “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/other-divide/BAEDF5146C86E57F26696EF7AAB800FE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Other Divide</a>,” they argue that the gulf between Americans who are deeply involved in politics and those who are not deserves more of our attention. In fact, they say, the kinds of partisans who are engaged enough to actually despise the other side only make up 15-20 percent of the country. The other 80 percent or so are focused on their daily lives and, in large part, don’t like politics or want to talk about them. Krupnikov and Barry Ryan argue it’s a problem that the 15-20 percent minority drive our understanding of the two parties and politics.</p>

			<title>What Democrats And Republicans Get Wrong About Inflation</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Americans <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are pessimistic</a> about one of the weirdest economies in recent memory, and their negativity is largely due to inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced today that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prices increased 7.5 percent year-over-year in January 2022</a>, the highest figure since 1982, and as such, more expensive milk, furniture and cars — and the fear that their prices <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will continue to skyrocket</a> — are likely to remain top of mind for Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This, of course, has led to a lot of finger-pointing as to who — or what — is to blame for the price increases we’re seeing. Democrats have <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-democrats-supply-chain-prices-midterms-f6de1ceb-21a1-469c-a83f-88f48fc07a4b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed supply chain deficiencies</a> due to COVID-19, as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/01/10/white-house-inflation-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large corporations</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/25/business/biden-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monopolies</a>. Republicans, meanwhile, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/10/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-whats-their-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked</a> President Biden’s legislative agenda, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-are-they-right-2021-11-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming that his signature pieces of legislation</a> — most notably the American Rescue Plan featuring $1,400 stimulus checks paid directly to many Americans — are to blame. And to be sure, whether fair or not, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-are-afraid-of-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Americans</a> do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/business/economy/biden-economy-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blame Biden</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what <em>is </em>responsible for inflation in the U.S.? Is it all about the pandemic supply chain, as many Democrats claim, or corporate greed? Or does it have more to do with Biden’s policies, as Republicans have posited? </p>



<h2><strong>Inflation isn’t just a supply-chain issue, and the stimulus likely made it worse</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the Democrats’ most consistent talking points has been that the COVID-19-afflicted supply chain is to blame for our current levels of inflation. Biden has even gone as far as to say that supply chain issues have “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAqwiD_CH-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything to do</a>” with it, while House Democrats work to craft legislation <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/31/house-democrats-pivot-economy-legislative-win-00003385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted at ameliorating supply chain issues</a>. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/opinion/inflation-economy-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many economists</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/11/22829221/inflation-rate-cpi-supply-chain-biden-transitory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> say that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/15/omicron-supply-chain-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the foundering supply chain</a> has played a heavy hand in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/10/24/22743104/supply-chain-inflation-shortages-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving up prices</a>, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The thinking goes as follows: Americans stopped using their gym, nail salons and other services as their spending patterns rapidly changed in 2020, and the global supply chain — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/business/shortages-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already had issues</a> —  was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/business/inflation-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not equipped to deal with the surge</a> in demand for consumer durables (e.g., home workout equipment, office furniture) after the initial global economic shutdown. Combine that rapid demand increase with a shortage in supply, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/inflation-definition.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-supply-chain&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_top_links_recirc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you get higher prices</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the same time, this Democratic talking point has its limits, as it’s become clear to many economists that American inflation isn’t <em>just</em> a supply chain issue: Our economic response — namely, the trillions of dollars of COVID-19 stimulus paid out over the last 24 months — appears to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-13/u-s-inflation-is-starting-to-look-like-a-stimulus-led-outlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a meaningful differentiator</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A good way to tease this out is to look at Europe, which has faced similar supply chain issues and an even worse oil shock, as it is more dependent on foreign oil <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=32&amp;t=6#:~:text=How%20much%20oil%20consumed%20by,day%20(b%2Fd)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the U.S.</a> And yet, European countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/business/ecb-europe-interest-rates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have experienced lower inflation</a>, perhaps due in part to <a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2021/number/4/article/fiscal-stimulus-lessons-from-the-us-to-the-eu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their smaller government response</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Global supply chain problems affect every country in the world, but the United States has had more inflation than other countries,” said <a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/people/jason-furman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Furman</a>, a professor of economics at Harvard University and chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama. “If you look compared to Europe, in the United States goods consumption is higher, and services consumption is higher than what it is [in Europe].”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason for that higher consumption is government spending. In 2020, a divided Congress under former President Donald Trump passed two separate pieces of legislation — first the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 trillion CARES Act</a> in March, which <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/28/how-many-people-will-get-1200-in-every-state/111604090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doled out</a> $1,200 checks to most single adults and even more to families, then a $900 billion package <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/21/948862052/house-passes-900-billion-coronavirus-relief-bill-ending-months-long-stalemate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in December</a> that, among other aid, issued $600 targeted checks. But then in March 2021, Democrats passed another round of government stimulus in a $1.9 trillion relief package — including $1,400 direct payments to individual Americans — which some experts warned at the time <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/summers-warns-u-s-risks-rising-inflation-amid-massive-stimulus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might cause inflation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it does appear that this most recent round of government spending is at least partially responsible for our current levels of inflation. An October 2021 paper found, for example, that the American Rescue Plan <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2021/october/is-american-rescue-plan-taking-us-back-to-1960s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely made inflation slightly worse</a>, causing significant (but small and fleeting) upward pressure on prices, and many experts have stood by their 2021 assertions that the extra stimulus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/business/economy/inflation-biden-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would lead to inflation</a>. Of course, Biden’s additional stimulus was arguably <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/2021-was-a-year-of-bold-economic-policy-that-must-be-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary for Americans to participate in the economy</a> at the time, and polling <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/19/most-americans-say-another-round-of-covid-19-economic-relief-will-be-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found widespread support</a> among Americans for more relief. But it has also led <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-target-biden-democrats-over-inflation-what-would-they-do-n1284839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republicans to claim</a> that Biden’s policies are responsible for the historic price increases we’re seeing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Furman stressed to me that inflation likely would have been high even without a COVID-19 relief bill, however, because of a reopening economy and <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/what-are-base-effects-and-how-do-they-distort-inflation-yahoo-u-113754047.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base effect distortions</a>. Moreover, rising gas prices — one of the most tangible ways in which Americans process inflation — likely have nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan and much more to do with the dynamics of global oil. There is at least some evidence, though, that government spending has caused inflation, beyond the explanation that it’s merely been a supply chain issue.</p>



<h2><strong>But not all government spending leads to inflation</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Critically, however, despite what many Republicans claim, not all government spending has the same effect on inflation. In fact, historically government spending hasn’t usually led to inflation. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014292114001494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 paper</a> in the European Economic Review found, for example, that the effect of government spending on inflation post-World War II was “<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/may/how-does-government-spending-affect-inflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not statistically different from zero</a>.” But <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/dupor/sel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Dupor</a>, a co-author of that study and vice president of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told me that the size of the intervention matters — and that could help explain why government spending today has spurred inflation but hadn’t in recent memory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The big difference, I think, from now relative to that is just the enormity of the government spending,” Dupor said. “That could explain why it wasn’t finding big effects, while there could be big effects now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even still, not all government spending the Biden administration has greenlit has likely contributed to inflation. For example, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Biden signed into law in November is unlikely to have contributed to inflation for a number of reasons. First of all, very <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/politics/biden-infrastructure-bill-spending-economy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little of it has been paid for</a> at this point. Second, it’s targeted at ramping up the productive capacity of the economy — i.e., investing in new technologies and creating jobs — which means it might <a href="https://www.epi.org/open-letter-from-nobel-laureates-in-support-of-economic-recovery-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even tamp down inflation</a>. That’s different from the American Rescue Plan, whose $1,400 stimulus checks don’t build up the economy in the same way, according to the economists I spoke with. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans, however, aren’t necessarily making this kind of distinction when it comes to government spending. According to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/26/biden-poll-social-spending-inflation-00001785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January Politico-Harvard survey</a>, 43 percent of Americans think that the bipartisan infrastructure bill will increase inflation, while just 10 percent think it will decrease inflation (although 35 percent did say they think inflation will remain unchanged). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/thomas-philippon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Philippon</a>, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said that his biggest concern with the recent inflation brought about by the stimulus is that it muddies the waters of government spending in the eyes of voters. That, in turn, Philippon said, expends political capital that can’t be used to tackle other key issues, like infrastructure spending or child poverty.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“People then lump together all kinds of government spending, the good and the bad,” Philippon said.</p>



<h2>Big corporations aren’t the biggest cause, but …</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, some Democrats have singled out big companies and monopolies for their perceived role in driving up prices. Figures across the party’s ideological gamut -— from Sens. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/25/inflation-cause-democrats-amplify-nonsense-corporate-greed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/12/1072295047/inflation-is-still-surging-and-some-democrats-see-one-culprit-greedy-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a> to Biden — have posited that big businesses, by jacking up their prices in the middle of a pandemic, are to blame for inflation, and that a lack of competition has allowed corporate behemoths to raise their prices unabated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first glance, this explanation appears less plausible than other messaging on inflation. Profit-seeking companies didn’t suddenly become more profit-seeking during the pandemic, nor were they more generous before it. Additionally, corporate concentration has <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164974/corporate-concentration-inflation-price-gouging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown steadily since the 1990s</a> — an era of historically low inflation. <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/inflation-market-power-and-price-controls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A January survey of economists</a> at the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found most experts in agreement on both questions: Inflation wasn’t explained by big firms deciding to get richer, and antitrust interventions — such as those tossed about by the Biden administration — weren’t likely to curb inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is an element of the prices we’re seeing today — and how Americans are responding to them — that could be explained by big business run amok. Philippon, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whose book</a> “The Great Reversal” focuses on how a lack of competition and corporate concentration have defined the modern American economy, told me that one reason why inflation is such a big deal in the U.S. is that prices were already so high to begin with.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“That’s not a statement about rapid inflation, it’s a statement about slowly rising profit margins that slowly choke off the middle class,” Philippon said. “One reason it’s particularly painful in the U.S. is that prices were already high, people’s purchasing power, the real value of their wages was already being eroded by market power before. Then when you add to that a burst of inflation, it’s even more painful.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That may explain why recent polling has found that Americans <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-find-link-between-inflation-and-corporate-greed-convincing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are sympathetic</a> to arguments that attribute inflation to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/19/inflation-companies-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate greed</a>, and why Biden is singing a fairly populist tune on inflation. But as with all aspects of messaging on the issue, whether Democrats or Republicans are more right on the facts of inflation has very little to do with its potential electoral impact. Prices have to stabilize for Americans to feel good about the economy — and for Democrats to feel good about their chances in 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don’t think there’s any message that would make people feel good about 7 percent inflation,” Furman said.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Dinesh D’Souza can always be counted on to have a bespoke conspiracy theory. In the trailer for his “2,000 Mules” “documentary,” faux static flickers across the screen over footage of what appears to be people voting at ballot drop boxes. A slow, mournful rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” plays in the background. And that’s when D’Souza, a pro-Trump conservative personality who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/us/politics/dinesh-dsouza-facts-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pardoned by the former president</a> after being convicted of making illegal campaign contributions, drops the (totally unproven and false) bombshell: Thousands of “mules” stuffed ballot boxes to steal the election for President Biden. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is D’Souza’s version of the Big Lie, the unfounded claim that widespread voter fraud plagued the 2020 presidential election and that President Joe Biden’s win was illegitimate. But it is not the only version — the Big Lie means different things to different people. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A third of Americans — and a majority of Republicans — <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_012722/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe the Big Lie</a>, but the disparate theories include the <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/oct/15/steve-scalises-flawed-argument-states-didnt-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flawed-but-plausible</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/28/donald-trump-georgia-2020-election-dead-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely</a> and the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-how-hugo-chavez-dead-since-2013-became-responsible-for-trumps-election-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illogical</a>. While no two Big Lie theories are identical in composition, they do share commonality in function. In-depth polling and academic research reveal belief in the Big Lie is incredibly resilient and incredibly influential, swaying <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-big-lie-voting-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the creation of new voting laws</a> and shaping <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/02/07/more-than-80-pro-deniers-are-running-for-key-state-offices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election campaigns</a> for 2022 and beyond. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a mountain of baseless overlapping claims piled up inside the stultifying biodome of the Big Lie: voters casting multiple ballots, dead people voting, ballot-counting machines flipping votes, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-fact-check-debunking-italy-gate/fact-check-evidence-disproves-claims-of-italian-conspiracy-to-meddle-in-u-s-election-idUSKBN29K2N8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign</a> <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dominion-servers-germany-seized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nations</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9900544617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacking</a> systems to swap totals. The Big Lie is an à la carte conspiracy theory — a bit like QAnon in that respect — where adherents pick and choose what sounds right to them and disregard what doesn’t. Each individual who believes the Big Lie has their own suspicions about what took place, a personal recipe of different conspiracies to nourish their belief that the election was illegitimate. In right-wing chat groups on the messaging app Telegram, these theories are traded as casually as chats about the weather. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“What’s going to be any different this time?!” a user in a QAnon Telegram chat wrote about the midterm elections this past Tuesday evening. “Wait till 3am on election night and lots of mail in ballots and dead people voting.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brian Cates, a writer for the far-right publication The Epoch Times, was less morbid and more focused on the levers of power when he posted to his nearly 80,000 followers on Telegram earlier this week. “[W]hat happened on election night? Trump was surging to victory. They had to shut everything down and then spent THREE DAYS furiously ginning up enough fake votes to hand Biden the ‘win’ on Friday night.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Every iteration of the Big Lie, though, is wrong. The ones in the darkest corner of the Internet? Wrong. The ones brought forward in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/elections/2021/01/06/trumps-failed-efforts-overturn-election-numbers/4130307001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits by the Trump campaign</a>? Wrong. The ones already debunked by news sources? Still wrong. There is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voter-fraud-election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-7fcb6f134e528fee8237c7601db3328f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence of widespread fraud</a> in the 2020 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, polling gives us a glimpse of the most popular theories on the Big Lie menu. Last summer, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-belief-voter-fraud-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a YouGov/CBS News poll</a> asked voters who thought there had been widespread voter fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exactly what they thought had happened. They were asked about various sources of voting and how much of the voter fraud came from those sources, either “a lot of it,” “some of it” or “hardly any or none.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Seventy-seven percent said “a lot” of voter fraud and irregularities had come from ballots cast by mail, and 70 percent said a lot of it had come from voting machines or equipment that were manipulated, but just 22 percent said a lot of the fraud had come from ballots cast in person. Racism also appeared to inform a lot of thinking around the Big Lie: 72 percent said a lot of the fraud had come from ballots cast in major cities and urban areas, compared with 22 percent and 14 percent who said a lot of it had come from suburbs and rural areas, respectively. And 39 percent of those who believed voter fraud was widespread said “a lot” of fraud had come from ballots cast in Black communities, while 25 percent said so for white communities and 27 percent said so for voters in Hispanic communities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The University of Massachusetts Amherst and YouGov <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/toplines-and-crosstabs-december-2021-national-poll-presidential-election-jan-6th-insurrection-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fielded a similar poll</a> in December, asking those who said Biden’s victory was probably or definitely illegitimate to choose from a list of options all the reasons they believed that to be true. In that group, 83 percent said they believed fraudulent ballots had been counted, 81 percent said they believed absentee ballots had been cast using dead people’s identities and 76 percent endorsed the theory that ineligible voters had cast ballots. Just 39 percent said they believed voting machines had been reprogrammed by foreign governments to change ballots from Trump to Biden. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s important to note that people are not just picking everything,” said Alexander Theodoridis, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who fielded the survey. “Pure expressive responding would be like, ‘Yeah, everything was wrong with this election. It’s all this stuff.’ Whereas the way they did it suggests they do have at least some critical view of some of these [theories].” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea of expressive responding — the tendency for people to give answers to pollsters that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-meteor/trump-clinton-many-young-americans-prefer-giant-meteor-poll-finds-idUSKCN12I20S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflect their feelings</a> or values, but not necessarily their true beliefs — has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/27/no-america-is-not-on-the-cusp-of-a-civil-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been cited</a> as a possible explanation for the high percentage of Republicans in polls who say they believe the election was stolen. Some Republicans, in other words, might <em>say</em> they think the election was stolen when what they really mean is they think the results of the election stink.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Theodoridis has used some polling tools to test how genuine belief in the Big Lie is. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/07/republicans-big-lie-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He and his colleague Lane Cuthbert</a> used <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a research technique</a> meant to reduce expressive responding that went something like this: Survey respondents were divided into two groups, given a list of statements and asked <em>how many</em> of the statements they agreed with, but not which ones. The list of statements were identical, except one group was given an extra statement that the researchers wanted to test on: “Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election was legitimate.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Basically, if the average person in the control group chooses two out of four items and the average person in the treatment group chooses three out of the five items, you know that the only difference between those averages is the additional fifth item,” Theodoridis said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using this method, Theodoridis and Cuthbert found that only 28 percent of Republicans thought that Biden was legitimately elected. In their survey, <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Jan6thAnniversaryCrosstabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 percent of Republicans</a> said Biden’s victory was legitimate, and 8 percent said they weren’t sure. Theodoridis said this suggests that the Republicans in the survey were expressing a genuine belief. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if some or all of the Americans who say they believe the Big Lie don’t really mean it, the consequences of that expressed belief are very real. A forthcoming study based on a series of daily tracking surveys shows that even when those who believe in the Big Lie are confronted with evidence that counters it, their beliefs don’t waver. Kevin Arceneaux, a political science professor at Sciences Po, and Rory Truex, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, teamed up to run tracking surveys of U.S. registered voters from October 2020 through January 2021. As part of the surveys, the pair asked respondents who had identified Trump as the winner of the 2020 election about whether certain scenarios (such as Trump conceding, the Electoral College awarding more votes to Biden or Biden being sworn in) would change their minds. Of those registered voters, 45 percent said they would change their mind if Trump conceded, 31 percent said they would if Biden won the Electoral College, and 38 percent said they would accept the results if Biden was sworn in. But as those events occurred and Arceneaux and Truex continued their survey, belief in the Big Lie remained relatively unchanged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not totally surprising — if you ask a hypothetical question, you get a hypothetical answer,” Arceneaux said. “I was surprised how much the aggregate results did not really move in response to actual events that happened.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Arceneaux and Truex’s work revealed that not only is belief in the Big Lie tenacious, it also impacts voters’ views of politicians. When they asked Americans to compare hypothetical political candidates, Republican voters favored candidates who embraced the Big Lie by an average of 5.7 percentage points to candidates who accurately said Trump lost the election. This suggests that the Big Lie is not going anywhere soon and that it will have a meaningful sway on elections. Already we’ve witnessed the Big Lie being <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-jan-6-election-lie/2022/01/05/82f4cad4-6cb6-11ec-974b-d1c6de8b26b0_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wielded as a campaign tool</a> by Republican candidates across the country, demonstrating the power of this belief among the party’s voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as polls continue to capture the millions of Americans who endorse the Big Lie, precisely what they believe matters less than how that belief influences their actions. </p>]]></description>

<p>In 1939, officials working with the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) went to Cleveland, Ohio, as part of the agency’s national effort to grade neighborhoods based on their perceived mortgage-lending risk.</p>
<p>One of the neighborhoods that officials visited — now known mostly as Fairfax — was 55 percent Black, and as such, they gave this area a “D” grade, meaning they thought Fairfax was “hazardous,” or at high risk for defaulting on mortgage loans. <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=12/41.498/-81.769&amp;maps=0&amp;city=cleveland-oh&amp;area=D21">In their report</a>, HOLC officials concluded that property prices were trending down due to a “strong colored infiltration” and that there was a “detrimental change of ownership occupancy from white to colored.” Fairfax, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/realestate/what-is-redlining.html">most metropolitan neighborhoods</a> where Black people lived in the early 1900s, was then marked with red ink in the HOLC’s maps — a practice referred to as redlining.</p>
<p>It’s been over 80 years since the lines were drawn in Fairfax and over 50 years since <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-11/50-years-after-the-fair-housing-act-redlining-persists">the use of redlining was legally banned</a>, but the impact of redlining is still felt in cities like Cleveland, where redlined neighborhoods are some of the most starkly segregated in the country.</p>

<p>WHITEBLACKLATINOASIANOTHER“BEST”“DESIRABLE”“DECLINING”“HAZARDOUS”</p>
<p>But it’s not just Cleveland. In its 20 years of existence, the now-defunct HOLC drew hundreds of these maps across the country. In total, we analyzed the demographics of 138 metropolitan areas where HOLC drew maps, using data provided by the University of Richmond’s <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/">Mapping Inequality</a> project and by the 2020 census. And we found that nearly all formerly redlined zones in the country are still disproportionately Black, Latino or Asian compared with their surrounding metropolitan area, while two-thirds of greenlined zones — neighborhoods that HOLC deemed “best” for mortgage lending — are still overwhelmingly white.</p>
<p>“The redlining maps are like the Rosetta stone of American cities,” said LaDale Winling, a professor of history at Virginia Tech and one of the researchers behind the Mapping Inequality project. Winling told us that these maps were used to codify and institutionalize practices that had already been ongoing at a more scattershot level within the real estate industry.</p>
<p>You can see the effects of that institutionalized segregation clearly in this national map of formerly greenlined and redlined zones:</p>
<p>Most formerly redlined zones are people of color; most greenlined zones are white</p>

<p>Includes only micro- and metropolitan areas with both A- (“best”) and D-rated (“hazardous”) zones in their redlining map — 138 of a total 143 metropolitan areas in the University of Richmond’s Mapping Inequality project. Circle sizes are based on total population in the surrounding area of that metro’s redlining map and positions are approximate, meaning they do not represent exact locations.</p>
<p>But despite formerly redlined zones sharing a purpose — to disproportionately deny loans to low-income Americans and, in particular, Black and minority Americans — the legacy of redlining differs from city to city and region to region.</p>
<p>Formerly redlined zones in the Northeast and Midwest are among the most segregated areas in the country. In those regions, a higher proportion of Black Americans live in redlined zones compared with those zones’ surrounding areas — and a higher proportion than can be found in other regions of the country. Meanwhile, in the South, formerly redlined zones aren’t as segregated. But less residential segregation doesn’t mean that the South is a more equitable region for Black and minority Americans, especially given its history of slavery and the Jim Crow era. Additionally, even though redlining was a housing policy that heavily targeted Black Americans, redlining has also affected immigrants and other minorities, in particular Latino Americans — something visible today in places like California. But at the same time, huge demographic shifts, suburbanization, urban renewal and gentrification have also changed the landscape of many of these cities. In some cities, formerly redlined zones are now whiter and more developed than they were in the 1940s. In other cities, there are more Black people than white people living in formerly greenlined areas, or areas that government officials once rated as “best.”</p>
<p>There is no one legacy when it comes to redlining. And its legacy is particularly devastating because, as we were told by Stephen Menendian, assistant director of the Othering &amp; Belonging Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, “Housing really is at the core of every expression of racial inequality in America.”</p>
<p><a href="https://s.538.io/redlining/#explore-top">Jump to explore your city</a>The myth of the northern “Promised Land”</p>
<p>The legacy of redlining is particularly pronounced in the Northeast and Midwest,1 where cities like Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Chicago are home to some of the most segregated formerly redlined zones in the country. This segregation is especially entrenched in redlined cities with large Black populations. Of the 19 such cities in these regions, 16 were still segregated, with over two-thirds as many Black people living in formerly redlined areas as in the surrounding area. White people, meanwhile, made up less than a third of the population of formerly redlined areas and were vastly overrepresented in formerly greenlined areas.2</p>
<p>One reason northern cities remain so segregated is because of what historians call the Great Migration and Second Great Migration. From the 1910s through the 1970s, millions of Black Americans fled the oppressive Jim Crow South in <a href="https://rosaparksbiography.org/bio/the-northern-promised-land-that-wasnt/">search of jobs in industrialized cities and a better life in the Northeast and Midwest</a>. But Black Americans didn’t find <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297198/">refuge from systemic racism</a> in these regions, especially when it came to housing policy.</p>
<p>In fact, scholars have found that the increase in Black Americans in these regions led to growing efforts like redlining in northern metro areas to keep Black Americans and other immigrants in specific areas and prevent them from moving into predominantly white neighborhoods. Consequently, Black families had little opportunity to build generational wealth.</p>
<p>Take Pittsburgh. It saw a massive uptick in its population in the early 1900s, but Black Americans moving in were limited to <a href="https://aaregistry.org/story/the-hill-district-pittsburgh/">pre-war segregated areas</a> like the Hill District, which in 1937 was officially <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=12/40.442/-80.087&amp;maps=0&amp;city=pittsburgh-pa&amp;area=D10&amp;adimage=4/49.668/-138.955">redlined</a> by HOLC officials because of what they described as an “infiltration” and “concentration of negro and undesirables.”</p>
<p>Today, the Hill District, like all neighborhoods encompassing formerly redlined zones in the Steel City, is still overwhelmingly segregated. Pittsburgh’s formerly redlined zones have, on average, close to three times as many Black people living in them as compared to their surrounding areas — making Pittsburgh the second most segregated redlined city in the country,3 just behind Cleveland.</p>

<p>PITTSBURGH’S SURROUNDING AREA:</p>
<p>WHITE74.9%BLACK12.9%</p>
<p>One reason why an area like the Hill District is still so segregated is that redlining created a lack of investment in parts of Pittsburgh that persists today. Last year, a team of researchers <a href="https://newpittsburghcourier.com/2021/09/11/report-most-banks-give-citys-black-neighborhoods-few-loans/">released a report</a> that looked at bank lending data and public investment documents in Pittsburgh from 2007 to 2019, finding that just 7 percent of home mortgage loans went to predominantly minority neighborhoods in that time period, despite the residents of these neighborhoods comprising <a href="https://www.pghlending.com/_files/ugd/dcc000_182adaaa28e94fc9ac70a51578b56c70.pdf#page=23">almost 21 percent</a> of the city’s population. And out of $11.8 billion in loans to borrowers, less than 4 percent went to Black people.</p>
<p>“[Redlining] biased where investment was made,” Bruce Mitchell, a senior analyst at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition told us, with “hazardous” areas like Hill District suffering from years of neglect. Mitchell said it’s this lack of investment in formerly redlined areas that is one of redlining’s most devastating consequences.</p>
<p>Like Pittsburgh, Chicago saw a huge surge in its Black population as part of the Great Migration. Many Black people moved to Chicago’s South Side, north of Washington Park — the area where many of Chicago’s redlines were ultimately drawn.</p>
<p>At the time government appraisers drew those lines, housing near parks, lakes and swimming pools was typically inhabited by white people, but in one zone surrounding Washington Park appraisers noted that it had been “almost completely monopolized by the colored race.” <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/41.839/-87.885&amp;maps=0&amp;city=chicago-il&amp;area=D74&amp;adview=full&amp;adimage=3/41.574/-141.328">Appraisers concluded</a> that Black Americans couldn’t be “closed in” and Washington Park was already “doomed,” so they drew a redline around the area in their map.</p>
<p>Today, there are over 90 percent more Black Chicagoans in redlined zones than in the surrounding area.</p>

<p>In the South, most formerly redlined areas are also still starkly segregated — 28 of the 31 cities we analyzed.4 And while they aren’t as segregated as formerly redlined zones in the North, the formerly <i>greenlined</i> zones in the South are more segregated than in the North. On average, the South has almost twice as many white people living in greenlined zones compared with those zones’ surrounding areas — a much higher share than is seen in the North.</p>
<p>That’s important for understanding the legacy of redlining in the South because slavery and Jim Crow laws have played a much bigger role in the South’s unique form of segregation. Winling, who was one of the researchers behind the Mapping Inequality project, told us that Black Americans in the North began to move into greenlined areas after white populations started to flee because city neighborhoods were rapidly diversifying. But in some southern cities, he said, this didn’t happen to the same extent.</p>
<p>Take a city like Atlanta. Its neighborhood of Buckhead held <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-22/buckhead-fights-atlanta-s-multifamily-housing-push">the headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan</a> from the early 1920s to the mid-1930s. Currently, Buckhead is the city’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2021/11/05/buckhead-atlanta-secession-buckxit-impact">whitest and wealthiest</a> neighborhood, and it’s also where most of the “best” areas were drawn during in the late 1930s. And as can be seen on the map below, those “best” areas are 80 percent white.</p>

<p>Buckhead also remains very segregated from the rest of Atlanta. In fact, neighborhood residents are now <a href="https://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2021/09/01/buckhead-inches-closer-to-seceding-from-the-city-of-atlanta/">backing an effort</a> in the city’s legislature to create their own city and secede from Atlanta, a <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/atlantacitygeorgia">majority Black city</a>. If this were to happen, it would be financially devastating for Atlanta since the city would lose <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-01/buckhead-cityhood-vote-district-wants-to-secede-from-atlanta">an estimated 38 percent of its tax revenue</a>.</p>
<p>According to Andre Perry, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro and author of “Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America’s Black Cities,” it is these white enclaves in the South “where power is often exercised the most.”</p>
<p>Part of the way these areas amassed power was through the South’s long history of violent racism toward Black Americans, especially those moving to predominantly white neighborhoods. Consider Birmingham, Alabama, a city where <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40193532?read-now=1&amp;refreqid=excelsior%3A7db422490180d69e9d7d29353ee7c36c&amp;seq=14#page_scan_tab_contents">bombings against Black residents were so rampant</a> in the mid-1900s — there were more than 50 house bombings and burnings from the late 1940s until the mid-1960s — that Birmingham became known as “Bombingham.”</p>
<p>This ongoing violence, in addition to redlining, meant that much of Birmingham’s white population was confined to its greenlined zones. This pattern is still visible today, with the share of white people living in the city’s formerly greenlined zones being over twice as high as the share living in the surrounding area. In fact, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/half-century-federal-oversight-segregated-neighborhoods-pervasive-abc/story?id=82678035">per an ABC News analysis of mortgage-lending data</a>, people of color are still less likely to have their loans approved in majority-white neighborhoods.</p>

<p>But parts of the South’s racial makeup are changing, albeit slowly. Since the 1990s, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/14/black-migration-south/">more and more Black Americans have moved to the South</a> — a movement demographers are terming “The New Great Migration.” This has changed cities like Atlanta and Birmingham, which have also seen an influx of Asian Americans and other minorities, but according to Taylor, the Princeton professor, the South’s fixation on white exclusivity in places like Buckhead is still a big problem.</p>
<p>“People are returning to places that are just as segregated, just as excluded,” Taylor said.</p>
<p>“Anti-Black racism hurt everyone”</p>
<p>The harm redlining has caused Black Americans is extensive, but redlining has also affected other minorities in the U.S. — particularly the country’s growing Latino population. In some cities, government officials directly targeted Latinos with their redlining maps while in others, the continued lack of investment in formerly redlined areas has caused disproportionate harm to Latino communities.</p>
<p>Of 50 cities across the country with large Latino populations,5 we found that 72 percent have segregated Latino communities living in formerly redlined areas.</p>
<p>“That’s why I always say, anti-Black racism hurt everyone,” Perry said. “There’s lots of places where … anti-Black racism and hate against brown people and other groups really limited the amount of housing options for people of color, and the only places that they can generally go are formerly redlined or Black neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>Take San Diego. Its formerly redlined zones are the most segregated in the West, with 76 percent more Latinos living in these neighborhoods compared to the surrounding areas. Latinos were targeted <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=15/32.719/-117.131&amp;maps=0&amp;city=san-diego-ca&amp;area=D5">by HOLC appraisers</a>, too, as they wrote in their 1935 report that the area southeast of Fairmont Park had “many Mexicans with a definite trend of infiltration.”</p>

<p>In other parts of California, appraisers used even harsher, more racist language. In 1939, San Gabriel, a city in Los Angeles County, was <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=13/34.101/-118.173&amp;maps=0&amp;city=los-angeles-ca&amp;area=D13">90 percent Mexican American</a>, and appraisers described them as “peon Mexicans” and as a “distinctly subversive racial influence.”</p>
<p>Up until 1930, the U.S. census <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/">classified</a> Mexicans as white, but in the 1930 census, the government classified them as their own race. According to Jerry González, a historian at the University of Texas at San Antonio, this allowed the U.S. government to more easily target Mexican Americans as a racial threat.</p>
<p>This targeting was especially clear in redlining practices of the time. González told us that officials would specifically identify Mexicans living in places like Los Angeles, and then include language in their reports like, “do not sell this home to persons not fully of the Caucasian race.” González said that language gave housing officials the flexibility to more easily discriminate.</p>

<p>It’s not just Latinos that HOLC officials targeted either. Appraisers described other areas derisively as a “melting pot … long been thoroughly blighted,” also classifying Asian Americans as “subversive racial elements” in California. Today, San Gabriel’s Asian and Latino communities are still segregated from the city’s white population.</p>
<p>Beyond the red lines</p>
<p>Of course, segregation in many cities doesn’t fit neatly inside formerly redlined zones. This doesn’t mean, however, that these cities avoided or overcame a racist housing system. On the contrary, housing segregation manifests in ways that go far beyond HOLC’s color lines on these maps.</p>
<p>“The refusal of federal agencies to issue mortgages to those neighborhoods in the 1930s and 40s — that’s one of many policies that were followed,” Richard Rothstein, author of “The Color of Law,” said. “But it doesn’t entirely determine today’s landscape, and there are many, many other policies that get ignored that are equally important.”</p>
<p>For instance, even though it is <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/city-snapshot-detroit">one of the most segregated cities</a> in the country, Detroit’s segregation doesn’t match up with its formerly redlined zones. This is in large part because as Black southerners moved into Detroit during the Great Migration, white Detroiters responded by <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22077/w22077.pdf">leaving the city in droves</a>, mostly moving out to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america">federally subsidized and racially homogenous suburbs</a> — a migration that historians call “white flight.” White Detroiters went through great lengths to keep their wealthy suburbs exclusively white, too, with measures as extreme as building <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/detroit-segregation-wall/">a half-mile-long concrete wall</a> to physically separate themselves from Black families.</p>

<p>According to Joe Darden, a professor of geography, environment and spatial sciences at Michigan State University, the Detroit metro area continues to experience white flight, too. As Black Detroiters move into predominantly white suburbs, many white Detroiters move away — further perpetuating residential segregation.</p>
<p>“The future of Black suburbanization is going to be looking at those places that used to be predominantly white, and turning them more and more to be predominantly Black,” Darden said. “As Blacks move in, whites, even to this day, still have a tendency to move further and further out.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Philadelphia is seeing the opposite happen: More white people are moving into its formerly redlined zones. And as this occurs, property values increase and lower-income people, many of whom are Black, can no longer afford to stay.</p>
<p>This gentrification has fundamentally shifted where Philadelphia’s varying demographics reside so that its present-day segregation doesn’t really match up against its formerly redlined zones. In 2019, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/gentrification-philadelphia-african-american-latino-investment-neighborhood-20190320.html">a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition</a> found that seven cities account for almost half of all the gentrification in the U.S., and by their metrics, Philadelphia was one of the cities where gentrification was most rampant.</p>

<p>In recent years, it’s become popular among some Democrats to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/americas-formerly-redlines-areas-changed-so-must-solutions/">tout proposals</a> that will remedy segregation caused by redlining. But Taylor told us that these measures often fail to account for how the maps have changed over time. For instance, in Philadelphia, young white people have been able to move into historically Black neighborhoods and buy homes by <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/gentrification-became-low-income-lending-laws-unintended-consequence/">using programs</a> associated with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which was intended to remedy the damage of redlining. In fact, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/half-century-federal-oversight-segregated-neighborhoods-pervasive-abc/story?id=82678035">per an ABC News analysis</a>, it’s now easier for white people than people of color to buy homes in historically nonwhite neighborhoods. In 2019, 65 percent of the 347,000 white homebuyers who applied for mortgages in mostly nonwhite neighborhoods in the country’s largest metro areas were approved, compared with 56 percent of 715,000 nonwhite homebuyers who received a loan in those same neighborhoods.</p>
<p>What’s more, Taylor said, simply encouraging homeownership <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philly-just-challenged-an-infamous-slumlord-to-a-legal-death-match-and-won/">in neighborhoods like East Germantown</a>, where the housing stock is old and dilapidated, could saddle Black Americans with debt. Without being able to fund repairs or escape long, predatory mortgages, these programs could exacerbate the housing crisis and push more Black people out of their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>“There’s no money to be made in affordable housing, and so all the building that is happening now are million-dollar condos, because that’s where the money is,” Taylor said.</p>
<p>Some 40 years after the first redlining map was drawn, redlining was banned under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But in many ways, HOLC and the Federal Housing Administration had already written the textbook for racist real estate practices.</p>
<p>“[The Fair Housing Act of 1968] doesn’t roll back or undo or make amends for 50 years of housing discrimination that had gone on up to that point,” said Winling, the Virginia Tech historian involved in the Mapping Inequality project. “It’s going to take probably another 80 or 90 years of vigorous enforcement and vigorous remediation to undo that legacy.”</p>
<p>The legacy of redlining extends far beyond housing segregation, too. Its impact can be seen today in minority neighborhoods’ access to <a href="https://ncrc.org/holc-health/">health care</a>, poorer <a href="https://www.edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai21-363.pdf">educational opportunties</a>, and increased risk of climate change, as many of these areas are more prone to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-flood-risk-redlining/">flooding</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html">extreme heat</a>. Without a serious confrontation of its lasting generational damage, the racial segregation caused by redlining isn’t going anywhere either.</p>
<p>“I look at it as: Redlining happened. It was an important part of American history,” Perry said. “And we must reckon with the behaviors and the outcomes in ways that never discount what redlining did. And again, it has different stories for different cities, but redlining is a part of that story. It just is.”</p>

<p>Redlining maps used in this project were originally drawn by the now-defunct Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) from 1935-40 and downloaded from the <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining">Mapping Inequality</a> project. Individual HOLC zones that fall within the same metropolitan area were grouped according to <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/geographies/reference-files/2020/delineation-files/list1_2020.xls">census micro- or metropolitan area definitions</a>.6 A small number of HOLC zones fractionally overlapped in source map shapefiles; these overlaps were carved out of the geographically larger zone.7</p>
<p>Population and race/ethnicity data comes from the 2020 U.S. decennial census. Population counts were aggregated from census blocks, which are the smallest geographic census units and offer the most precision when matching census data to other geographic shapes. HOLC zones were matched to census data by first determining which census blocks geographically intersected with each zone. Data from all matching blocks was then weighted by the proportion of the block’s total area that intersects with that HOLC zone and summed to estimate the 2020 demographic makeup of each HOLC zone.</p>
<p>The surrounding area for each metropolitan area’s HOLC map was computed by adding a 10 percent buffer radius to the combined zones in that metropolitan area.8 Surrounding area population totals were then computed by summing census-block population data, weighted by the proportion of each block’s total area contained within the surrounding area’s border.</p>
<p>For each metropolitan area’s HOLC map, a <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/technical-appendix#footnote34_cnxakh3">location quotient (LQ)</a> — a small-area measure of segregation that specifically compares one racial/ethnic group’s proportion in a granular geography to its proportion in a larger surrounding geography — was calculated for combined A-, B-, C- and D-rated zones for each racial/ethnic group. An LQ above 1 for a given racial group indicates overrepresentation in that HOLC zone compared with the broader surrounding area, and values below 1 indicate underrepresentation. A metropolitan area’s HOLC zones were defined as segregated for a minority racial/ethnic group if: (1) its LQ in D-rated zones was greater than 1 (suggesting this group was overrepresented in redlined areas); (2) its LQ in D-rated zones was greater than its LQ in A-rated zones (suggesting this group was more represented in redlined areas than in greenlined areas); and (3) its LQ in A-rated zones was smaller than the white population’s LQ in A-rated zones (suggesting this group was not more represented in greenlined areas than the white population).</p>
<p>Population density dots were generated for each racial/ethnic group within a census block, with each dot representing one person. Dots were placed randomly within a census block and do not represent exact locations but rather the total population of a given race/ethnicity in that block. White, Black and Asian data excludes those who indicated Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Hispanic/Latino data includes all who indicated Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, regardless of race. Other race data includes all population counts that did not fall under white, Black, Asian or Latino. The Albers Equal-Area Conic projection, which guarantees areas on one map are equivalent to areas on another map, was used for all maps and spatial calculations.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It didn’t take long after Justice Stephen Breyer <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire/story?id=74363429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his retirement</a> for conservative politicians and pundits to criticize <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-stands-pledge-nominate-black-woman-supreme-court/story?id=82487044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s campaign pledge</a> to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas denounced Biden’s promise as “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cruz-joins-republicans-slamming-bidens-vow-black-woman/story?id=82583224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offensive</a>” while GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/gop-sen-wicker-compares-biden-s-supreme-court-pledge-affirmative-n1288211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preemptively dismissed</a> the prospective nominee as benefitting from a racially discriminatory “quota.” On Fox News, Sean Hannity <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/hannity-biden-black-female-scotus-pick-identity-politics-steroids-unconstitutional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slammed</a> Biden’s pledge as “identity politics on steroids.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/reagan-example-republicans-have-conveniently-forgotten-n1288233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-fox-news-biden-black-woman-supreme-court-1293781/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">astute</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/04/1078358077/republicans-take-issue-with-bidens-pledge-to-pick-a-black-woman-for-supreme-cour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/biden-supreme-court-nominee-smear-campaign/621408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promptly</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidents-factored-race-gender-ethnicity-scotus-picks/story?id=82585364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a> that Republicans haven’t objected to prior presidents’ pledges to nominate a woman to the Supreme Court. There was no equivalent outcry, for instance, when President Ronald Reagan vowed to appoint <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/10/15/reagan-pledges-he-would-name-a-woman-to-the-supreme-court/844817dc-27aa-4f5d-8e4f-0ab3a5e76865/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first woman to the Supreme Court</a> during the 1980 presidential campaign — a promise he fulfilled the following year by nominating Sandra Day O’Connor. Nor was their condemnation of former President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/20/trump-vows-to-nominate-a-woman-for-us-supreme-court-vacancy-within-a-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledge</a> to nominate a woman to fill the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat in September 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Stanford professor and FiveThirtyEight contributor, Hakeem Jefferson, <a href="https://twitter.com/hakeemjefferson/status/1487448727870590979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>, “Conservatives didn’t get upset when Trump promised to nominate a woman to the bench because the qualifier ‘white’ was simply implied.” He later <a href="https://twitter.com/hakeemjefferson/status/1487841389022879745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that it’s the misogynoir, or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2020/09/22/misogynoir-the-unique-discrimination-that-black-women-face/?sh=9c858a256ef6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unique biases Black women experience</a>, not the pledge, that is the problem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling data certainly seems to support Jefferson’s argument. Take, for example, Republican responses to the two YouGov polling questions about the importance of nominating a woman and the importance of nominating a <em>Black</em> woman to fill vacated SCOTUS seats in 2020 and 2022, respectively.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Republicans wanted Trump to nominate a woman in 2020" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WEDYN/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="252" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">The chart above shows that more than half of Republicans and over three-quarters of Democrats thought it was important to have a female justice replace Ginsburg in a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/o6p3vjhvnt/20200924_yahoo_coronavirus_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2020 YouGov/Yahoo Poll</a> conducted a few days before Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to fill her seat. But while a similarly large share of Democrats said it’s very or somewhat important to have a Black woman replace Breyer in a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/01/26/ed5f0/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2022 YouGov survey</a>, only 13 percent of Republicans said the same about Biden nominating a Black woman.      </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, there are other factors that may be driving Republicans’ divergent responses in that chart besides including the word “Black” before woman in the 2022 polling. Trump’s 2020 nominee, after all, was filling a Supreme Court seat held for over a quarter-century by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feminist icon</a>, who was only the second woman to ever serve on the high court. That could have easily amplified the importance of nominating a woman more than replacing Breyer, a male justice.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the January 2022 poll mentions Biden’s pledge before asking about the importance of nominating a Black woman; and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;political science research&lt;/a&gt; has found that providing such information about the president’s positions often increases opposition from the other party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet there are good reasons to nonetheless suspect that Republicans are uniquely opposed to presidential pledges in support of African Americans — especially when they’re made by Democratic presidents. In fact, a similar pattern emerged in a <a href="https://doi.roper.center/?doi=10.25940/ROPER-31095452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2009 CNN/ORC poll</a>, which asked respondents to rate the importance of race and gender in then-President Barack Obama’s forthcoming pick to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice David Souter’s retirement. Just 14 percent of Republicans said it was important Obama nominate an African American to the Supreme Court. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, <em>both</em> Democrats and Republicans were nearly twice as likely to say it was important for Obama to pick a woman than they were to say it was important for him to nominate an African American to the Supreme Court, as you can see in the chart below. But unlike Democrats who have experienced a sharp uptick in the share who think a Black person should be nominated to the court since 2009, the share of Republicans who agree is practically unchanged.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="In 2009, both parties prioritized a female over a Black justice" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/shV50/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="235" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is yet another reminder of the <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/racing-apart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarkable shift partisans’ racial attitudes have undergone in the past decade</a>. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-and-democrats-increasingly-agree-on-the-protests-but-not-why-people-are-protesting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-2020-could-shape-the-conversation-on-race-in-the-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show</a> that the share of white Democrats who view systemic racism as an impediment to Black progress has skyrocketed in recent years. It’s no surprise, then, that the <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/new-polls-most-americans-support-biden-nominating-black-woman-to-supreme-court-but-only-19-percent-of-republicans/https:/www.mediaite.com/news/new-polls-most-americans-support-biden-nominating-black-woman-to-supreme-court-but-only-19-percent-of-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelming majority of Democrats (82 percent) support</a> “President Biden’s plan to nominate a Black woman to the United States Supreme Court” — especially when Democratic leadership frames the nomination as combatting the same structural biases that have excluded African American women from the high court throughout the nation’s history.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans, meanwhile, have moved in the opposite direction on race. As I wrote in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-rise-of-white-identity-politics-explains-the-fight-over-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous piece for FiveThirtyEight</a>, GOP politics are increasingly animated by the belief that anti-white discrimination is as big of a problem in American society as biases against racial and ethnic minorities. Those views helped <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/03/how-political-science-helps-explain-the-rise-of-trump-the-role-of-white-identity-and-grievances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fuel Trump’s rise within the party</a>; and they factor heavily into conservatives’ mischaracterization of critical race theory, an academic framework that<a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> helps explain how <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racism permeates American institutions</a>, as an anti-white “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existential threat to the United States</a>.” <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/9uqg6clnvr/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Few Trump voters (19 percent) approve</a> of Biden’s pledge — especially when prominent Republicans frame it as a racially discriminatory appointment of an unqualified justice who doesn’t “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vpey/gop-senator-thinks-bidens-scotus-nominee-wont-know-a-law-book-from-a-j-crew-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know a law book from a J. Crew catalog</a>.” That is, of course, patently false as FiveThirtyEight’s Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux and Elena Mejía wrote in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-bidens-appointees-can-tell-us-about-his-supreme-court-nominee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent analysis of Biden’s judicial appointees so far</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But understanding the power racial grievances have in GOP politics today goes a long way in understanding why Republicans are so strongly opposed to Biden’s pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. As Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2022/02/02/republicans-cant-agree-on-a-scotus-strategy-00004536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a>, “I want a nominee who’s not going to try to rewrite the Constitution every other Thursday to try to advance a ‘woke agenda.’” And undoubtedly, the race, gender and partisanship of Biden’s prospective pick all intersect with one another to heighten these Republican fears of “wokeness” run amok in ways that nominees of other identities almost certainly would not.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Are there really more Americans identifying as Republicans than Democrats now? For decades, more Americans <a href="https://electionstudies.org/resources/anes-guide/top-tables/?id=22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tended to identify</a> as Democrats than as Republicans, even if the gap has sometimes been small. But in January, Gallup found that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans had taken the lead</a> in party ID during the last three months of 2021: On average, 47 percent identified as a Republican or said they leaned toward the GOP, while 42 percent identified as a Democrat or leaned toward the Democratic Party. Given we’re headed into what will be a competitive midterm election year, this finding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/opinion/gallup-poll-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparked a flurry</a> of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/18/1073774921/americans-political-party-preferences-shifted-to-republicans-in-recent-months" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headlines in the days</a> following <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-shifts-party-preference-from-democratic-to-republican-in-2021-with-gop-holding-largest-lead-since-1995" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the release of Gallup’s report</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s still too soon to know whether more Americans are actually identifying as Republicans. Gallup’s finding could portend a lasting change, or it could also be a short-term reaction to an unpopular Democratic president, or it could be an artifact of lower response rates by Democrats frustrated with bad news for their party — or it could relate to all of the above. After all, political science research has found that <a href="https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-72?print=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an individual’s party identification can fluctuate</a>. That said, party ID also tends to be pretty stable in the long run, such that we’d expect changes across the population to be gradual.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To that point, there are two ways of looking at Gallup’s party ID data: quarterly and annually. In the quarterly data, you can see that party ID is volatile. In general, it favors Democrats, but there are numerous spikes in the data as well as instances when Republicans have had the advantage. In the yearly data, meanwhile, it’s easier to see that more Americans have consistently identified as Democrats than Republicans, although there were periods in the early 2000s and early 2010s when party ID was more evenly matched — perhaps not coincidentally, those years featured strong Republican electoral performances — and in 1991 when Republicans even held an advantage, thanks in part to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/234971/george-bush-retrospective.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very popular GOP president</a> in the White House.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1036" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley-radcliffe.PARTY-ID.0201DESK.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley-radcliffe.PARTY-ID.0201DESK.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley-radcliffe.PARTY-ID.0201DESK.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley-radcliffe.PARTY-ID.0201DESK.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="1828" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley-radcliffe.PARTY-ID.0201MOBILE.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley-radcliffe.PARTY-ID.0201MOBILE.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley-radcliffe.PARTY-ID.0201MOBILE.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/skelley-radcliffe.PARTY-ID.0201MOBILE.png?w=1240 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And that’s what makes interpreting party ID data so hard. Annual Gallup data suggests that the most recent quarterly numbers might have been a blip and that we should expect Democratic party ID <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/kaplan.park.gelman.110728.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to rebound soon</a>. After all, in the last 30 years, Gallup’s annual data has found, on average, that 47 percent of Americans identified as Democrats versus 42 percent as Republicans (including independents who leaned toward each party). Then again, it’s possible that this quarterly data is pointing to a longer-lasting gain in party ID for Republicans, as was the case in the early 2000s and 2010s. This could have potentially major consequences for the upcoming midterm election, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912918784215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research published in 2018</a>, political scientists Patrick Tucker, Jacob Montgomery and Steven Smith used longitudinal data from the <a href="https://wc.wustl.edu/american-panel-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Panel Survey</a> to study partisan identification from 2011 to 2016, finding that changes in presidential approval and favorability of the two parties often preceded changes in party affiliation in the short term, particularly among Americans who did not have strong ties to their party. Considering that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s job approval</a> has suffered in recent months, it could be that the short-term changes we see in Gallup’s data indeed indicate the electorate’s movement away from the Democratic Party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Along the same lines, <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/about-the-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Franklin</a>, the director of the Marquette Law School poll, recently analyzed <a href="https://pollsandvotes.com/?p=217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movement in party ID across a number of major pollsters</a>, and he broadly found a decrease in those identifying as Democratic — although not the same degree of swing toward the GOP as in Gallup’s quarterly data. However, it is worth noting that Franklin was looking at party ID that did <em>not</em> include independents that lean toward a party, because many pollsters don’t publish party ID data with leaners. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, that study by Tucker, Montgomery and Smith also found that changes in party ID tended to revert over time as voters’ evaluations of the parties and the president stabilize, so the initial movement we see in Gallup’s data may not last. In fact, Gallup found the two parties were running close to even in December, perhaps suggesting that the shift toward the GOP was already abating.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This tendency for people to shift their party ID in the short term only to then <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/04/voters-rarely-switch-parties-but-recent-shifts-further-educational-racial-divergence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revert back</a> is evident in the Pew Research Center’s party ID numbers, which are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very similar overall to Gallup’s yearly numbers</a>. For instance, between September 2018 and July 2020, Pew found that about one in five Americans in their <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/our-methods/u-s-surveys/the-american-trends-panel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Trends Panel</a> made some change to their party identification, but nearly nine in 10 identified or leaned toward the same party in 2020 as in 2018. In other words, nearly half of those who had switched parties ultimately switched back.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes those who switched between the parties, and those who switched to independent and then switched back to their previous party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And of course, as is the case anytime we’re talking about polling, there are methodological differences among pollsters that can further muddy the waters of how Americans see themselves in the political landscape. As Marquette Law School’s Franklin noted, differences in question wording can contribute to differences in partisan identification; Gallup’s party ID question <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asks respondents</a> how they identify “as of today,” for instance, whereas <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21182470-220027-survey-1-20-22-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some other pollsters</a> ask <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us01122022_demos_ubjw88.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how respondents</a> identify “generally speaking.” And in a <a href="https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/AbramsonOstromAPSR1991.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1991 study</a>, political scientists Paul Abramson and Charles Ostrom found that from 1952 to 1988, Gallup’s version of the question did produce more volatility in party ID than other pollsters’ versions of this question. That may still be the case, considering that Franklin found smaller shifts among other pollsters’ versions of this question in January.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that the large swing in party ID toward the GOP that Gallup observed could be partly due to Democratic-leaning Americans responding at lower rates. Democrats might have been more discouraged by what’s going on in Washington, what with Biden’s dismal approval rating and Democrats having failed to pass their much-ballyhooed social spending and voting rights legislation. There’s even a term for this — <a href="https://www.formpl.us/blog/response-non-response-bias#:~:text=Non-response%20bias%20is%20a,for%20the%20lack%20of%20response." target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonresponse bias</a> — and we’ve seen it happen before: Lower response rates among Republican-leaning voters ahead of the 2020 election <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/13/politics/2020-polling-error-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have contributed</a> to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling error</a> that underestimated GOP support. But it’s also possible that some pollsters are weighting their polls in ways that could diminish the impact of nonresponse bias or other short-term factors. For instance, YouGov <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/idsbkknia1/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weights its polls to match</a> the 2016 and 2020 election results, which means that while they <a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1485632944463036424?s=20&amp;t=fMW-rcvwguf44mK78i2wjg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also found a Republican-leaning trend</a> in party ID across 2021, the magnitude of that shift was much, much smaller.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouGov conducts online polls using &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/06/what-are-nonprobability-surveys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nonprobability samples&lt;/a&gt;. This means their samples aren’t totally random, but it’s possible their approach of using past presidential results to weight results may be less error-prone than other methods. For instance, a 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2016/05/02/assessing-the-accuracy-of-online-nonprobability-surveys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pew study&lt;/a&gt; compared the error of different nonprobability surveys, and it found that a sample weighted by party ID — similar to YouGov’s practice of weighting to past presidential vote — produced the smallest amount of polling error across a number of known benchmarks. But Pew did flag some concerns regarding online pollsters using such approaches — specifically, if done poorly, weighting by a predetermined result could unduly influence other findings in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, it’s probably too early to say how much of the Republican shift in partisan identification is real, or how long it will last. However, it’s also not clear whether this particular data point tells us much more about the electorate than we already know from Biden’s job approval, generic congressional ballot polling and other political polls. In their study, Abramson and Ostrom did show that party identification polls were moderately predictive of electoral outcomes for the House and presidency, but direct measures such as the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> and head-to-head polling are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still much better indicators</a> of what to expect in elections. All things considered, this may be just one more data point that directs us toward what we already expect: Things are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking pretty tough</a> for the Democrats in November.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">We are approaching the two-year mark of living with the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Though the omicron wave is receding, the virus will unlikely just disappear, and people are unhappy and angry — about COVID-19 and plenty else. In surveys, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/record-number-of-americans-report-being-unhappy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Americans</a> are saying they’re unhappy in their own lives, about two-thirds think the country is on the <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrong track</a>, and Biden is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?ex_cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a percentage point away</a> from Trump’s record for being the least popular postwar president at this point in his term. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses how Americans are feeling and which types of COVID-19 restrictions they do and don’t support. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The podcast also covers some big recent developments in the redistricting process happening around the country now. New York signed into law a map that aggressively advantages Democrats, and elsewhere, state and federal courts have struck down maps they consider gerrymanders.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For a few years now, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/934631994/bidens-win-shows-rural-urban-divide-has-grown-since-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly Republican</a> politics of rural America has struck a nerve for Democrats who call it home. But in the summer of 2020, when tens of thousands of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swarmed the streets</a> to protest racism and police violence, tensions were particularly high between one of those progressive residents and a female neighbor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“She approached me in my driveway and said she had some information for me,” Rob B., a 56-year-old who lives in rural Arizona, recalled of the encounter. “She informed me that she had purchased a pistol from the local gun shop for $75 to protect herself because the ‘news’ was reporting that antifa and [Black Lives Matter] were going to start ‘raiding’ rural towns.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rob B., who prefers to use only his first name and last initial out of privacy concerns, said he tried to convince his neighbor, a Republican, that no protesters were coming, which he said seemed to relieve her even if she wasn’t entirely convinced. And of course, despite some conservative social media accounts <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/antifa-rumors-spread-local-social-media-no-evidence-n1222486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushing versions of this story</a> at the time, no one “bad” did come to their town. But it was around then that Rob B. said he started to notice an explosion of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/09/the-short-fraught-history-of-the-thin-blue-line-american-flag-309767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thin-blue-line bumper stickers and flags</a> — a symbol originally meant to signify support for law enforcement. “They were suddenly everywhere,” he said. And as a speck of blue in a red political sea, he felt completely outnumbered. “Even though Biden supporters live here, too, the Trump people are more outspoken, louder, bigger and in complete excess.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, it’s not that surprising Rob B.’s neighbors are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-other-conservatives-embrace-blue-lives-matter-movement-n615156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more conservative</a> than he is. For the past fifteen years or so, rural America has <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily trended red</a>, with former President Trump winning rural voters over President Biden in 2020 by more than 30 percentage points, according to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>. In fact, given Republicans’ <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002716217712696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued dominance</a> in rural America, Democrats have largely abandoned trying to win voters who reside there, opting instead to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-rural-voters-midterm-elections-2024-culture-2021-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus their resources</a> on bluer cities and suburbs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This political maneuvering was driven in part by the fact that the U.S. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550621994000#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has increasingly sorted itself</a> along geographic lines, with Republicans living in more rural areas <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-3-political-polarization-and-personal-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Democrats in cities</a>. This has changed how the two parties compete for votes, but another effect is that many of the rural Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters I spoke with feel like outsiders — or even unsafe — in their own homes. Many reported believing that their party had mostly given up on campaigning in their parts of the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To that end, I wanted to better understand why some rural residents vote Democratic when nearly everyone around them votes Republican. I also wanted to discuss how comfortable they feel discussing their political views with their neighbors. To do this, I spoke with five rural-dwelling voters who are either Democrats or overwhelmingly support Democratic policies. I learned that most feel they have drastically differing political priorities from their neighbors, while others feel they <em>must</em> keep their beliefs to themselves for fear of violence or retribution. And lastly, some told me they don’t currently have the means, or don’t want, to leave Trump country — rather, they wish Democrats would start treating their hometowns the same way Democrats treat battleground states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I have yet to see a sign for any Democrat running for office in my area or my district for 2022,” said Ian C., a 32-year-old living in Georgia who uses gender-neutral pronouns and prefers to be identified without their surname. “It really doesn’t seem like Democrats care about this area too much, even though they should. I think there are a lot of working-class people here who would resonate with the right message.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least in the short-term, though, Ian C.’s wishes might be futile. One of the reasons Democrats often fail to seriously contest — let alone win — state-legislative and congressional seats in much of rural America is because the issues that animate <em>their </em>base can be off-putting to many rural voters. Many of the Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters I spoke with said that the issues they prioritized — like climate change, election integrity and racial justice — weren’t top of mind for their neighbors. And in rare cases, confrontations erupted when my interviewees had tried to start discussions about policy or political issues important to them.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1506" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As the chart above shows, rural Americans, on average, tend to hold more conservative views than their urban counterparts. For example, on immigration, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew found in 2018</a> that Republicans and Republican-leaners living in rural areas were more likely than their urban and suburban counterparts to see a growing immigrant population as a threat to “traditional American customs and values.” And on racial justice issues, rural residents were the <em>least </em>likely to think that white Americans benefit from societal advantages that Black citizens don’t have. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But policy isn’t the only arena where rural Democrats and their neighbors are at odds. Views toward Trump have been another dividing line. In that same 2018 survey, Pew found that rural Republicans and Republican-leaners were more likely than their suburban and urban counterparts to have “very warm” feelings toward the former president — which has led some Democrats to feel they have a moral obligation to call out perceived injustices from Trump and his supporters, even if they’re not being provoked.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, the day after the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/reflections-on-the-jan-6-insurrection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol</a>, Rob B. said there were two separate occasions when he called people in his neighborhood either a “Nazi” or a “traitor” after he saw them donning “Make America Great Again” hats. He said his knee-jerk reaction wasn’t because these people merely supported Trump, but because, in his telling, “they were making a point to flaunt support the day after one of the worst days in America’s history.” To me, he compared these MAGA-hat-wearing neighbors to “folks who make a point to go out in full NRA garb the day after a major shooting in the U.S. — something I definitely also see here.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Camellia El-Antably of Wyoming, 47, also felt she needed to say something to a neighbor who used to sell guns near where she worked. “Shortly after a major shooting, I told her something to the effect of ‘I believe that gun control is important.’ She got really angry and thought I was trying to denigrate her business or something,” she said to me. “Finally, I wrote her a note apologizing, and after that, it was OK. We’re definitely not friends, but we’re not enemies either.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the most part, though, these political differences left many of the people I spoke with believing it no longer made sense to talk politics to their neighbors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A while back, a couple of friends and I agreed that we would never change each other’s minds,” said Carol D., a 71-year-old Texan who wants to use only her first name and last initial out of privacy concerns. “It’s a little awkward because one of them is crazy about Trump, and I lost respect for her because of that. To be honest, I wouldn’t be surprised if she felt the same way about me.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it wasn’t always like this. For the rural Democrats I spoke with, the turning point was the <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/10/31/the-republican-party-has-lurched-towards-populism-and-illiberalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Party</a>’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-senators-and-representatives-vote-in-favor-of-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing illiberalism</a> in recent years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In the 20 years we’ve been here, there was a dramatic change starting in 2015, when Trump announced his run for president,” said Donald Wright, a 52-year-old Virginian. “I think often about how much of it was under the surface versus what people now feel and are able to express freely. So maybe the feelings were there pre-Trump, but the more blatant hostility wasn’t always there.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, part of that perceived hostility likely stems from the fact that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/30/opinion/politics/bubble-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geographic political segregation</a> leaves Democrats living in red areas (and Republicans in blue ones) feeling more out of place than ever before. And another part could be the fact that the most staunch conservatives are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/faith-and-flag-conservatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to live in rural areas</a>. Worryingly, what it means to be a conservative is also increasingly tangled up in a lack of respect for democracy.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1512" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As a result of current attitudes within the GOP, some rural Democrats now feel both alone in their politics and that they need to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/the-democratic-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat falsehoods</a> that their own party consists primarily of socialists and those with far-left politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As a progressive in these areas, it is mostly about trying to normalize that we aren’t all three-headed child cannibals but rather actual neighbors and parts of the community,” Wright said. “We aren’t going to be directly changing hearts and minds, but we can hope to help break down stereotypes.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite what many described as a currently stressful living situation, most people I spoke to said they couldn’t see themselves leaving anytime soon. They listed several reasons for this: owning a home, having a steady in-person job and/or having children currently in school. They also haven’t given up hope that Democrats will eventually show interest in their neck of the woods. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The Democratic Party is not very strong here,” El-Antably told me. “It’s very hard for them to field enough candidates, and as a result, there’s lots of times when Republicans run for statewide office unopposed or the Democrat running is weak, unable to raise enough money or doesn’t run a strong campaign.” She added that this had led some of her Democratic friends to register as Republicans to vote in a GOP primary so they could “vote for the least-worst Republican.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The imminent problem for Democrats, though, is that rural America has recently drifted further from them than urban America has moved away<em> </em>from Republicans. From 1999 to 2019, urban areas moved 9 points toward Democrats, while rural areas swung 13 points toward Republicans, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Pew survey released in 2020</a>. (The suburbs remained essentially tied over that same span of time.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means the Democratic Party will surely need to expand their base — which could include actively campaigning in redder parts of the nation. And if the Democrats I spoke to had one message they wanted to convey to their party, it’s to not give up on them and to take rural America seriously even if there’s not an election around the corner. Ian C., for example, noticed that Democrats stopped making regular campaign stops in Georgia after the party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/georgia-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nabbed two competitive Senate seats</a> last year. “I’m not a politician, but it seems like common sense: If you want to focus on winning Georgia again and keeping it blue, you have to invest in this,” they said. “The Democratic Party only cares about you if you’re a battleground or if you’re marginally safe. And that’s frustrating. It’s part of the reason why I often contemplate the point of voting.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Ian C. told me, Georgia is their home: “It’s cheap here, and it’s quiet. I bought my first home here.” And even though it might be easy to assume that Democrats living in rural America don’t mean much electorally, since their votes are often overshadowed by Republicans, the residents I spoke to were steadfast that their party shouldn’t throw in the towel with rural America. “Moving won’t change the fact the county is divided, and God forbid, the worst happens. We have to rely on each other when things do happen,” they said. “We have to be willing to try.”</p>]]></description>

			<title>Americans Are Increasingly Meh On The Olympics</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Did you tune into (or are you currently watching) the opening ceremonies for the Winter Olympics Friday morning? Did you even realize the opening ceremonies were happening? If not, you’re not alone. Polling shows enthusiasm for the Games is muted, and while the Winter Games <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/en/SB-Blogs/COVID19-OpEds/2022/02/02-Erickson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are typically not as popular</a> as Summer Games in the U.S., the fact that the Olympics are being held in China doesn’t help. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">American interest in the Games is lower than it has been in the past. According to an <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/us-and-global-public-attitudes-2022-beijing-winter-olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos poll</a> conducted ​​Dec. 23–Jan. 7, 42 percent of adults said they were interested in the upcoming Games, compared with 55 percent ahead of the last Winter Olympics, in 2018. Just 45 percent of American adults said they planned to watch some or a lot of the Olympics, according to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/31/beijing-olympics-viewership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 25-27. That’s roughly the same as the percentage who said they planned to watch the Summer Games in Tokyo last year, though that marked a record low for viewership intent according to the pollster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reasons for that dip are mysterious and multifaceted. Of those who told Morning Consult that they don’t plan to watch, 65 percent said it was because they aren’t interested in the events, and 57 percent said it’s because they aren’t interested in the athletes (13 percent, meanwhile, blamed the time zone difference). There are likely a number of underlying factors provoking this lack of interest: For one thing, the last Olympic Games were just six months ago, so there may be a bit of event fatigue since the Games are typically spaced out every two years. There’s also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/sports/tv-ratings-sports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a general decline</a> in TV ratings for sports in recent years. And, as mentioned above, the Winter Olympics tend to be a tougher sell for American audiences compared with the Summer Games. Meanwhile, 40 percent in the Morning Consult poll said they don’t plan to watch the Olympics this year because they are opposed to China hosting the Games, and 31 percent cited it as a “major” reason.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a politics column, so let’s focus on that stat a bit. Americans’ views toward China have become more chilly in recent years: a Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey last February</a> found 67 percent of U.S. adults felt very or somewhat “cold” toward China, up from 46 percent in 2018. Among Republicans, those feelings were stronger, with 79 percent of Republicans feeling the chill. In a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/31/more-adults-approve-than-disapprove-of-u-s-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics-few-have-heard-much-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center survey</a> conducted Jan. 10-17 this year, Americans were more likely to say that, on balance, they consider China a competitor rather than an enemy, but among Republicans that trend reversed: 52 percent of Republicans said China was an enemy, compared with 40 percent who considered the nation a competitor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The choice to host the Games in Beijing has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/20/1074500316/as-the-olympics-near-activists-criticize-chinas-alleged-human-rights-violations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contentious due to China’s human rights record</a>, including <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/19/break-their-lineage-break-their-roots/chinas-crimes-against-humanity-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abuse and violence</a> against ethnic and religious minorities in the country, such as predominantly Muslim Uyghurs. In response to the criticism, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/06/2022-winter-olympics-biden-announces-diplomatic-boycott-beijing/8837884002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Biden administration</a> chose not to send an official delegation to the Games (as did <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nations-holding-diplomatic-boycott-beijing-games/story?id=82461768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of other</a> nations), a kind of “diplomatic boycott.” In a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/2/2/the-us-diplomatic-boycott-against-the-beijing-olympics-is-popular-with-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted by Data for Progress</a> from Dec. 15-18 (shortly after the boycott was announced), 67 percent of likely voters supported the decision not to send a delegation, and a plurality of American adults either somewhat or strongly approved of the boycott, according to the January Pew survey. But that Pew survey also showed just 9 percent of adults had heard a lot about it. In fact, 45 percent hadn’t heard anything about the boycott at all. Among those who had heard a lot about it, 69 percent approved of the decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some Americans want U.S. corporations to take a stand as well. When asked whether they think “companies should withdraw their advertisements for the February 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in response to human rights violations by the Chinese government,” 54 percent of U.S. adults said probably or definitely yes, according to a <a href="https://static.grid.news/NationalTrackingPolls/2201140_topline_GRID_BEIJING_OLYMPICS_Adults_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grid/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 22-23. Just 34 percent of U.S. adults somewhat or strongly support brands or companies sponsoring the Olympics, according to a separate <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/01/olympic-sponsors-china-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 29-31, while 58 percent would support brands pulling out of the Games. However, brands might be able to win support simply by issuing a statement condemning China’s actions: 55 percent of U.S. adults said they would support such a move. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, though, Americans still stand behind athletes who chose to attend the Games: 63 percent said they support U.S. athletes participating in the Games, according to that Grid/Morning Consult poll. It captures a sentiment that has been commonly expressed in the run-up to the Games: It’s fair to criticize the International Olympic Committee for selecting China as a host, and it’s fair to criticize China for its history. But many argue there’s no need to punish the athletes, for whom the chance to compete at the highest level is often a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. One that, judging by the polling, many Americans won’t see.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>According to a Jan. 21-24 Data for Progress poll of likely voters, 58 percent said they would support the Biden administration <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/1/27/a-majority-of-voters-support-biden-striking-a-deal-with-russia-to-avoid-war-in-ukraine">striking a diplomatic deal with Russia</a> to avoid war with Ukraine. Democrats, in particular, favored diplomacy, with 71 percent in favor. A slight plurality (46 percent) of Republicans agreed. However, when Americans were asked in a Jan. 28-29 ABC News/Ipsos poll about the U.S. <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/president-biden-continues-lose-ground-american-public">sending troops to eastern Europe</a> to try to discourage Russia from invading Ukraine, respondents were split: 38 percent said they opposed sending troops, 29 percent supported it and 32 percent said they didn’t know.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans’ views of the economy are still mostly pessimistic. According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx">Jan. 3-16 poll by Gallup</a>, 67 percent said they thought the economy was getting worse versus 29 percent who said it was getting better. They did find one bright spot, though: the job market. A 43 percent plurality predicted that the unemployment rate would decrease over the next six months. In addition, 72 percent said now was a good time to get a quality job — among the highest figures the pollster has recorded since it began tracking the question in 2001.</li></ul><ul><li>The majority of parents of school-age children (67 percent) believe that pandemic-related educational disruptions have put their children <a href="https://civicscience.com/majority-of-parents-say-kids-are-behind-academically-right-now-except-for-this-group/">somewhat or very behind in school</a>, according to a Jan. 19-26 CivicScience poll. And while children from higher-income families <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12187-020-09782-0">generally perform better in school</a>, parents who made more than $125,000 a year were more likely (80 percent) to believe the pandemic put their children behind educationally than those who made less than $35,000 a year (65 percent).</li></ul><ul><li>While there’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">widespread support</a> for the Biden administration’s decision to mail free at-home COVID-19 tests to anyone who wants one, fewer than half (47 percent) were able to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/01/31/who-requested-free-home-covid-tests-government">successfully request one</a>. In a Jan. 22-25 Economist/YouGov poll, fully vaccinated adults were much more likely to have successfully requested an at-home COVID-19 test (54 percent) compared with those who say they will not get the jab (27 percent). Instead, a majority (70 percent) of unvaccinated adults said they hadn’t tried to request one.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans are largely satisfied with their own lives but dissatisfied with the direction of the country as a whole. Eighty-five percent said they were very or somewhat satisfied with how things were going in their personal lives, while just 17 percent said the same for the United States, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389375/satisfaction-own-life-five-times-higher.aspx">according to Gallup</a>. People with an annual household income of $100,000 or more and those who attend religious services weekly were most likely to report satisfaction with their personal lives (at 94 and 92 percent, respectively). While nonwhite people (27 percent) and Democrats (30 percent) were the most likely to be satisfied with the direction of the country, just 12 percent of white people and just 4 percent of Republicans said the same.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Latino voters swung by <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8 percentage points</a> toward then-President Donald Trump in the last election, the largest swing of any racial or ethnic group in the electorate. Last April, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-will-trumps-gains-with-latino-voters-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a> spoke with the team at <a href="https://www.equisresearch.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equis Research</a>, a political data firm focusing on Latino voters, about <em>what</em> exactly happened. As to the question of <em>why</em> voters swung, the answer was, in large part, that we needed more data. Now we have more data! In this installment of the podcast, Equis’s co-founders share <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/61b7e8e75c74f5558036268b/1639442667560/Post-Mortem+Part+Two+FINAL+Dec+13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what they found</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Feb. 7, 5:43 p.m. Eastern):</strong> On Feb. 7, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a375_d18f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinstated</a> the congressional map passed by Alabama’s Republican-controlled legislature for the 2022 elections, pending a final decision on the merits of the case at a later date. The court’s ultimate ruling could still have broad implications for the Voting Rights Act’s protections against racial gerrymandering.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">On Jan. 24, Alabama became the second state (after Ohio) to have its new congressional map <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/24/alabama-congressional-map-blocked-federal-court/9205925002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down in court</a>. But while Ohio’s map was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ohios-overturned-congressional-map-shows-how-lawsuits-might-scramble-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thrown out</a> by the state Supreme Court for violating the state constitution, Alabama’s was overturned by three federal judges who determined the map short-changed Black voters of representation in Congress. That’s a significant difference because it will require the Supreme Court to weigh in, potentially reshaping federal law in the process. As a result, the ruling could reverberate far beyond Alabama. It could open the door for increased nonwhite representation in other states, too — if it holds up on appeal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a refresher, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rucho-v-common-cause-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled in 2019</a> that partisan gerrymandering was a political question that federal courts should not adjudicate. However, they can still hear cases relating to <em>racial</em> gerrymandering — i.e., whether a map discriminates against voters of a certain race. Alabama poses just such a question. <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/11/alabama-senate-rejects-plan-for-new-swing-congressional-district.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back in November 2021</a>, Alabama’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/committee_proposal_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new congressional map</a> that created six majority-white districts and just one majority-Black district. Civil-rights advocates sued, arguing that Black voters in the state were entitled to a second district under the Voting Rights Act, the landmark law that prohibits racial discrimination in voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 2 of the VRA</a>, it’s illegal to deny members of a racial minority equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice. This has been <a href="http://www.publicmapping.org/what-is-redistricting/redistricting-criteria-the-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely interpreted</a> to mean that, when possible,<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court decisions and congressional guidelines have, over the years, settled on some &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1429826/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fundamental criteria&lt;/a&gt; for determining when this requirement kicks in, such as that a minority group must be large and compact enough to constitute a majority of a district and that voting in the area must be polarized by race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>10</sup></a> states must draw congressional districts where nonwhite voters are the dominant voting bloc, so as to reasonably ensure they can elect their preferred candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> by the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plaintiffs</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a>, it is readily possible to draw two predominantly Black congressional districts in Alabama. For example, in the plaintiffs’ illustrative plan A, the 2nd District’s voting-age population (VAP) is 50.0 percent Black, and the 7th District’s VAP is 50.3 percent Black.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1726" height="892" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">While the VRA explicitly states that racial minorities are not automatically entitled to a number of seats proportional to their share of the population, Black people constitute <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Black%20or%20African%20American&amp;g=0400000US01&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 25 percent</a> of Alabama’s VAP, much larger than the share of congressional districts they predominate in (14 percent). And many Black votes would have been wasted under the overturned map, with the majority-white 1st, 2nd and 3rd districts all having at least a 24 percent Black VAP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, the judges gave the Alabama Legislature until Feb. 11 to draw a new map that “include[s] two districts in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.” But by then, it’s possible that the judges’ decision will have been overturned anyway. Alabama has <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/28/alabama-asks-supreme-court-stay-order-blocking-congressional-map/9260995002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court</a>, arguing that the map should be reinstated because a new one would disrupt preparations for the state’s upcoming primary and improperly prioritize race in redistricting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The high court has yet to signal what it will do with the appeal. But the possibilities run a wide gamut: The case could lead to a very favorable outcome for liberals, a very favorable outcome for conservatives or anything in between.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On one end of the spectrum, the Supreme Court could let the lower court’s ruling stand, which would have the immediate impact of adding a new Black-opportunity congressional seat in Alabama. (In practice, this would also add one Democrat and subtract one Republican from Alabama’s congressional delegation.) It would also have ripple effects throughout the Deep South. If this ruling stands, it could inspire courts to create additional Black-opportunity districts in Louisiana and maybe South Carolina as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Currently, only one of Louisiana’s six congressional districts is predominantly Black, despite the state having one of the country’s largest Black population shares: <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Black%20or%20African%20American&amp;g=0400000US22&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 30 percent</a> of the VAP. With the state’s redistricting process just getting underway this week, Democrats have already proposed <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps</a> that would add a majority-Black seat along the Mississippi River north of Baton Rouge. For example, under Senate Bill 4, the 2nd District would have a VAP that’s 51.5 percent Black and the 5th District would have a VAP that’s 50.5 percent Black.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1714" height="802" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Because Republicans control the Louisiana Legislature (and these maps would eliminate a Republican member of Congress), they may not be inclined to pass any of these maps. But Gov. John Bel Edwards is a Democrat, and he’s already <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-louisiana-legislature-john-bel-edwards-46f6679aafcc1c2c431c78c44c01f503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come out in favor</a> of a second predominantly Black district. Republicans also lack the numbers in the state House to override a potential veto (although they’d only need to convince two independents or conservative Democrats to side with them to do so). That means Louisiana redistricting will probably be decided by the local courts, which would likely follow the Supreme Court’s lead and greenlight a second Black-opportunity district — if that’s what the high court decides to do in Alabama.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, South Carolina has already enacted a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/south-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new congressional map</a> with only one predominantly Black district out of seven, despite the fact that the Palmetto State is <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Black%20or%20African%20American&amp;g=0400000US45&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost one-quarter</a> Black by VAP. However, simple geography may make it harder to convince a court to order a redraw here. While it’s <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::8b0bb8c6-1c6b-4a62-9722-097b7ee1bfd4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible to draw</a> two congressional districts for South Carolina with VAPs that are around 40 percent Black, it’s difficult to draw two <em>majority</em>-Black districts without some <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::3fc53f1f-6f41-450c-b035-86a67d0d3d92" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious contortions</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/83-1968" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court precedent</a>, plaintiffs in a VRA redistricting case must show that the minority group is “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.” (Confusingly, a district doesn’t have to be majority-minority in order to <em>comply</em> with the VRA,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if Black voters constitute a majority of the primary electorate in a heavily Democratic district, that district is likely to elect Black voters’ candidate of choice even if Black voters don’t constitute a majority of the entire electorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> but it has to be possible to draw one in order for a non-majority-minority district to <em>violate</em> it.) South Carolina may not satisfy this test in a court’s eyes — though, in the event of a favorable outcome at the Supreme Court, liberals may very well try their luck just in case.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With or without South Carolina, though, the Supreme Court letting the Alabama ruling stand would be a significant boon to Black representation in Congress — and from a region that has historically suppressed Black voters to boot. It could potentially lead to two, maybe three, new Black members of Congress from the Deep South. As a result, as many as 18 percent of U.S. representatives from states that constituted the former Confederacy could be Black — the most in U.S. history.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming all current Black representatives from the region either win reelection or are replaced with another Black representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Again, though, that’s the best-case scenario for minority representation. Given the conservative ideology of the Supreme Court, the justices could instead overturn the lower court’s ruling and restore Alabama’s 6-1 map. It’s even possible that, in so doing, they will actually weaken the VRA’s protections of minority districts. Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has already <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/effects-shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neutered Section 5 of the act</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-just-made-it-harder-to-fight-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watered down other protections under Section 2</a>; in an extreme scenario, it could reinterpret Section 2 in a way that makes it even easier for states to draw discriminatory maps.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is still a lot of uncertainty about what the court will do, and as we said earlier, the decision could fall anywhere in between the two extremes we’ve laid out in this article. We’ll just have to wait and see; a decision could come down any day now.</p>
