<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-reelection-2024/2021/11/20/0779469c-4947-11ec-95dc-5f2a96e00fa3_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says he’ll run for reelection in 2024</a>. But some Americans don’t believe him  — and moreover, many don’t want him to throw his hat into the ring for a second term. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even before <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden was elected in 2020</a>, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/biden-2024-democrats-search-for-alternative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s been speculation</a> about whether he’ll seek a second term. And a Wall Street Journal poll <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/half-of-americans-doubt-biden-will-run-in-2024-wsj-poll-shows-11647349654" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted from March 2-7</a> found that more than half (52 percent) of registered voters don’t think he’ll run again in 2024, while only 29 percent think he will run again. (Nineteen percent were unsure.) A second Biden run isn’t that popular, either. According to <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/a-year-after-inauguration-biden-faces-a-more-critical-and-pessimistic-public/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an AP/NORC poll</a> conducted from Jan. 13-18, 70 percent of Americans don’t want the president to run in 2024. Even Democrats are lukewarm about the idea. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-2024/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A CNN/SSRS poll</a> conducted from Jan. 10-Feb. 6 found that slightly more than half (51 percent) of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted a candidate other than Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of this might simply reflect that Americans are unenthusiastic about a redux of the 2020 election. In that AP/NORC poll, a similar share (72 percent) said they didn’t want former President Donald Trump to run for reelection either. It’s actually surprisingly common for voters to say they don’t want first-term presidents to seek a second term — to only then turn around and support them when they do run for reelection. However, the share of Americans who don’t want Biden to seek a second term is unusually high compared to previous first-term presidents. It’s also uncommon for voters to think that a sitting president won’t run for reelection. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s no question that concerns about Biden’s age could be playing a role. He’s already the oldest president in U.S. history and will be 81 by the time 2024 rolls around. But some voters might also think it’s time for Biden, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/politics/joe-biden-bridge-new-generation-of-leaders/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who pitched himself as a “bridge”</a> to a new generation of political leaders, to step aside in favor of a candidate who’s not an old, white man.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, though, it’s exceptionally rare for a first-term president to decide not to run for reelection. <a href="https://www.nas.org/blogs/article/ask_a_scholar_declining_the_second_term" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Only six presidents</a> have chosen to bow out after serving one full term. Four of those presidents had actually been in the White House for more than four years because they took over from former presidents who had died in office. The last president to deliberately call it quits after serving for four years was Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That explains why voters tend to (correctly) assume that presidents will run for a second term. At the end of 1982, a midterm year when President Ronald Reagan’s party <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/11/04/on-the-hill-republicans-either-lost-big-or-won-barely/cb12dcb9-b7d8-48ab-bde5-ddb53abf8c8d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost seats in Congress</a>, a majority of Americans nevertheless thought he would run again in 1984. Similarly, a Newsweek poll conducted in December 1994 found that 85 percent of Americans thought President Bill Clinton would run again in 1996, despite his party suffering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/1994-elections-congress-overview-gop-celebrates-its-sweep-power-clinton-vows.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive losses in that year’s midterm elections</a>. A Quinnipiac poll conducted in December 2018 also found that most Americans (81 percent) believed that Trump would run again in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether voters are actually <em>happy</em> about a first-term president running for reelection is an open question, though. A Harris poll conducted in August 1982 found that a majority (56 percent) of Americans thought Reagan shouldn’t run again. In December 1994, slightly more Americans thought Clinton shouldn’t run for reelection (47 percent) than thought he should (44 percent). But it’s not always the case that Americans don’t want a first-term president to run again. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in October 2010 found that more Americans said President Barack Obama should run for reelection (47 percent) than shouldn’t (42 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So in a sense, Biden’s case isn’t <em>that</em> unusual — or even that alarming for his supporters. It’s true that the share of Americans who don’t want him to run for reelection is much higher than it was for Reagan, Clinton or Obama. But unhappiness with a president running again doesn’t tell us much about their ultimate electoral chances if they do try for a second term. Despite voters’ misgivings two years earlier, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/07/politics/reagan-wins-by-a-landslide-sweeping-at-least-48-states-gop-gains.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reagan won by a wide margin in 1984</a>, as did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/us/clinton-elected-2d-term-with-solid-margins-across-us-gop-keeps-hold-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton in 1996</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there are a few reasons to think that Americans might view the prospect of a second Biden run differently than those of previous presidents. In that CNN/SSRS poll from earlier this year, 31 percent of Democrats who wanted the party to nominate someone else said they simply didn’t want Biden to be reelected, 35 percent thought he couldn’t win against the Republicans, and 19 percent said they thought he was too old. That level of skepticism from voters of a president’s own party is pretty abnormal — consider that a Suffolk poll of Republican primary voters conducted in April 2018 found that most (70 percent) wanted Trump to run again. In other words, the fact that so many Democrats have concerns about Biden is perhaps worrying for him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s age has also been a problem for voters that has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/17/joe-biden-doesnt-mind-if-you-think-hes-too-old-take-trump-fellow-septuagenarian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hovered in the background</a> for years. If he’s elected to a second term, he’ll be 86 when he leaves office — nearly a decade older than Reagan, who had previously been America’s oldest president at 77. In 2020, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/perceptions-of-trump-and-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Pew Research Center poll found</a> that 31 percent of registered voters who supported Biden were concerned about his age and health. There’s evidence, too, that Americans generally <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-bidens-opponents-being-too-coy-in-making-age-an-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have reservations</a> about electing a candidate of advanced age. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/01/19/elected-officials-maximum-age-limit-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A YouGov poll conducted in January</a>, for instance, found that 58 percent of Americans support a maximum age limit for elected officials. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also possible that something else is going on: Some Americans might want Biden to step aside in favor of someone else. Perhaps they’d prefer someone who better represents the party’s growing diversity, or someone who is perceived as having a better shot at defeating the Republican nominee in 2024. After all, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval ratings are low</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/01/1095466871/biden-polls-democrats-gen-z-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his support has eroded</a> among <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/democrats-biden-black-voters-midterms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">young voters, Latinos, and Black voters</a> in particular. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-have-been-souring-on-biden-since-last-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Those voters might be dissatisfied</a> with Biden’s inability to deliver on the sweeping promises he made at the beginning of his term. Or they might just be afraid he can’t win.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the economy, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393176/economic-pessimism-growing.aspx">according to a new report from Gallup</a>. In May, Gallup’s economic confidence index — a metric that summarizes how Americans are feeling about the economy on a scale from 100 to -100 — came in at -45, down from -39 in the previous two months. It’s likely the lowest that Americans’ confidence in the economy has been since the Great Recession.</li><li>Just in time for Pride Month, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393197/same-sex-marriage-support-inches-new-high.aspx">a Gallup survey</a> conducted from May 2-22 found that 71 percent of Americans support legal same-sex marriage. That’s not a noticeable change from last year when 70 percent of Americans said they supported same-sex marriage, but Gallup’s trend is a reminder of how much public opinion on this issue has shifted over the past two decades. In 2004, less than half (42 percent) of Americans supported same-sex marriage. And ten years ago, in 2012, support was hovering right around 50 percent.</li><li>Following <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473">the leak of a Supreme Court opinion</a> that suggested five justices may be willing to overturn Roe v. Wade, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/upholding-roe-v-wade-is-supported-by-most-americans-wsj-poll-finds-11654162200">a Wall Street Journal/NORC poll</a> conducted from May 9-17 found that Americans remain firmly opposed to the move. Two-thirds (68 percent) of Americans said they would not like to see the court overturn Roe, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973, while 30 percent said they would like to see that outcome. The poll also found that the share of Americans who say a woman should be able to have an abortion for any reason (57 percent) is at its highest point since NORC began asking the question in 1977.</li><li>Should kids be required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in schools each day? <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/philosophy/survey-results/daily/2022/06/02/d8746/1">A YouGov poll</a> conducted on June 2 found that a majority (52 percent) of Americans think so, while 33 percent say they shouldn’t be required to say the Pledge of Allegiance, and 15 percent said they’re not sure.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">A metal coat hanger can’t speak, but it can send a message. Long a symbol of the dangers faced by people seeking to end pregnancies in the years before Roe v. Wade, coat hangers stand in for a whole inventory of physical horrors, most of which never involved coat hangers, specifically. Over the past few weeks, protesters have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral/people-are-sending-coat-hangers-supreme-court-tiktok-abortion-protest-rcna27195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailed hangers to the Supreme Court</a> in an effort to evoke that past era — from the so-called back-alley butchers who botched surgical procedures and sexually harassed patients, to the terrible lengths individuals went through to give themselves an abortion at home. The message is simple and brutal: Without safe and legal abortion, the protesters believe, people will die. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the years since Roe became the law of the land, the medical landscape of abortion has changed drastically. Today, abortion is extremely safe — <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7009a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safer than birth</a>. So safe, in fact, that it’s not always obvious what made illegal abortions unsafe. Or, for that matter, what the coat hangers were <em>for</em>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this is why those objects still have important stories to tell us, historians told me. Because while the most physically violent abortion methods of the past have become medically obsolete, the march of scientific progress hasn’t eliminated the shame, fear and hopelessness experienced by people who are pregnant, don’t want to be, and live in a society where there is no simple, legal access to abortion. Coat hangers don’t just tell us about the dangers of bad medicine, practiced shoddily, these historians said. Instead, the hangers also speak volumes about the desperation that can lead people to those dangerous procedures in the first place. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">“The whole phrase ‘back-alley butcher’ is an exaggeration because there were lots of good practitioners who were perfectly safe,” said Leslie J. Reagan, professor of history at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and author of “When Abortion Was a Crime.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even in the past, the dangers of illegal abortion weren’t about the abortion itself. No one knows how many illegal abortions were being performed annually, pre-Roe, but researchers in the early 1990s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12317573/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated it was on par with annual numbers of legal abortions at the time</a>, so more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00038049.htm#:~:text=Results%3A%20In%201991%2C%201%2C388%2C937%20abortions,15-44%20years%20of%20age." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 million</a>. People with money and connections could always get safe ones and plenty of people survived, the historians I spoke with said. Illegal abortions were primarily unsafe for the people who were blocked out of better options.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Legal abortions in hospitals, for example, happened with some regularity. These records were kept hospital by hospital, so it’s rare to have even city-wide data, but University of Vermont historian Felicia Kornbluh pointed me towards <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1256364/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 1965 paper that found hospital review boards in New York City had approved 4,703 so-called therapeutic abortions</a> between 1951 and 1962.  In those cases, the technique actually being used was something called a dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C. Also often referred to as a “surgical abortion” the D&amp;C is still used today as a treatment for both abortion and miscarriage. Doctors dilate the cervix — making the opening between the vagina and uterus wider — and use a sharp tool to scrape out the contents of the uterus.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before Roe, in the 1950s and 60s, getting a legal hospital abortion was not easy. A patient could get a D&amp;C if they were already experiencing a natural miscarriage. Otherwise, patients who requested one would have to make a case to their doctors, who would then have to bring the situation before a hospital review board. The patient would likely be examined by other doctors and might have to answer questions — basically, they needed to prove the abortion was medically or psychologically necessary. But necessity wasn’t the only factor at play. “There are studies that show that almost all of them were done on people with private insurance,” Reagan said. Patients without insurance, as well as black and brown patients regardless of insurance status, had a much harder time getting approved. In her upcoming book, “A Woman’s Life is a Human Life,” Kornbluh records that Metropolitan Hospital in East Harlem approved five white women’s requests for every one Black woman’s. The hospital was even less likely to approve Puerto Rican women’s requests. And Reagan has documented instances of Black women being denied abortions even though they had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/pregnancy.html#:~:text=Pregnant%20women%20who%20contract%20rubella,Deafness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rubella infections during pregnancy</a> — something that can kill a fetus, or leave it with lifelong complications, including deafness, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. (Others were lied to and told they didn’t have it.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><br>People who were denied — or who never had a hope of getting — a hospital abortion were left with only illegal options. Both trained doctors and untrained practitioners offered D&amp;C’s, but that procedure was considerably more dangerous in illegal settings. Without sterilized equipment and ready access to antibiotics and painkillers, doctors used furtive practices that optimized for speed and offered no room for follow-up care, and practitioners sometimes had no idea what they were doing. Carole Joffe, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, interviewed trained doctors who practiced illegal abortion during this time and has written about their experiences. One doctor told her that he used to explain the challenges of performing a D&amp;C by telling his residents that it was like being blindfolded and trying to scrape the inside of a wet paper bag without cutting through the paper. Possible, but not easy. “D&amp;C’s in competent hands are safe, but in incompetent hands it’s very easy to perforate the uterus,” Joffe said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To avoid trying to perform the tricky D&amp;C under clandestine circumstances, illegal abortionists sometimes opted instead to simply induce enough of a miscarriage that their patient could go to a hospital and get one without a problem. They did this often by inserting a foreign object — like a hollow tube catheter — through the cervix. In some cases, they might use a type of catheter with a balloon on one end. Filled with saline, it would put pressure on the cervix, like a fetus’s head would towards the end of pregnancy, causing it to fully dilate. Just sticking any catheter in could prompt a miscarriage as the body tried to expel the object. <a href="https://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/Citation/1952/10000/A_CASE_OF_ATTEMPTED_CRIMINAL_ABORTION_WITH.62.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These methods didn’t work all the time</a>, though. They could cause hemorrhages and embolisms. And catheters had to be left in for a while, along with gauze packed into the patient’s vagina to staunch the blood. <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Roe-Report-Part-I-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This could cause infection</a> and with patients trying to hide from authorities, they often didn’t seek treatment until near death.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">People who couldn’t find or afford an illegal abortion often tried to give one to themselves. It’s impossible to say how many of these happened every year, but there are records showing thousands of people coming into emergency rooms with septic infections of the uterus and reproductive organs in the 1960s, Reagan said. This is where the coat hangers come in, Joffe said, as one of many objects people would try to insert through their own cervical openings. The goal was not necessarily to complete an abortion at home but rather to induce enough bleeding and symptoms of miscarriage that the person could go to a hospital, say they were having a miscarriage naturally, and get a hospital D&amp;C. But perforation, hemorrhage, and infection were all risks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even less reliable, and more dangerous, were an array of suppositories, tinctures, herbs and home remedies that plenty of people tried. One doctor told Joffe about treating a patient who had gotten a catheter into her cervix and poured turpentine through it, literally cooking the inside of her uterus, which had to be removed. Others told stories about potassium permanganate tablets, sold over the counter, which people would put in their vaginas to induce bleeding and get their hospital D&amp;C. But the tablets could easily eat through the vaginal lining, causing hemorrhage and destroying the cervix. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s very unlikely that anyone will go back to performing back-alley D&amp;Cs or catheter abortions, Reagan and Joffe said. Even if Roe is overturned, doctors and other people who want to defy it are much more likely to offer patients abortion pills. While <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-can-expect-if-abortion-pills-become-their-only-safe-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion via pill can be a physically painful and psychologically intense experience</a> for some people, the existence of these pills drastically changes the calculus when it comes to the risks of illegal abortion. They’re much easier to get and conceal, much safer to use, and if a patient is worried about side effects they can seek treatment knowing no one will be able to tell the difference between the effects of a pill and a natural miscarriage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But both Reagan and Joffe said the existence of abortion pills won’t eliminate risk if abortion becomes illegal. Just as there were some people who could get abortions more easily than others before Roe, there will be those who can do so after, as well. Meanwhile, some of the most vulnerable people — poor people, people living in very rural areas, people who can’t take time off to drive to another state in search of pills — will still end up with only desperate options left. Reagan was particularly worried that websites selling fake abortion pills will deceive people who have no idea they aren’t getting the real thing. And both she and Joffe worried about how illegality and increased stigma could drive more people towards dangerous at-home methods, with social media becoming the new back alley. Even with abortion still legal, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/23/10656860/coat-hanger-abortion-pregnancy-murder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are occasional instances of people</a> — usually young — trying to abort on their own, Reagan said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The methodology of abortion has improved, Reagan and Joffee told me. But as long as desperation for an abortion exists — and easy access does not — some people will still be in danger. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>The following is an updated version of </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/school-shootings-are-still-rare-and-that-makes-them-hard-to-stop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>this article</em></a><em>, published in 2018.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The horror in Uvalde, Texas, last week was horrifyingly familiar to Mary Ellen O’Toole. Part of a small group of academics, law-enforcement professionals and psychologists who published some of the first research on mass shootings in schools more than 20 years ago, O’Toole knows the patterns these events and perpetrators all follow — and the opportunities for prevention that seem to just keep being missed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I first spoke to her in 2018, after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, but she has been studying school shootings for more than 27 years. In that time, she and other experts say little has changed. The risk factors they identified two decades ago still apply. The recommendations they made are still valid. And every time another batch of Americans die in this way, researchers like O’Toole are forced to watch in horror, thinking about what could have been prevented and why it wasn’t.<br><br>“Honestly, I … I feel very, very angry,” O’Toole said to me last week. There is always another new example of mass gun violence in America. But mass gun violence in America is no longer new — and neither are efforts to stop it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"> “On the news, people are saying we should be concerned about this and that,” O’Toole told me in 2018, “and I thought, ‘We identified that 20 years ago. Did you not read this stuff 20 years ago?’ … It’s fatiguing. I just feel a sense of fatigue.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s difficult to say definitively how many school shootings have happened in this country — different databases count them in different ways and come up with different numbers of incidents. It’s harder still to prove how many would-be shootings were averted, or how many others could have been if additional steps had been taken. But the people who have spent more than two decades trying to understand this phenomenon are still here and are still trying to sell politicians and the public on possible solutions that are complicated, expensive and tough to sum up in a sound bite.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Any research into school shootings is made more difficult by how uncommon such shootings are. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight wrote about the more than <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33,000 people killed by guns in America</a> every year. Of those deaths, roughly one-third — about 12,000 — were homicides, but hardly any were due to mass shootings.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data on total gun deaths and gun homicides was drawn from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and represents the average of the years 2012-2014. There is not a single definition of what constitutes a mass shooting. To count those, we chose to use the definition and database put together by &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt;, because it was recommended by experts I spoke to at the time and because it does a good job of distinguishing between a mass shooting as we understand it in the colloquial/pop-culture sense and other kinds of shootings that, while tragic, don’t fit the narrative we’re trying to focus on here. But there is no one right answer for how to quantify this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you define mass shootings</a> as an event where a lone attacker indiscriminately kills four or more people, in a public place, unrelated gang activity or robbery, then mass shootings account for a tiny portion of all gun homicides — probably a fraction of a percent. School shootings are an even smaller subset</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 1995, when O’Toole began to study school shootings, they seemed like even more of an outlier than they are today. “I couldn’t even call it a phenomenon,” she said in 2018. “Prior to Columbine, there was no indication that it was going to become one of those crimes that just becomes part of the culture. It looked like it could have faded away.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These uncommon but high-profile tragedies had also drawn the attention of Marisa Randazzo. In 1999, she was the chief psychologist for the Secret Service and became a part of a joint effort between the Secret Service and Department of Education to better understand school shooters and how to prevent attacks before they happened. Randazzo had previously worked on <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Photocopy/167224NCJRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Exceptional Case Study Project</a> — a Secret Service project designed to better understand people who threaten the president and other public figures. Like school shootings, assassinations are extremely rare events that have a huge impact on society. That rarity makes them hard to study — and makes it hard to tell blowhards from real threats. But their impact makes them important to understand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Randazzo found that the project’s findings echoed what she was learning about school shootings. For instance, the Secret Service had once focused its energy on threats made by people with a history of violent crime or who had a mental illness that caused them to act irrationally. But the Exceptional Case Study Project analysis showed that most people who actually carry out attacks didn’t meet either of those criteria. Instead, a better way to figure out who was really a threat was to talk to friends, family and coworkers — most attackers had discussed their plans with other people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Randazzo</a>’s and <a href="http://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/safety/fbi-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O’Toole’s</a> parallel reports came to remarkably similar conclusions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, these studies determined that there wasn’t much point in trying to profile school shooters. Yes, most were (and remain) male and white, but those categories were so broad that they’re essentially useless in identifying potential threats ahead of time, Randazzo said. What’s more, she said, more detailed profiles risked stigmatizing perfectly reasonable behaviors — like wearing black and listening to loud music.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, the reports focused on the behavior and mental state of the young people who chose to kill. While these teens were deeply troubled, that’s not quite the same thing as saying that those who commit school shootings are just irredeemably mentally ill. Nor does it mean those young people suddenly snapped, giving no warning. “School shooters typically do this out of a profound adolescent crisis,” said James Garbarino, a professor of psychology at Loyola University Chicago who specializes in teen violence and began studying school shooters in the late 1990s.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Randazzo described a pattern of young people who were deeply depressed, unable to cope with their lives, who saw no other way out of a bad situation. The stressors they faced wouldn’t necessarily be problems that an adult would see as especially traumatic, but these young people were unable to handle their emotions, sadness and anger, and they started acting in ways that were, essentially, suicidal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of the best data on the mental state of school shooters has come from interviews with those shooters (and would-be shooters) who survived the attack. Randazzo described one such living school shooter,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randazzo declined to say who she was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> currently serving multiple life sentences, who told her that before the attack he spent weeks vacillating between suicide and homicide. Only after he tried and failed to kill himself did he settle on killing others in hopes that someone would kill him. Garbarino, who has interviewed dozens of people who went to prison for life as teenagers, both for school shootings and other violent crimes, heard many similar stories.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The reason I emphasize this is that we know so much about how to help someone who is suicidal, and those same resources can be used very effectively with someone who is planning to engage in school violence,” Randazzo said. So how do we spot the ones who are planning an attack at a school? The studies she and O’Toole published years ago showed that, like people planning to attack the president, would-be school shooters don’t keep their plans to themselves. They tell friends or even teachers that they want to kill. They talk about their anger and their suicidality. They lash out violently against family and friends. And as more teens have attacked their schoolmates, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-florida-shooting-research-20180216-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that pattern has proved to hold true over time</a>. It was true for Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland shooter. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-yorks-red-flag-law-helped-thwart-buffalo-mass-shooting-went-wrong-rcna29054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It was true for Payton Gendron</a>, the Buffalo shooter. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/28/uvalde-texas-gunman-online-threats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It was true for Salvador Ramos</a>, the Robb Elementary shooter. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While all the experts I spoke with said that policies that keep guns out of the hands of teenagers are an important part of preventing mass shootings, they all also said it is crucial to set up systems that spot teens who are struggling and may become dangerous. You can’t predict violent events or who will go from threatening behavior to murder, O’Toole said. But it is possible for us to look around and see the people who are having problems and need intervention. Interventions can prevent violence, even if we can’t predict it, she told me. For example, at least four potential school shootings that were averted in the weeks after Parkland all stopped because the would-be killers spoke or wrote about their plans and someone told law enforcement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And there’s usually time to spot these things coming. While homicides in general are almost never premeditated, mass shootings — including school shootings — almost always are, said Adam Lankford, a professor of criminology at the University of Alabama. That makes sense, O’Toole said, because it takes time for a person who is drowning in self-pity and anger to decide their misery is someone else’s fault, to dehumanize those other people to the point of being able to kill them and to isolate themselves from any reality checks that could break through these dangerous thought patterns.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But time also erodes the systems that schools have implemented in the past to prevent violence. Randazzo told me that her team had trained numerous school districts in school shooting prevention back in the early 2000s and that, as of 2018, many of those districts no longer had prevention systems in place. Thanks to staff turnover and budget reprioritization, such institutional knowledge simply withered away. And ironically, that happens precisely <em>because</em> school shootings are so rare. “It takes time and effort for a school to create a team and get training,” Randazzo said. “And, fortunately, threatening behavior doesn’t happen often enough” to spur schools to action.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ views on abortion have been <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively consistent</a> for years despite massive demographic changes, social upheaval and shifting perspectives on sexuality. But that may be about to change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A new <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americans-views-on-whether-and-in-what-circumstances-abortion-should-be-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from the Pew Research Center</a> found that support for abortion rights is considerably higher among young Americans. Roughly three-quarters of 18- to 29-year-olds say abortion should generally be legal, including 30 percent who say it should be legal in all cases. Meanwhile, Americans 65 and older expressed much more tepid support — only 54 percent said abortion should be legal without exception (14 percent) or with some exceptions (40 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This might not sound all that surprising since younger adults often <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/26/key-findings-how-americans-attitudes-about-climate-change-differ-by-generation-party-and-other-factors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see issues</a> differently from older adults, but this age gap on attitudes about abortion contradicts past polling on this issue. According to the <a href="http://www3.norc.org/GSS+Website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Social Survey</a>,<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GSS is conducted by the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, with funding from the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> young Americans’ views on obtaining an abortion have not been appreciably different from the public’s overall for much of the past 40-plus years. That changed fairly recently, though. On the question of whether someone should be able to get an abortion for any reason, 64 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds agreed in 2021, a 20-percentage-point increase from a decade earlier.</p>

When we refer to “young Americans” or “young adults” as those ages 18 to 29, we will specify that, as 26- to 29-year-olds are technically millennials per Pew’s definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a> — who are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/millennials-are-leaving-religion-and-not-coming-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less religious</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/02/14/millennial-life-how-young-adulthood-today-compares-with-prior-generations-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more educated</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/the-liberal-millennial-revolution/470826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal</a> than previous generations — are not stronger supporters of abortion rights. <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls</a> have generally shown that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/01/4-race-immigration-same-sex-marriage-abortion-global-warming-gun-policy-marijuana-legalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millennials</a> express considerable <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/07/01/137079714/poll-generation-y-supports-gay-marriage-but-is-divided-on-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambivalence about abortion</a>, views that do not distinguish them from the broader public. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Millennials’ attitudes on abortion rights stand in stark relief to the way they tend to approach other issues of sex and sexuality. For instance, they were among the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2013/03/20/growing-support-for-gay-marriage-changed-minds-and-changing-demographics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest proponents</a> of legalizing same-sex marriage at the height of debate in the mid-2000s, and they have generally liberal views on <a href="https://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PRRI-Millennials-Web-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contraception, sex education</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25940736/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">premarital sex</a>. Abortion has always been the exception.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of focus groups</a> that my colleagues and I conducted in 2011,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted four focus groups among 36 politically moderate white 18- to 29-year-olds in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, area. Groups were separated by gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> the contrast between millennials’ attitudes on abortion and same-sex marriage was clear. When they were asked to write down the first words that came to mind when they heard the term “same-sex marriage,” millennials’ responses were overwhelmingly positive — even celebratory. “Awesome,” “It’s cool!” and “Go for it!” were some of the phrases they shared, and the ensuing conversation was incredibly upbeat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The mood was dramatically different when discussing abortion, though. It was often difficult to get participants to maintain eye contact during the conversation, and their responses were largely negative: They said abortion was a sad situation and mentioned death or irresponsible behavior.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Scholars proposed a variety of theories to explain millennials’ curiously conservative views. It was suggested, for example, that the rise in sharing ultrasound images on social media may have led more young adults to think of a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/pro-life-pro-science/549308/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fetus as a growing child</a>, thus accounting for their greater reservations about abortions. Another popular explanation was that millennials were influenced by how abortion was <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Understanding_Public_Opinion/r_jd0nzKTvMC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=millennials+abortion+Juno+popular+culture&amp;pg=PT212&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrayed in popular culture</a> at the time, including in movies such as 2007’s “Juno” and “Knocked Up.” Demographic explanations have also featured prominently, as Latinos, who tend to be <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latino-millennials-are-more-conservative-abortion-n330921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more conservative</a> on abortion than other racial or ethnic groups, constitute a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-jan_brookings-metro_millennials-a-demographic-bridge-to-americas-diverse-future.pdf#page=6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger share</a> of millennials compared with older generations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, though, we’re left to solve another riddle: Why do Generation Z adults (born between 1997 and 2004) not share millennials’ more conservative perspectives on abortion? There are a few possible explanations worth considering.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps the simplest is that Gen Z adults, particularly women, are <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/featured_data/the-growing-political-divide-between-young-men-and-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal than previous generations</a> when they were young adults — including millennials. While younger adults are typically more liberal than older ones, Gen Z women especially tend to be progressive. An <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/march-2022-aps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis of Gallup surveys over the past decade</a> conducted by the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life, which I lead, found a critical shift in political identity among young women. In 2021, we found that 44 percent of 18- to 29-year-old women <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/featured_data/the-growing-political-divide-between-young-men-and-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified as liberal</a>, whereas only 30 percent of 18- to 29-year-old women identified as such a decade earlier. Among men in this age group, the share who identified as liberal was essentially unchanged during the same time period.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another explanation is that for most Gen Z Americans, abortion is not an issue wound up in ethical, moral and religious concerns, as it more often is for many other Americans. Pew’s March survey suggests that most Gen Z Americans aren’t thinking about abortion with the same moral framing: Only 32 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said abortion was morally wrong in all or most cases compared with 47 percent of 30- to 49-year-olds and 53 percent of Americans age 50 or older. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that growing diversity among Gen Zers along lines of race, religion and, most notably, sexuality has also led them to eschew the standards of morality that previous generations embrace. It’s true that millennials are also a fairly diverse group, but Gen Zers are unique in their approach to sexuality and feelings of physical attraction. For instance, a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/gender-identity-and-sexual-orientation-differences-generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 Ipsos survey</a> found that Gen Zers are significantly less likely than millennials to be attracted exclusively to the opposite sex. And compared with older generations, Gen Zers (as well as millennials) are more likely to agree that greater <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial and ethnic diversity is good for society</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The waning influence of organized religion may offer another clue as to why Gen Z supports abortion rights more than other generations. According to the Survey Center on American Life, Gen Zers had somewhat <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/generation-z-future-of-faith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weaker formative attachments</a> to religion than millennials did. Fifteen percent of Gen Zers said they were raised in nonreligious households, and even those raised in a religious tradition reported having less regular involvement with their faith. As a result, it’s likely that compared with older generations, Gen Zers are just less familiar with religiously based objections to abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s important to remember, too, that Gen Zers are coming of age at a time when America’s religious identity and moral authority are more contested and its institutions less trusted. Consider, for example, how much confidence in organized religion has plummeted in the past decade. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Gallup</a>, only 37 percent of Americans said they had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the church or organized religion in 2021. But in the mid-2000s, when millennials were roughly the same age as Gen Zers are now, a greater share of Americans expressed confidence in religious institutions. In other words, not only are Gen Zers less rooted in religious communities, but religiously based arguments about abortion may hold less weight for them than they did for millennials because those in Gen Z do not trust the messengers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young adults today are also being told that the pathway to happiness and success lies in getting a good education and career. In fact, growing up, Gen Zers were more likely than previous generations to say it was <a href="https://storylines.substack.com/p/in-seeking-to-stand-out-gen-z-has?s=w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected that they would go to college</a>. Sixty percent of Gen Zers said their parents expected them to attend a four-year college compared with 48 percent of millennials, 43 percent of Gen Xers and 35 percent of baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recently, I wrote that Gen Zers are distinct from previous generations in their belief that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-most-accomplished-loneliest-generation-blame-parents-fault-2022-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional and educational achievements are critical</a> markers of their identity. Given the central importance of education, personal growth and fulfillment for this generation, it’s possible that support for abortion rights is rooted in the idea that an unplanned pregnancy might undermine these aspirations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, a crucial difference between Gen Z and millennials on abortion rights may have to do with shifting perceptions of access. Millennials came of age at a time when abortion was perceived as generally available and subject to comparatively few restrictions. In a <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2011 survey</a>, a majority (55 percent) of millennials said it was not at all or not too difficult to get an abortion, a significantly higher share compared with other age groups’ responses. After <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/states-arent-waiting-for-the-supreme-court-to-rule-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a decade of state-level restrictions</a>, though, and well-publicized efforts to reduce abortion access, views have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-may-be-mobilizing-more-democratic-voters-than-republicans-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed significantly</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, research has long shown that younger Americans are generally <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-younger-americans-dont-vote-more-often-no-its-not-apathy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less engaged</a> in politics and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/04/26/10-political-engagement-knowledge-and-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend less time</a> talking about political issues than older Americans. But abortion may be an issue they care about more. According to results from Pew’s March survey, younger Americans spend as much time as Americans overall thinking about abortion, and for young women, the share is even higher. If the Supreme Court does overturn Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973, it is not difficult to believe that the large majority of Gen Zers who support abortion rights will see such a move as an infringement on rights once afforded to them. And if the past few years have shown us anything, it is that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/white-working-class-trump-cultural-anxiety/525771/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety is a powerful political motivator</a>.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The idea that the Democratic Party is in over its head has been such a common narrative in the political media that the refrain “Dems in disarray” is now something of an online joke. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew debates whether the party, as it struggles to pass federal legislation and faces a difficult midterm year, really is in disarray or whether these hurdles are usual for any party in power.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The team also discusses public opinion on gun laws after the recent mass shootings in Texas, New York and California and explores why seemingly sizable support for stricter gun regulations hasn’t produced new laws.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Giving birth in the U.S. is <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/nov/maternal-mortality-maternity-care-us-compared-10-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already far more dangerous</a> than in other wealthy countries. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ending the protections of Roe v. Wade</a> — the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion — could make it even more so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Multiple studies have found that the states that already have the tightest restrictions on abortion also have the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality. And that correlation stubbornly persists even after researchers account for some of the other differences between states, like racial demographics and health care policy. Some researchers think that abortion restrictions are part of the reason why pregnancy and childbirth are so much more dangerous in the U.S. — even for people who never wanted an abortion to begin with. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This data could just be a statistical red herring. But there are ways abortion restrictions could kill people, both directly and indirectly. And scientists say these correlations point toward dangerous disparities in health care access in the U.S. — not just in terms of who can get an abortion, but also in terms of who can get preventative care while pregnant, or even before.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><hr><span></span></div>
 



<h2><strong>The U.S. is a uniquely dangerous place to have a child</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Carrying an unplanned pregnancy involves shouldering <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20454434.pdf?casa_token=JanK2hv1ZygAAAAA:OlJRa980BLaCg5Xg2Xqoqi4qWYCczLlhzI971LfW0zVP_El6gLvNHiIMlfrDrGMOUbuW-ZR1f5Ed51bMSVjXqAOdc_BAHWKJA5pPXO7G6Gg4R7my6hYv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased risks</a> of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00737-022-01225-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a>, preterm birth, lower birth weight and other complications. That was definitely true for Brittany Mostiller. In the summer of 2006, this Chicago mom of two young children found herself pregnant, and every circumstance in her life felt like it was conspiring to make raising a third child impossible. Mostiller had recently lost her job and was sharing a two-bedroom apartment with her sister and niece. She was overwhelmed and wanted an abortion, but the cost of the procedure put it out of reach. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So she stayed pregnant. And as the pregnancy progressed, she became more and more unhappy. “I was just severely depressed, and I wasn’t caring for myself,” she said. Her body seemed to rebel against her; she was fending off infection after infection, she said. And then her water broke when she was 32 weeks pregnant — two months before the baby was supposed to be born.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mostiller’s story illustrates how easily a pregnancy you didn’t plan for can go awry. She and her baby — now a healthy teenager — came out of the experience okay. But not everyone does. Unplanned pregnancies are already <a href="http://hillkm.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/moaddab_et_al_2018_health_care_disparity_and_pregnancy_related_mortality_in_the_united_states_2005_2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to end in the death of the mother</a>. But the truth is that<em> </em><em>all </em>pregnancies are more dangerous in the U.S. than they are in comparable countries, and those dangers are particularly acute for Black people, like Mostiller. </p>

(The maternal mortality rate calculated by the CDC includes deaths from abortion-related complications, but the organization also calculates that subset separately. In 2019, the death rate from abortion in the United States was minuscule: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7009a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0.41 deaths per 100,000 legal abortions between 2013 and 2018</a>.) Infants are also at higher risk of dying in the U.S. than in other wealthy countries. In 2020, the infant mortality rate in the U.S. was <a href="https://childmortality.org/data/United%20States%20of%20America" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.4 deaths per 1,000 live births</a>, compared with <a href="https://childmortality.org/data/Finland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in Finland</a> and <a href="https://childmortality.org/data/spain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.7 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in Spain</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Black Americans are nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three times more likely</a> than their white counterparts to die as a result of maternal complications, and the risk to Black babies is <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much higher as well</a>. These disparities are so large that the states with the highest maternal mortality rates are also often states with large Black populations, and researchers have concluded that social factors like <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from-dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inequality</a> and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-hospitals-are-failing-black-mothers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structural racism</a> are playing a huge role in why pregnancy complications kill Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some researchers think that attempts to restrict abortion access are playing a part too. <a href="https://sph.tulane.edu/news/study-finds-higher-maternal-mortality-rates-states-more-abortion-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a 2021 study</a>, Tulane University researchers categorized states based on the presence or absence of specific types of abortion restrictions and found that total maternal mortality was 51 percent higher in states where only licensed physicians are permitted to perform abortions, and total maternal mortality was 29 percent higher in states with Medicaid restrictions on abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010782421000901#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another set of researchers</a> looked at changes in maternal mortality from 1995 to 2017, and similar to the others, they found that states with abortion restrictions had higher rates of maternal mortality than states that were either neutral toward abortion or protected abortion rights. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1240239810-711.jpg" alt="A woman stands at the check-in window of the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, Louisiana" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1240239810-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1240239810-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1240239810-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Overturning Roe v. Wade will lead to the closure of many abortion clinics across the country. Fewer clinics and less abortion access may, in turn, lead to higher maternal mortality rates in the U.S. <p>FRANCOIS PICARD / AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7312072/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A third study found</a> that infants living in states with more abortion restrictions were more likely to die — which wasn’t really surprising, given the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30389101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close link</a> between the health of mothers and infants.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, a pattern is not an explanation. It’s impossible to demonstrate conclusively that tightening abortion restrictions causes an increase in maternal or infant deaths, researchers told us. That’s because the way science establishes causality is through experiments that simply can’t happen in real life. “That would be the gold standard of a randomized, controlled trial,” said <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/ssw/faculty/faculty-directory/summe-sherburne-hawkins.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Hawkins</a>, a professor of social epidemiology at Boston College. “You’d randomize states to implement certain policies or to close Planned Parenthood clinics … and of course that’s never going to happen.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And there are plenty of reasons why maternal mortality might be higher in those states that aren’t specifically connected to abortion policy. For one thing, many states with strong abortion restrictions <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/public-health-paradox-states-abortion-laws-maternal-child-health-outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t expand Medicaid</a>, which experts told us can lead to generally worse health outcomes because many direct causes of maternal mortality <a href="https://ihpi.umich.edu/news/increasing-rates-chronic-conditions-putting-more-moms-babies-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin as long-term chronic health problems</a> that go untreated or undiagnosed for years. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-04-07/social-programs-weak-in-many-states-with-tough-abortion-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poverty is also high</a> in many of those states, which experts said can have a similar impact. <a href="https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/departments/academic-departments/obstetrics-and-gynecology/obgyn-faculty/stacie-geller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stacie Geller</a>, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Illinois College of Medicine who studies maternal death, pointed out that health care providers can address only some of the factors that lead to maternal mortality — and their ability to help is often limited to pregnancy. “​​You can’t take a woman with a lifetime of poor health, poor social surroundings, and get her healthy in nine months of pregnancy,” she said. “It’s just not possible.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But researchers have accounted for some of those differences in their studies — and the associations between abortion restriction and maternal mortality remain. Hawkins’s research, for example, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379719304192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistically controlled for whether states expanded Medicaid</a>. The study found that reducing Planned Parenthood clinics by 20 percent was associated with a maternal mortality increase of 8 percent, while states that implemented abortion restrictions based on gestational age saw a 38 percent increase in maternal mortality. Likewise, the study that tracked changes in maternal mortality across states between 1995 and 2017 got around the problem of distinguishing correlation from causation by focusing on changes in maternal mortality that happened after restrictive abortion policies were implemented. During that same time period, obesity and poverty rates didn’t change significantly, said <a href="https://surgery.wustl.edu/people/mark-hoofnagle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Hoofnagle</a>, a surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis and a co-author of the study. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, you end up with a collection of evidence that points toward the conclusion that abortion restrictions and maternal mortality are somehow linked. And that makes sense because we already knew that social forces could affect maternal mortality. But what’s behind that link — specifically, <em>how</em> abortion restrictions could cause more women to die — is harder to pin down. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<h2><strong>How could abortion restrictions lead to higher maternal mortality?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sociology/our-people/amanda-stevenson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda Stevenson</a>, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder, <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/58/6/2019/265968/The-Pregnancy-Related-Mortality-Impact-of-a-Total" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> late last year that a total ban on abortion would result in a 7 percent increase in pregnancy-related deaths in first year of the ban and a 21 percent increase in pregnancy-related deaths in the years that followed. Those estimates are probably high, she told us, because overturning Roe wouldn’t result in a nationwide ban — but she thinks more maternal deaths are still likely to occur. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But supporters of abortion restrictions frame the laws as life-<em>saving</em> measures. Monique Wubbenhorst, a senior researcher and policy fellow at Notre Dame University’s de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture who is anti-abortion, said she saw no clear mechanism for how diminished access to abortion could cause an increase in deaths. Instead, she suspected that the correlations were statistical ghosts — perhaps hinting at some third factor connected to both. That’s certainly a possibility. Maternal deaths, despite being more common in the U.S. than in other wealthy nations, are still very rare. And that small sample size means that researchers who try to draw broader conclusions using the data can run into problems — it’s hard to look at what’s going on within demographic subgroups, for instance, or examine what’s happening within specific states. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other researchers do see potential mechanisms, though. The simplest explanation is just that giving birth is statistically more dangerous than having an abortion. If the states with the highest mortality rates are the also the ones banning abortion that means more births — and also more deaths.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-849031566-711.jpg" alt="Demonstrators hold signs in memory of Savita Halappanavar at a vigil in Dublin" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-849031566-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-849031566-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-849031566-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>In 2012, doctors in Ireland refused an abortion to Savita Halappanavar, and she developed an infection that killed her. The case ultimately led to the repeal of many abortion restrictions in Ireland. <p>Julien Behal / PA Images via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Deaths could also increase because doctors in states that ban abortion may be unsure about when they can legally end a pregnancy in a person who is miscarrying. For example, in 2012, doctors in Ireland refused an abortion to Savita Halappanavar <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because the baby she was miscarrying still had a fetal heartbeat</a>. In the time it took for cardiac activity in the fetus to stop — and the doctors to then be confident an abortion would conform with the country’s laws — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/27/world/europe/savita-halappanavar-ireland-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halappanavar developed the infection</a> that killed her. The case ultimately led to the repeal of many abortion restrictions in Ireland.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a similar way, abortion restrictions could lead to more infants dying in birth or immediately afterward, said <a href="https://sph.tulane.edu/sbps/maeve-wallace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maeve Wallace</a>, a professor of reproductive epidemiology at Tulane University. She is part of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379721003536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a team that found</a> a correlation between the implementation of gestational age restrictions on abortion and an increase in infant mortality due to congenital abnormalities. During a pregnancy, doctors run tests to spot such abnormalities, but some tests can’t be performed until <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=90&amp;contentid=P08956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the middle of the second trimester</a>, which is very close to when abortion <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/abortion-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becomes illegal in some restrictive states</a>. “You’re getting these test results and you’re beyond your gestational age limit to abort this fetus that might not even live an hour outside the womb because of some severe anomaly,” Wallace said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the connection between abortion restrictions and death could also be more complicated than these examples — tied to how additional support for mothers and families isn’t usually addressed in step with the passage of new restrictions. In fact, efforts to reduce abortion access have often resulted in the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/01/28/464728393/texas-tries-to-repair-damage-wrought-upon-family-planning-clinics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure of clinics</a> like Planned Parenthood that offer a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/nearly-900-women-s-health-clinics-have-lost-federal-funding-n1069591" target="_blank" rel="noopener">range of non-abortion-related services</a>. Losing access to preventative health care puts people at a higher risk for all kinds of illnesses that can later cause pregnancy complications. And this effect means the impacts of abortion restriction can overlap and build on the social inequalities that are already harming Black people and babies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, states like Georgia and Louisiana, which have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/19/why-louisianas-maternal-mortality-rates-are-so-high-00033832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently high rates</a> of <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/USPA-MHRI-GA-FS-Final-ForPrint-Pages.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal mortality,</a> also have disproportionately high numbers of those deaths happening in Black people. The deaths often come from conditions like <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/maternal-deaths-caused-chronic-hypertension-continue-rise#:~:text=Chronic%20hypertension%20is%20contributing%20substantially,a%20result%20of%20the%20condition." target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronic hypertension</a>, <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313276#:~:text=With%20the%20greatest%20morbidity%20and,fetal%20deaths%20worldwide%20every%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener">preeclampsia</a> and <a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/275038-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemorrhage</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Black Americans have a harder time accessing health care that could prevent or treat those conditions, and they have a harder time getting proper treatment even when they can access it. “​​Just in my own social circles and network, I can throw a rock and hit somebody who also had a traumatic birth experience, who also experienced a loss or a morbidity,” said Nakeenya Wilson, a community advocate on the Texas’s <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dshs.texas.gov%2Fmch%2FMaternal-Mortality-and-Morbidity-Review-Committee.aspx&amp;data=05%7C01%7CAmelia.Thomson-DeVeaux%40abc.com%7Cd00b1f1f3c6d4ae3874608da38269047%7C56b731a8a2ac4c32bf6b616810e913c6%7C1%7C0%7C637884035638587377%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=3KWmyoTFtjK2DQbgcXlsR5nFChEK3UbupFU8Cr5G%2BEU%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Black people, and especially those who have low incomes and live in rural areas, have precious little access to health care before, during or after they become pregnant, said <a href="https://morehousehealthcare.com/physicians/obgyn/sutton-madeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Madeline Sutton</a>, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Morehouse College whose work focuses on health care inequalities for women. When people go without checkups and prenatal care because they can’t afford it, can’t take time off work or live hours from the nearest clinic, their risks go up. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1157020324-711.jpg" alt="Boxes of exam gloves hang on the wall next to a picture of Maya Angelou in an examination room at Whole Woman's Health" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1157020324-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1157020324-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1157020324-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Black people, and especially those who have low incomes and live in rural areas, have a harder time getting quality health care before, during and after they become pregnant. <p>Scott Olson / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Abortion restrictions aren’t the only thing making it hard for pregnant people in states like Georgia to get preventative care — hospital closures in rural areas have been a huge factor, Sutton said — but reducing access to clinics like Planned Parenthood is just pulling one more brick out of an a wall that was already listing. What’s more, while anti-abortion Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana has co-sponsored federal bills aimed at studying racial disparities in health care and promoting remote monitoring of pregnant Medicaid patients’ blood pressure and other health metrics, state legislatures that remove the supports offered by abortion clinics have not generally made an effort to shore up the wall in other ways. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s almost like the abortion hostility is a signal for a general hostility towards interventions on women’s health and prenatal care,” Hoofnagle said. All the states in his study of maternal mortality had similarly low rates of maternal mortality in the 1990s. And all saw an increase in deaths over the next 20 years because the way maternal mortality is measured improved during that time, he said. But some states chose to put a legislative priority on preventing future deaths. California, for example, took steps to standardize blood-transfusion protocols statewide, ensuring that even small hospitals would have skills and tools to deal with hemorrhage in childbirth, and that obstetricians were following the latest, evidence-based guidelines for how transfusions should be done. The efforts <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937817301242" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced severe maternal morbidity in patients with hemorrhages</a> by nearly 29 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of the experts we spoke with believe maternal mortality rates are a huge problem, and each stressed the need to improve maternal health care. Part of the challenge, though, is that abortion is such a fraught issue and it’s hard to get people on the same page about what the data is saying. Researchers who are very concerned about threats to abortion rights will probably be more inclined to see a connection between abortion restrictions and maternal deaths than researchers who oppose abortion rights, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-1392/185351/20210729163513970_19-1392%20Amicus%20Brief%20in%20Support%20of%20Petitioners.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Wubbenhorst</a>. She, for instance, questioned whether legislators were best suited to help reduce maternal deaths, as opposed to hospitals. Meanwhile, other experts, like Geller, expressed anger that anti-abortion lawmakers were focusing so much on restrictions and so little on the pregnancies that the restrictions would cause. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most experts we spoke with, though, said there needs to be more attention on the health of women who want abortions and won’t be able to get them. Wilson, the maternal-health advocate in Texas, said that she tries to stay out of the abortion debate in general, but she’s worried that, as lawmakers race to ban abortion, those women and their babies are being left out of the conversation. “​​No [woman] should ever have to face death in order to bring life into this world,” Wilson said. “If, in fact, we’ve taken the position as a country, as a state, that we are going to protect the unborn baby, where is the pipeline and the follow-through … to ensure that that child and family unit has the resources that they need in order to not just survive, but to thrive?”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">America’s racial wealth gap is well-documented, even if many <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-many-americans-dont-see-the-racial-wealth-gap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue to underestimate its existence</a>. Black Americans’ net worth is, on average, less <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than 15 percent of white Americans’</a>, the legacy of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-barack-obama-failed-black-americans/511358/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centuries of systemic anti-Black racism</a>. Moreover, both political parties have failed time and again to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-catch-22-facing-black-voters-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">address the inequities facing Black Americans</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what if I told you that an effective way to start closing this gap was within reach? According to the scholars I talked with who study this issue, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/student-debt-forgiveness-debate-highlights-racial-gap-in-what-borrowers-owe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceling student debt</a> is one of the best ways to start to close America’s racial wealth gap, and although it has its risks, it’s something that President Biden can do on his own <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/politics/student-loan-debt-joe-biden/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by executive order</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Higher education was supposed to be the engine for some to secure financial security and stability,” said <a href="https://publicpolicy.unc.edu/people/fenaba-r-addo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fenaba Addo</a>, a professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who has researched the links between debt and wealth inequality. But she told me that just hasn’t happened. “The realized gains have not been distributed equally, and student debt has contributed to that,” said Addo.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, the typical graduating college student <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-student-loan-debt-by-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">owes about $30,000 in student debt</a>, about four times more than they did 50 years ago. But that topline figure masks some real racial disparities. Consider that because Black students tend to come from poorer households than their white counterparts, they are more likely to take out loans — and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/student-loans-the-racial-wealth-divide-and-why-we-need-full-student-debt-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take out larger loans</a>. Moreover, even white students who end up borrowing money for college <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2017/02/15/family-achievements-how-a-college-degree-accumulates-wealth-for-whites-and-not-for-blacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have, on average, more preexisting family wealth</a> at their disposal to pay down their debts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, student debt exacerbates the racial wealth gap, starting from the moment that newly christened graduates toss their caps in the air.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, this doesn’t even count the people who don’t finish college and are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/millions-of-student-loan-borrowers-dont-have-a-diploma-to-show-for-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;still saddled with student debt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">And the further removed from college young Americans become, the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/es_20161020_scott-clayton_evidence_speaks.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more this disparity grows</a> — more than triple, according to a 2016 report from the Brookings Institution — sapping Black Americans’ net worth even more. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2332649218790989" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 paper</a> from Addo and sociologist Jason Houle found, for example, that if younger Black adults held the same level of debt as their white peers, the racial wealth gap in young adulthood would be reduced by about 10 percent. Addo and Houle also found that student debt’s contribution to the racial wealth gap increased with age, from 13 percent at 25 to 23 percent at 30. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Crucially, too, the racial gap in student debt levels has only grown in recent years. A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Louise-Seamster/publication/315114639_Predatory_Inclusion_and_Education_Debt_Rethinking_the_Racial_Wealth_Gap/links/5bb5e20d45851574f7f86341/Predatory-Inclusion-and-Education-Debt-Rethinking-the-Racial-Wealth-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 paper</a> found that the average student debt for Black households — and number of Black households holding any student debt — increased significantly from 2001 to 2013. The authors found, further, that this growing divide was not because of more Black Americans attending college, but due to disproportionate exploitation by predatory lenders. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/sociology/people/louise-seamster" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louise Seamster</a>, a professor of sociology, criminology and African American studies at the University of Iowa and a co-author of the paper, said the fact that Black students tend to carry far more student debt contradicts the idea that higher education is a means to mobility. “If the racial wealth gap between Black and white Americans is 10-to-1, at the median for all families, when we just look at the racial wealth gap between Black and white borrowers, it’s actually twice as bad,” Seamster said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the context in which canceling student debt has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/15/biden-student-loan-forgive-cancel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered the political discourse</a>. Progressive Democrats have made the case that forgiving student loans would ease the burden <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-schumer-jayapal-pressley-omar-porter-urge-president-biden-to-deliver-on-promise-to-cancel-student-debt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on millions of families</a>, while <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/05/05/senators-argue-over-who-benefits-from-student-debt-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans</a> (and some Democrats) have argued that it would disproportionately <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loans-biden-college-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefit the wealthiest Americans</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the scholars I spoke to pushed back against the idea that canceling student debt would be regressive. <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/charlie-eaton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Eaton</a>, a professor of economic sociology at the University of California, Merced, said that such analyses often look at income, not wealth, and discount racial disparities in borrowing and the fact that many college students attend college without borrowing money to begin with.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eaton’s <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RI_StudentDebtCancellation_IssueBrief_202106.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own research</a> has found that canceling $50,000 of student debt — as some Democratic senators have proposed — would not benefit the wealthiest Americans. Such a cancelation, Eaton and his co-authors found, would disproportionately benefit poorer Black households — while giving little relief to those at the top of the wealth distribution:<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat paradoxically, forgiving $50,000 of student debt would also strongly benefit the highest-earning&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Black Americans. But according to Addo that’s in large part because even higher-income Black households tend to hold relatively little household wealth — and thus finance college through taking out loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> </p>

Biden has said, for instance, that he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/biden-says-hes-not-considering-50000-in-student-loan-forgiveness-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t consider canceling $50,000</a> and has recently indicated that $10,000 will be forgiven. But canceling $10,000 wouldn’t do much to help, according to <a href="https://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/faculty/faculty_profile.jsp?faculty=593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Aja</a>, a professor of Puerto Rican and Latino studies at Brooklyn College, because of the racialization of student debt.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Twenty years into repayment, the median black borrowers owe 95 percent of what they borrowed, while the median white person has almost fully repaid their loan,” Aja said. “So if you throw $10,000 cancellation into that figure, it’s a drop in the bucket.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We tell Black kids, if you go to college, you work hard, you get a good paying job, you’ll have the American dream,” said <a href="https://law.emory.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/brown-profile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dorothy Brown</a>, a law professor at Emory University who researches the racialization of the U.S. tax system. But this just isn’t what’s happened. Instead, Black Americans are disproportionately saddled with crippling student loan debt.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The existing solutions to this problem haven’t worked out for Black Americans, either. Take <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven" target="_blank" rel="noopener">income-driven repayment</a>, a federal program that allows lower-income borrowers to pay a reduced share of their loans every month — with the promise of the remaining principal being forgiven after a certain number of years. This sounds promising, but because Black Americans have lower levels of wealth than white Americans at the same — and even lower — levels of income, this program is still regressive, not to mention <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/10/14/6970129/student-loan-repayment-plans-bob-shireman-ibr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complicated</a>. Moreover, a <a href="https://www.nclc.org/uncategorized/issue-brief-education-departments-decades-old-debt-trap-how-the-mismanagement-of-income-driven-repayment-locked-millions-in-debt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 report</a> found that just 32 people had <em>ever</em> had their student loan balance canceled through this program.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Add in the fact that Black Americans who graduate from college still face a <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w9873/w9873.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">labor market</a> stacked against them — which also contributes to the racial wealth gap — and it’s clear to see how higher education often leaves Black Americans behind, rather than offering them a true path to mobility.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, canceling student debt is at least somewhat politically feasible. Polls generally show Americans support student debt forgiveness much more than they do other programs that would help close the racial wealth gap, like reparations:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible, too, that given Biden’s lagging support among <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/01/1095466871/biden-polls-democrats-gen-z-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">younger voters</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ketanji-brown-jacksons-nomination-may-not-be-enough-to-turn-out-black-voters-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black voters</a> — <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/04/27/young-americans-want-government-take-action-student-debt-harvard-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both</a> of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2021/02/16/poll-huge-majority-of-black-voters-support-cancelling-student-debt/?sh=8268ca84c4da" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whom</a> overwhelmingly support at least some student debt forgiveness — he could see a boost in his popularity, especially among Democrats, if he cancels student debt. But then again, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congress-found-an-easy-way-to-fix-child-poverty-then-it-walked-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded child tax credit</a> was broadly popular among Americans, and it didn’t seem to buy Democrats much support. Furthermore, if Biden does end up canceling student debt by executive order instead of via Congress, given it’ll be next to impossible to get the 60 votes needed to pass it, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/us/politics/biden-executive-orders-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carries its own political peril</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And of course, canceling even the “right” amount of debt wouldn’t come close to eliminating the racial wealth gap, which could make this a hard political sell. The experts I spoke to were unanimous in the view that canceling student debt would not eradicate the racial wealth gap by itself. Research has found that enacting <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41996-020-00077-8?wt_mc=Internal.Event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&amp;utm_source=ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=AA_en_06082018&amp;ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst_20210126&amp;error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=b34d95af-05ce-4f08-831f-4783a23b50f7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a set of policies</a> — including student loan forgiveness — could significantly reduce the racial wealth gap, but canceling student loan debt on its own is just one step in that process.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">After a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/14/nyregion/buffalo-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist shooting</a> earlier this month at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-elementary-school-reports-active-shooter-campus/story?id=84940951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuesday’s school shooting</a> in Uvalde, Texas, guns have — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-views-on-gun-control-have-changed-in-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yet again</a> — emerged as a political issue that has dominated headlines. Democrats have issued <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senator-chris-murphy-pleads-for-action-on-gun-violence-641fb7c7244ff497c7f9c4c1bc96366c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impassioned pleas</a> for the government to more tightly regulate the sale of firearms, and if <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/guns-parkland-polling-quiz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past shootings are any indication</a>, we will soon get a fresh batch of polling data showing that solid majorities of Americans agree with them. But again, if <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/04/politics/congress-reaction-mass-shootings/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past shootings are any indication</a>, Congress will not pass any reforms, in large part because <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/05/senate-state-bias-filibuster-blocking-gun-control-legislation/638425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republicans oppose gun control reform</a>. And as happened so many times before, the strong public support for gun control will fade away with our memories of the shootings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight took a look at polling and media data to show how support for gun laws has increased amid intense media coverage of past school shootings, but then reverted back toward the previous mean as the media spotlight moved on to other issues. We examined the period around two school shootings in 2018 to see how coverage of those events corresponded with changes in support for increased gun control. Specifically, we examined data around the Feb. 14, 2018, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/teacher-coach14-year-freshman-florida-high-school-massacre/story?id=53092879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School</a> in Parkland, Florida, and the May 18, 2018, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/us/school-shooting-santa-fe-texas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shooting at Santa Fe High School</a> in Santa Fe, Texas.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, we compared &lt;a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;amp;t=summary&amp;amp;k=Afghanistan&amp;amp;ts=custom&amp;amp;sdt=20210801000000&amp;amp;edt=20210930235959&amp;amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;amp;fcs=comb&amp;amp;fdn=raw&amp;amp;fdr=day&amp;amp;fdt=-05%3A00&amp;amp;svt=zoom&amp;amp;svts=zoom&amp;amp;swvt=zoom&amp;amp;ssc=yes&amp;amp;sshc=yes&amp;amp;swc=yes&amp;amp;stcl=yes&amp;amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;closed-caption data&lt;/a&gt; from the Internet Archive’s &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Television News Archive&lt;/a&gt; for mentions of the two-word phrase “school shooting” on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC from Feb. 1 to July 31, 2018, and overall support for stricter gun control in daily tracking polls &lt;a href="https://civiqs.com/results/gun_control?uncertainty=true&amp;amp;annotations=true&amp;amp;zoomIn=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Civiqs during the same period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>10</sup></a> And as you can see in the chart below, there was an abrupt increase in the share of Americans who favored stricter gun laws right after each shooting, most especially Parkland, followed by a decline in support.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1486" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/skelley.rakich.SHOOTINGS-2-web.png" alt="Two line charts showing how overall favorability of stricter gun control laws rises, then drops, and how the number of 15-second cable news clips mentioning “school shooting” also rises, and drops again, after a mass shooting." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/skelley.rakich.SHOOTINGS-2-web.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/skelley.rakich.SHOOTINGS-2-web.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/skelley.rakich.SHOOTINGS-2-web.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="1604" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/skelley.rakich.SHOOTINGS-2-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/skelley.rakich.SHOOTINGS-2-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/skelley.rakich.SHOOTINGS-2-mobile.png?w=640 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/skelley.rakich.SHOOTINGS-2-mobile.png?w=1280 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Following each shooting, there was a huge surge in media attention and, correspondingly, a sharp rise in favorable views toward stricter gun laws. On the day of the Parkland massacre, about 51 percent of Americans told Civiqs they favored greater gun control, while about 42 percent were opposed. A week and a half later, the share who said they favored stricter gun laws had jumped to 58 percent, a significant increase in such a short period of time. In the wake of the Santa Fe shooting three months later, support rose from a little under 53 percent to a notch above 54 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bombarded by a high volume of terrible images and tragic stories right after a shooting, a small but meaningful number of Americans who opposed stricter gun control moved toward supporting it. For instance, the share of Republicans who favored increased gun restrictions rose from 12 percent to 22 percent in the 10 days following the Parkland shooting, and the share of independents in support rose from 45 percent to 53 percent. The share of Democrats who supported stricter gun laws also increased, from 88 percent to 92 percent. But as coverage tailed off — in the case of Parkland — or practically evaporated — in the case of Santa Fe — the share of Americans who favored stricter gun laws reverted toward the mean. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not to say that news coverage perfectly explains shifts in support for stricter gun control. After all, partisan views on this issue likely reasserted themselves after the initial shock of the school shooting moved public opinion — for instance, the share of Republicans who favored stricter gun laws had almost returned to pre-Parkland levels before the shooting at Santa Fe caused them to shift slightly up again. However, the media does help <a href="https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/The-Origins-of-Policy-Issue-Salience.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determine the salience of certain issues</a> by focusing coverage on particular problems facing the country. Simply put, if the media is covering something, Americans are more likely to think about it. Yet as the issue receives less attention, it moves out of the spotlight and something else takes its place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even if support for stricter gun laws in the immediate aftermath of mass shootings is inflated, though, it’s clear that Americans still support more gun control overall. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Gallup poll</a> from October 2021 — a survey that was not inspired by a particular mass shooting — found that 52 percent of Americans wanted stricter laws governing gun sales, while only 11 percent wanted less strict laws; 35 percent felt that gun laws should be kept as they were at the time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And stricter gun laws have been Americans’ preference for <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of the last 30 years</a>. Back in 1990, when Gallup first asked this question, a whopping 78 percent of Americans wanted stricter gun-control laws. That number gradually fell to 43 percent by 2011, putting it in an approximate tie with the share of Americans who were satisfied with U.S. gun regulations. But the next year, in the immediate aftermath of the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, support for more gun-sales restrictions increased to 58 percent, and it has remained around that high ever since — with some temporary spikes in response to major shootings like Parkland.</p>

On the one hand, Sandy Hook — which is sometimes considered a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314926/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tipping point</a> that normalized debating gun policy in response to mass shootings — appears to have had a lasting impact on American public opinion on guns. While pro-gun-control sentiment did fade in the months following Sandy Hook, it did not fall all the way back to its 2011 low — instead, the shooting seems to have fundamentally shifted the debate toward more Americans wanting stricter gun laws. On the other hand, though, support for gun control has markedly decreased since the 2019 spike associated with the shootings that summer in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, to a point even lower than the pre-Parkland (2018), pre-<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/anatomy-las-vegas-mass-shooting-deadliest-modern-us/story?id=59797324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas</a> (2017), pre-<a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482322488/orlando-shooting-what-happened-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orlando</a> (2016) baseline. (Civiqs has also <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/gun_control?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up on this trend</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that we’re about to see another large spike in support after what happened in Uvalde, but if history is any guide, it won’t last for long.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Days after a white gunman shot 13 people, killing 10, at a grocery store in a majority-Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, Fox News host Tucker Carlson <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-democratic-party-change-electorate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired a segment</a> about the “great replacement theory.” “We’re still not sure exactly what it is,” Carlson claimed about the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/explainer-white-replacement-theory-fuels-racist-attacks-84749601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist, white-supremacist conspiracy theory</a> that the population of white Americans is being systematically and intentionally “replaced” by nonwhite immigrants and their children, something the suspected shooter espoused prior to the attack. Yet elements of the theory have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/15/us/replacement-theory-shooting-tucker-carlson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">echoed by mainstream figures on the right</a>, including Carlson, as well as GOP members of Congress like Reps. Matt Gaetz and Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking Republican in the House. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In last week’s segment, Carlson detailed the version of the theory he’s been spreading for years (more than 400 times according to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/04/30/us/tucker-carlson-tonight.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent New York Times analysis</a>). “There is a strong political component to the Democratic Party’s immigration policy,” Carlson said before airing a handful of clips of Democrats that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/24/how-tucker-carlson-twisted-2015-clip-biden-into-conspiracy-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t actually demonstrate</a> what he claims. “They say out loud, ‘We are doing this because it helps us to win elections.’” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This more mainstream version of the replacement theory hides behind justifications that the criticism of changing American demographics is about politics and power. It’s a narrative so prevalent on the right that nearly half of Republicans believe that immigrants are being brought to the country for political gains. According to<a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/immigration-attitudes-and-conspiratorial-thinkers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> a poll conducted in December by the <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/immigration-attitudes-and-conspiratorial-thinkers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>, 47 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement that “there is a group of people in this country who are trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants who agree with their political views.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But those justifications are built on false assumptions about American demographics and immigration: that white people will soon be a minority in this country, that immigrants and non-white voters are all Democrats, and that no longer being the majority group means a loss of power. When those assumptions are torn down, the true justifications for these fears become transparent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The theory’s first inaccurate assumption is that white Americans will soon become a minority population. But using any nuanced reading of the data, that’s not true. Yes, in 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau published a <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/releases/2015/cb15-tps16_graphic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">population projection</a> that by the year 2044, non-Hispanic white Americans would no longer be a numerical majority in the country. But not being the majority is not the same as being a minority: Even in that projection, non-Hispanic white Americans would still make up a <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p25-1143.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plurality of the population</a> compared with any other race. And non-Hispanic white Americans are not the only white Americans. When you include American Latinos who identify as solely white, you wind up with “more than 70 percent of the population identifying at least in part as white in 2044 and over two-thirds in 2060,” according to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/racial-projections-in-perspective-public-reactions-to-narratives-about-rising-diversity/E9D8F620367A68C3267301F342232A1B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research published last year</a> in the journal “Perspectives on Politics.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That nuance affects how Americans think about the future. The same research showed that presenting the demographic-shifts story as “majority-minority by 2044” prompts white Americans to say they feel more anxious and less hopeful. But when you present the same demographic changes in a more nuanced (and accurate) narrative around a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/22/1029609786/2020-census-data-results-white-population-shrinking-decline-non-hispanic-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rise in multiculturalism</a> and Americans who identify as more than one race, white Americans’ self-reported anxiety was lower, even compared with a control group presented with basic facts about demographic changes with no narrative framing, according to the same study. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s almost like inaccurately framing demographic shifts as a zero-sum game leads to inaccurate perceptions among Americans that can amplify fear and resentment. (Why the idea of losing their status as a numerical majority is so anxiety-provoking to some white Americans is <a href="https://twitter.com/PadmaLakshmi/status/1526205871646248961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another question entirely</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another plot hole in the mainstream replacement narrative is the assumption that immigrants will solely support the Democratic party. Stefanik’s campaign ran a <a href="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d4742d_b8421b658c7444e89ef524a995b15098~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_594,h_950,al_c,q_85,enc_auto/ImG-1.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ad</a> in September that echoed replacement-theory rhetoric. “Radical Democrats” were planning “a PERMANENT ELECTION INSURRECTION,” the ad claimed. “Their plan to grant amnesty to 11 MILLION illegal immigrants will overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority in Washington.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Carlson, too, has repeatedly warned of a so-called <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/may/19/tucker-carlson-feigned-ignorance-over-great-replac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic plot</a> to “import an entirely new electorate from the Third World and change the demographics of the U.S. so completely they will never lose again.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even he concedes that this narrative is flawed, pointing out in his show last week that many non-white and immigrant voters are, in fact, Republican. In the 2020 election, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-latinos-really-moved-toward-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 2 in 5 Latino voters</a> cast a ballot for then-President Donald Trump. And, as my colleague Alex Samuels has written, messaging about racial grievances might, perhaps counterintuitively, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-gops-grievance-politics-might-not-turn-off-conservative-latino-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attract some Latino voters</a> to the Republican Party. In fact, the GOP attracts voters from every racial group, and while white voters may be its base, not all nonwhite or immigrant voters are Democrats. That’s to say nothing of the fact that not all immigrants are naturalized and able to vote (take it from this immigrant, who has lived and worked in the U.S. for eight years and still can’t vote). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another flawed assumption baked into the mainstream presentation of replacement theory is that losing a numerical majority means losing power, but in America, that’s not the case. The reality is that the demographic makeup of the U.S. has been shifting for decades, yet those in positions of power have not fully shifted to match. White men made up about 35 percent of the U.S. population yet held 85.8 percent of Fortune 500 CEO positions in 2020, according to a <a href="https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/diversity_update_2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from Richard Zweigenhaft</a>, a professor emeritus of psychology who studies diversity at Guilford College in North Carolina. The handful of those seats not occupied by white men are held almost exclusively by white women: Just 1 percent of the Fortune 500 CEOs are Black, 2.4 percent are East Asians or South Asians and 3.4 percent are Latino, per Zweigenhaft’s 2021 report. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our elected leaders remain out of step with the U.S. population as well. While the current Congress is the most racially diverse we’ve had, it’s still whiter than the general population. People who identify as non-Hispanic white made up <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61.6 percent</a> of the U.S. population in 2020, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but accounted for <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/racial-ethnic-diversity-increases-yet-again-with-the-117th-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">77 percent of the voting members</a> in Congress. <br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To even engage with these incorrect assumptions feels a bit like legitimizing their baseless premise, but when about <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/immigration-attitudes-and-conspiratorial-thinkers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a third of Americans</a> believe a conspiracy theory based on misleading presumptions, there’s value in carefully deconstructing the false narrative. And when the toothpick scaffolding that holds up the theory is exposed, it’s clear what’s really supporting this narrative: racism and fear.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">After pursuing a vendetta against statewide Georgia Republican officials for more than a year, all of former President Trump’s endorsees failed to unseat incumbents in the state on Tuesday. Gov. Brian Kemp bested his Trump-backed challenger by more than 50 points and even Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who wrote a book about Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, won outright to avoid a runoff. Trump’s endorsees in open races, such as Herschel Walker in the Senate primary and Burt Jones in the lieutenant governor primary, fared better. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew recaps the night’s contests in Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Americans have long taken for granted the constitutional right to an abortion, established by the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Throughout most of the fall in 2021, Democrats, and especially Republicans, still thought that Roe would more likely than not remain the law of the land for the foreseeable future — even as the high court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to block a Texas law</a> from taking effect on Sept. 1 that lawmakers designed to flout Roe by banning abortions once they said cardiac activity was detected, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/h4zvi2yb6c/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;polling from YouGov/The Economist conducted Sept. 18-21&lt;/a&gt;, only 16 percent of U.S. adult citizens said they thought it was definitely or very likely that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe, compared with 40 percent who said they thought the court would unlikely or never overturn Roe. Similarly, 35 percent of adults &lt;a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3820" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;surveyed in a Sept. 10-13 Quinnipiac University&lt;/a&gt; poll said Roe would likely be overturned in the next few years, compared with 54 percent who said it was not likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those views started to change in December, though, following <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/19-1392_4425.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oral arguments before the Supreme Court</a> over the constitutionality of Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. More Americans began doubting Roe would survive after the court’s conservative justices <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-hears-historic-case-fate-abortion-rights/story?id=81488696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised the prospect of overturning nearly five decades</a> of legal precedent on abortion rights during the hearing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the chart below shows, Democrats have consistently been pessimistic about Roe being overturned since those oral arguments in December, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the leak of an initial draft Supreme Court opinion</a> in May showing that a majority of conservative justices were ready to overturn Roe, there was a sharp spike in the share saying it “will definitely” or “very likely” be overturned. Even Republicans, who have been less likely than Democrats to think Roe would ever be struck down, now generally think it’s going to happen.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Both parties increasingly think Roe will be overturned" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wPcSH/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The reality that Roe might be overturned has also shifted how Americans prioritize abortion as an issue. For decades, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those who opposed abortion rights</a> (generally speaking, Republicans) rated the issue as more important than those who supported abortion rights (generally speaking, Democrats), but as the chart below shows, the two parties’ priorities swapped after Texas’s abortion ban went into effect, which I first <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-may-now-motivate-democrats-more-than-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about in October</a>. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Threats to abortion access have changed voters' priorities " aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HNK1l/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the divide between Democrats and Republicans on the importance of abortion as an issue has only gotten wider, especially after the draft Supreme Court opinion was leaked in May. In the two surveys conducted by YouGov/The Economist since then, a record share of voters who backed President Biden in 2020 have rated abortion as a “very important” issue, by <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/o1zu29c4cp/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61 percent</a> and <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/8ew54v1ohy/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63 percent</a>, up from an average of about 42 percent in August surveys.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August results are the average of five weekly surveys conducted between July 31 and Aug. 31, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> Compare that with 37 percent and 40 percent of 2020 Trump voters who rated abortion as a “very important” issue in May, down from an average of about 45 percent in August polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not only are Democrats more concerned now, but they're also rating abortion as much more important to their midterm vote for Congress now than they did four years ago, according to <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_051222.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling from Monmouth University</a>. In the 2018 midterms, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_082218.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prioritize abortion as their most important issue</a> in choosing whom to vote for in Congress, but in May, 32 percent of Democrats said abortion was the most important issue in determining their vote, compared with 17 percent of Republicans. The share of Democrats who said abortion was an “extremely important” issue in voting for Congress in 2022 (48 percent) is also up from 2018 (31 percent), while the share of Republicans who said the issue was “extremely important” in 2022 (29 percent) is down from 2018 (36 percent). </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Abortion is now much more important to Democrats" aria-label="Grouped Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7jthb/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="474" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The polling data from both YouGov/The Economist and Monmouth is consistent with a long line of political science research showing how <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00384.x?casa_token=YA_eYB9Q_zcAAAAA:8uXr0t0QkTJYWPgMma8zU-kNA0Y385PUTcsLpn_X1v935a63939B9C4KGVwmmrM3co7q3tffPsbewuew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threats</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/anger-gap/967D469A566F389E0C69099BA5486069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anger</a> often motivate people to take political action. When most Democrats considered abortion rights a given, other issues typically overshadowed it. Yet now that the status quo is on the verge of being upended, Democrats are increasingly prioritizing abortion rights and will likely <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/06/liberals-anger-roe-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">channel their anger over Roe being struck down</a> into various forms of political participation. Meanwhile, now that Republicans look likely to win their long battle to overturn Roe, the issue is unlikely to have the same potency in GOP politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It remains to be seen, though, how these changes in voters’ priorities will affect future elections. Thus far, the leaked draft Supreme Court opinion has had no discernible impact on which party voters would support in a congressional election in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s generic ballot polling average</a>. But as FiveThirtyEight editor-and-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1527296591752663046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> on Thursday, the electoral effects will likely manifest themselves in more nuanced ways — especially after the policy implications of the final ruling become even more apparent during the summer and fall campaign. Nate Cohn, the chief political analyst for The New York Times, concurred, <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1527297461265453058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding</a> that “the effect [of overturning Roe] on individual races may prove to be more important than its effect on the national political environment, if abortion becomes especially salient in places due to extreme candidates or state policy stakes.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless, the reality that abortion rights can no longer be taken for granted has already sharply shifted many voters’ priorities. Those shifts will likely grow larger, too, if Roe is ultimately overturned this summer — in fact, they may become even more politically powerful moving forward. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Five states hold primary elections today, but it’s Georgia, with its busy slate of federal and state-level nomination contests, that is most <a href="https://youtu.be/fRgWBN8yt_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on our minds</a>. (You can read <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/11-primaries-to-watch-in-alabama-arkansas-minnesota-and-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our preview of the other four states’ primaries here</a>.) In total, 10 Georgia primaries have grabbed our attention, and in nearly all of them, the key question is once again whether the candidates endorsed by former President Donald Trump, mostly in connection to his false claim that his narrow loss in Georgia’s 2020 presidential vote was fraudulent, will prevail. Trump has become involved in almost two-thirds of the GOP primaries for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state and attorney general, making Georgia his most endorsement-heavy state that’s voting today.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Trump’s sway in Georgia may be limited. He’s endorsed seven non-incumbent Republican candidates across the six offices listed above, and while the five House incumbents he’s backed are likely to win, it’s unclear how many of the others will prove victorious outside of the Senate primary. This isn’t to say Trump’s influence is waning — remember that some of the GOP contenders he didn’t endorse are still pro-Trump — but it’s possible Georgia might be Trump’s most loss-filled state yet, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/politics/trump-endorsement-risk-pennsylvania/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may discourage him</a> from trying to throw his weight around in future primaries.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, 2nd Congressional District, 6th Congressional District, 7th Congressional District, 10th Congressional District, 14th Congressional District, governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>7 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with the primary where one of Trump’s non-incumbent endorsees looks most likely to prevail: Georgia’s GOP primary for <strong>U.S. Senate, </strong>where former University of Georgia football star Herschel Walker looks to be on a glide path to the nomination. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-13-most-important-republican-senate-primaries-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary polling</a> has put him at around 60 percent or better, clearly above the 50 percent threshold of support he will need to avoid a runoff, including a poll released last week by <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/GA-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-May-12-16_release-May-18-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News that found</a> Walker garnering 66 percent of the primary vote. In that survey, his closest competitor was state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, who took just 8 percent. In fact, Black is the only statewide elected official running against Walker, but his campaign never really took off. Walker ultimately consolidated Republican support, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/24/mcconnell-plots-return-to-majority-amid-trumps-influence-513970" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even among some initially skeptical party leaders</a> like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/expect-georgias-anticipated-primary-84922960</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Barring a big surprise, then, Walker will face Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in November. Some Republicans have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-alarms-sound-herschel-walker-georgia-note/story?id=84757313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worried that Walker’s past</a> might make him a weak general election candidate; Walker has faced allegations of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domestic violence</a> and making threats toward women, and he has <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-herschel-walker-confronts-his-mental-health-domestic-violence-allegations-33b96336-77c1-4b3c-915d-896746c52694.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with mental health</a> and faced scrutiny over <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/investigations/herschel-walkers-business-record-reveals-creditor-lawsuits-exaggerated-claims/D3FRT4RA7NFKTN23423ENPUP7A/?link_id=8&amp;can_id=8094ef3ca9e2fe4af466070f61a27eb7&amp;source=email-morning-digest-georgia-republicans-try-to-take-down-herschel-walker-despite-trumps-backing&amp;email_referrer=email_1499145&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-georgia-republicans-try-to-take-down-herschel-walker-despite-trumps-backing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aspects of</a> his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-college-football-entertainment-sports-bb1ef7d866ab99302974cce1816efb65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business record</a>. Notably, too, Warnock has already <a href="http://capitol-beat.org/2022/04/warnock-posts-record-setting-first-quarter-fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achieved a record-setting fundraising haul</a>, meaning the incumbent will have the resources to exploit Walker’s problematic past in attack ads. That said, even if Walker is damaged by these issues, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning electoral environment</a> might be enough to elect him anyway in a state that, despite President Biden’s victory here in 2020, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leans somewhat to the right</a> of the country as a whole.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a different story, though, for Trump’s candidate in Georgia’s Republican primary for <strong>governor.</strong> There, former Republican Sen. David Perdue looks to be headed for defeat. Angry at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/17/politics/kemp-perdue-trump-georgia-governor/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision</a> to sign off on Georgia’s 2020 election results, Trump <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/former-pres-trump-endorses-former-senator-david-perdue-georgia-governors-race/PTKYT6GGQNEBDIWX3NTRF4HJOU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw his weight</a> behind Perdue’s primary challenge. However, things have not played to the former president’s advantage. Namely, Kemp holds a solid lead in the polls: The same Fox News poll we cited earlier found Kemp leading Perdue 60 percent to 28 percent, up from Kemp’s 50-39 advantage in <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/GA-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-March-2-6_release-March-8-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News’s early March poll</a>. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/new-fox-5-poll-kemp-maintains-lead-over-perdue-ahead-of-tuesday-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 5/Insider Advantage survey</a> released on Sunday found Kemp only leading 52 percent to 38 percent, but that result still largely <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2022/governor/ga/georgia_governor_republican_primary-7402.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falls in line with other polling data</a> that suggests Kemp is likely to win renomination without a runoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perdue has also <a href="https://www.wabe.org/georgias-perdue-raises-2-3m-in-gop-primary-but-trails-far-behind-kemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lagged behind</a> Kemp on fundraising, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/brian-kemp-david-perdue-georgia-debate-2020-election-results/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his focus on the 2020 election</a> hasn’t led voters to doubt Kemp’s <a href="https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/politics/georgia-republicans-ready-conservative-legislative-agenda-for-campaign-trail/article_e7c240a6-b03c-52a4-8706-d3ed2fd76df7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative credentials</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=bca047b9-0028-4722-99cf-e8b225416609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls suggest</a> Perdue, who lost a Senate runoff in January 2021, <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/georgia-2022-poll-herschel-walker-leads-senator-warnock-49-to-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be a weaker</a> general election candidate than Kemp against the presumptive Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Stacey Abrams, who is running unopposed in her primary. Kemp <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2018&amp;fips=13&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly defeated</a> Abrams in the 2018 governor’s race, so the expectation of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-gop-could-make-or-break-its-chances-in-10-key-governors-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a competitive 2022 contest</a> could be another consideration for GOP primary voters headed to the polls on Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump likely won’t get his pick for governor, but his endorsed candidates for <strong>secretary of state</strong> and <strong>attorney general </strong>could find more success at the ballot box. And similar to Trump’s vendetta against Kemp, both picks are part of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democracy-is-on-the-ballot-in-these-11-secretary-of-state-and-attorney-general-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a widespread campaign to oust Republican incumbents</a> who defended the legitimacy of the 2020 election and replace them with Trump-backed candidates who would then <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/20/georgia-secretary-of-state-election-trump-00034001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run future elections</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s chief election officer, who <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/weve-found-systemic-fraud-overturn-election-georgia-secretary/story?id=74560956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended the legitimacy</a> of Georgia’s 2020 results and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected Trump’s demands</a> to alter Georgia’s vote tally to put Trump ahead of Biden. This move <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/politics/jody-hice-georgia-elections-secretary-of-state-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned Raffensperger Trump’s enmity</a> and a significant primary challenge from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/us/politics/jody-hice-raffensperger-trump-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-backed</a> Rep. Jody Hice. Speaking to Raffensperger’s vulnerability, <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/1Nu_pYaw5W-OXt24u58OlZP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/21/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hice</a> has outraised <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/1REdNZgHo_WMEPhuy5Ns1JP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/21/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the incumbent</a> $2.2 million to $1.7 million.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Raffensperger still has a fighting chance, in part because he’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/20/brad-raffensperger-stood-up-trump-now-hes-courting-trumps-base/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrayed himself</a> as a strong defender of election security by amplifying his support for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-georgias-new-voting-law-is-such-a-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia’s new law</a> that created <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-annotated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more stringent voting rules</a>. Limited polling over the past month and a half shows a highly uncertain race, too: One survey had <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=eaa28cb5-62e6-438f-a7ed-bbabb6478a06" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raffensperger ahead</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eiVGOGn8Icl5narLdAR-KfuOpLkFSbav/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another had Hice</a>, and two others had the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z8o3QDQ2mqow1YMnaRryq3OXrECD54O6/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two candidates</a> running <a href="https://thestarnewsnetwork.com/2022/05/16/the-star-news-network-kaplan-strategies-poll-trump-endorsed-hice-v-raffensperger-a-dead-heat/?feed_id=2345&amp;_unique_id=628255461d81e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neck and neck</a>. With two other candidates also running, the race could go to a runoff, and the eventual GOP nominee could face a competitive general election against the Democratic nominee — most likely state Rep. Bee Nguyen, <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/05/02/democrats-offer-vision-for-elections-in-secretary-of-state-primary-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has lapped the primary field</a> in fundraising.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Attorney General Chris Carr faces a head-to-head primary challenge from Trump-backed businessman John Gordon. Like Raffensperger, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2022-05-05/more-2020-election-clashes-in-georgia-attorney-general-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carr has defended the integrity</a> of Georgia’s 2020 election result, while Gordon has promised to expose the nonexistent widespread fraud. Just how weak Carr is, though, is tough to say. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible Carr could have an edge, <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/fnDgDkpS7KNfwFh0a_nRIpP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/23/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised nearly twice</a> as much <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/queLTdxdkhxuzcQU-fV-sZP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/23/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Gordon</a>, $2.6 million to $1.5 million, and he’s probably earned some goodwill among conservatives <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-attorney-general-race-features-incumbent-vs-trump-hopeful-in-gop-fight/Q4IDNQFEHBBYDPG73OPX2IG4RI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by launching or joining a number of lawsuits</a> against the Biden administration. However, we don’t have a ton of polls of this race, and the ones we do have <a href="https://twitter.com/HotlineJosh/status/1521470084383920131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show a large share of undecided voters</a>, suggesting it could go either way. The winner here will likely face Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan in November in another potential slugfest.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also near the top of the primary ballot is Georgia’s open-seat race for <strong>lieutenant governor</strong>. Unlike the incumbents running for governor, secretary of state and attorney general, Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/lt-gov-geoff-duncan-a-trump-critic-will-not-run-for-a-second-term-in-2022/C7ANUFARURAEJH5ACDE3L2AD5Y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided not to seek reelection</a> after criticizing Trump and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The GOP primary is now largely a contest between two state senators, Burt Jones and Butch Miller.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump has endorsed Jones, <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/cmCdMRpKd6bm3lIqeCu9QZP4048PFnxLXRUfdOLcQk01/46/null/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has raised</a> $4.1 million (including a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/lg-candidate-jones-didnt-report-private-campaign-flights-in-disclosures/WRXXGMJZHNCTDG2ZLHXBKYJGIE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 million loan to himself</a>), and Jones <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2022-05-04/gop-strife-democratic-crowd-in-georgia-lt-governor-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has focused on election-related issues</a>, including calls for an investigation into the 2020 election and the elimination of drop boxes for mail ballots. But Miller has rivaled Jones’s money, <a href="https://efile.ethics.ga.gov/#/exploreDetails/YzyW8vtpOQo-EoRL1aeDLy8tDI2u6FmaVm3Ptb7giM01/46/0/247/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised</a> $3.6 million. He’s also pushed more traditional conversative policy priorities in the state legislature, including a bill <a href="https://thecurrentga.org/2022/04/05/republicans-add-transgender-sports-ban-to-divisive-concepts-bill-pass-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to ban transgender girls from playing high school sports</a> that became law. He may also have gotten a late opening when news broke that Jones <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-georgia-campaigns-government-and-politics-campaign-contributions-5bab8a2810c1ba96fbb9b31cd2040def" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hadn’t been disclosing the use</a> of his family’s private plane in campaign finance filings. But like some of the other down-ballot statewide races, there are a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eiVGOGn8Icl5narLdAR-KfuOpLkFSbav/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ton of undecided voters in the polls</a>, so it’s hard to say how this race plays out. Democrats hope to make a play for this office, too, although they have a very crowded primary field, so a runoff seems likely to decide their nominee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turning to competitive primaries under Georgia’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new House map</a>, Trump has weighed in on two open-seat contests in safely Republican districts. Former state ethics commission chair Jake Evans, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/trump-picks-a-side-in-georgias-6th-district-race/EKFJVQQ2NJEOHKARE2NV7UR2HQ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s pick</a> in the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/election-2022-complete-guide-to-georgias-6th-congressional-district-race/HVEWZKGESNFQBGTEAYXYCJDBEE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redrawn and now-much redder</a> <strong>6th District</strong>, may have a good shot at winning, too. Evans probably attracted Trump’s support thanks to his father Randy Evans, a major Trump donor who served as the U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg under Trump. And helpfully, the younger Evans <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2GA06164/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had raised $1.6 million</a> as of May 4, although nearly half of that was out of his own pocket. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, physician Rich McCormick, who narrowly lost as the GOP nominee for the 7th District in 2020, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0GA07273/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised $2.8 million</a> (including $400,000 in self-funding) in his bid for the nomination. Two days before Trump backed Evans in early May, McCormick’s campaign <a href="https://www.richmccormick.us/poll-dr-rich-mccormick-continues-to-dominate-in-ga-6-leads-by-25-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a poll</a> showing him at 38 percent, far ahead of the rest of the nine-candidate field. But given the crowded primary field, a runoff seems likely, probably between Evans and McCormick, although another contender could also surprise — <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/GA/06/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three others have raised</a> at least $500,000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over in the dark-red <strong>10th District</strong>, which Hice departed to run for secretary of state, former state Rep. Vernon Jones is also testing the power of a Trump endorsement. Jones initially announced <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/vernon-jones-georgia-2022-governor-race-candidate/85-15fab444-fb0b-42d1-b6b9-57352bc589d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bid for governor</a>, but <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/vernon-jones-georgia-2022-governor-race-candidate/85-15fab444-fb0b-42d1-b6b9-57352bc589d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump encouraged him to run here</a> to help Perdue consolidate anti-Kemp support. But Jones, a Black man and former elected Democrat who attracted attention with <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/republicans-kick-off-rnc-with-help-from-georgias-vernon-jones/EQHZJBHF2RGSJEQ5QAJOGZB7IM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his speech backing Trump</a> at the 2020 Republican National Convention, previously represented areas outside this district and is potentially vulnerable as a recent Democratic officeholder.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Jones <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/jones-collins-jockey-for-upper-hand-in-10th-district-gop-debate/54MKEMTAHRF4DM6BXCSMTHZJOE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised more than any of his seven opponents</a> in the first four months of 2022, making him one of the front-runners here. Jones’s chief primary opponent is probably businessman Mike Collins, <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/09/17/mike-collins-launches-10th-congressional-district-bid-in-trumps-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another strongly pro-Trump candidate</a> who lost a primary to Hice in this district in 2014 and whose father Mac Collins <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/C000640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">served in the House</a> for 12 years in the 1990s and early 2000s. We have no recent polling, but a runoff seems possible considering the crowded field.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The one House primary of interest where Trump has backed an incumbent is Georgia’s <strong>14th District</strong>. In that seat, Trump endorsed lightning-rod Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/06/1097232814/marjorie-taylor-greene-can-remain-on-ballot-judge-says-despite-candidacy-challen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to fend off</a> a formal challenge by a group of voters attempting to remove her from the ballot based on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/22/1094273441/marjorie-taylor-greene-is-in-court-as-part-of-a-legal-challenge-to-her-candidacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegations that she helped foment</a> the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of Greene’s primary challengers, health care executive Jennifer Strahan, has attracted <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/01/marjorie-taylor-greene-jennifer-strahan-poll-georgia-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some notoriety and funding from outside groups</a> in her bid to offer the district’s voters a conservative but less controversial alternative to Greene. However, Greene has raised a massive $9.3 million this cycle, so there’s little reason to think that she is vulnerable to a primary challenge. Democrats have a contested primary here, too, with a clear front-runner in U.S. Army veteran Marcus Flowers. But even if he does win the nomination, Flowers stands no chance of defeating Greene in this deep-red district, despite <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-long-shot-candidates-are-raising-more-money-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracting ample attention</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2GA14044/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dizzying amount of money</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The last Republican primary we’ll examine has seen no involvement from Trump, but it’s a race where the eventual GOP nominee could flip a Democratic-held seat. Longtime Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop is defending the light blue <strong>2nd District</strong> in southwest Georgia, and six Republicans are vying for the chance to take him on. We haven’t seen any polling here, but <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/republicans-line-up-for-chance-to-flip-georgias-2nd-congressional-district/OXIC3WCV5JF7LB57HN5RVFYHPE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the favorite may be</a> former Army officer Jeremy Hunt, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/GA/02/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has outraised the rest of the field</a> and has endorsements from Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Josh Hawley of Missouri. However, Hunt’s ties to the district are tenuous, as he only registered to vote in the area back in February, so it’s possible real estate agent and Air National Guard officer Chris West or former Trump administration official Wayne Johnson might be able to best him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having looked mostly at GOP contests, we’ll close with the most high-profile Democratic battle today: the party’s primary in the blue <strong>7th District</strong> in suburban Atlanta. This <a href="https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/u-s-reps-carolyn-bourdeaux-lucy-mcbath-exchange-criticisms-over-fundraising-email/article_2569026c-d265-11ec-8e27-938c8e7245fc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly bitter contest</a> features <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-6-house-races-where-incumbents-are-likely-to-face-another-incumbent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the six member-versus-member primaries</a> this cycle, and it’s a showdown between Democratic Reps. Carolyn Bourdeaux and Lucy McBath. Last November, McBath <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/targeted-by-georgia-gop-mcbath-switching-to-safe-democratic-district/OV227QR4VZCLVJNDP4ZBTHT2TY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to run</a> in the 7th after Republican mapmakers transformed her formerly swingy 6th District into a safe GOP seat. On paper, though, Bourdeaux might have an edge because she currently represents 57 percent of the new seat’s population, while McBath only represents 12 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet McBath, who is Black, may be a better fit than Bourdeaux, who is white, for a district with a voting age population that is only 33 percent white. McBath <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/GA/07/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also raised more money</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/mcbath-newman-everytown-2022/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the backing</a> of pro-gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, given McBath first got involved in politics after her son was shot and killed at a gas station. McBath <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=GA07&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also benefited</a> from $5.1 million in spending from outside groups (including $1.9 million from Everytown), while hardly anyone has come in to help Bourdeaux.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bourdeaux arguably has a <a href="https://voteview.com/congress/house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly more liberal voting record</a> than McBath, but that might be overshadowed by Bourdeaux’s effort <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with eight other Democratic House members last year</a> to force a vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill before considering a larger social spending package, a move that drew the ire of progressives. Still, Bourdeaux <a href="https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/colleagues-and-now-rivals-lucy-mcbath-and-carolyn-bourdeaux-spar-ahead-of-georgias-7th-district-primary-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has criticized</a> McBath for abandoning her seat to Republicans without a fight, and with no recent polling, we don’t really know where this race stands. It could even go to a runoff, as state Rep. Donna McLeod is also running and could win just enough votes to keep both candidates under 50 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s influence in GOP primaries will be sharply tested in Georgia, and a host of down-ballot races could prove to be quite competitive.

<p data-paragraph="main">In a primary cycle dominated by endorsements from former President Donald Trump — an action his predecessors generally refrained from — the Georgia primary is one of the biggest tests of Trump’s sway. He has endorsed at least seven non-incumbent Republicans in the state, including a challenger to Gov. Brian Kemp. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew previews Tuesday’s primaries in Georgia as well as the races in Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota and Texas. They also ask whether it’s too early to conclude that the leak of a draft opinion by the U.S. Supreme Court that would overturn Roe has had little impact on the political environment.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday brings the next big batch of primaries, as voters head to the polls in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia — plus we get a little bonus electoral action thanks to several runoffs in Texas and a special election in Minnesota. And thanks to former President Donald Trump’s attempt to dislodge multiple incumbents who refused to overturn the 2020 election, Georgia is the election on everyone’s mind this week, but there are even more races of note in the other four states — 11, to be exact. Here’s the lowdown on each of them.</p>



<h2><strong>Alabama</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, 5th Congressional District, governor, secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When Republican Sen. Richard Shelby announced in February 2021 that <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/02/08/alabama-sen-richard-shelby-announces-he-will-retire-after-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would retire</a>, the odds seemed high that deeply conservative Alabama would replace the results-oriented incumbent with a culture warrior in the mold of Trump. But the state’s GOP primary for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> hasn’t quite shaken out that way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2021/04/07/donald-trump-endorses-mo-brooks-for-u-s-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially endorsed</a> Rep. Mo Brooks, a Trump loyalist who was the first member of Congress who said he would <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2020/12/02/the-gops-electoral-mischief-491033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object to the 2020 election results</a>, and Brooks did indeed <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/adn-poll-brooks-leads-senate-race-but-britt-has-an-opening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead in most polls</a> during <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/plethora-of-polls-show-tightening-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021</a>. But then former Business Council of Alabama President Katie Britt, Shelby’s former chief of staff, jumped into the race with her old boss’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-al-state-wire-alabama-europe-senate-elections-61079f4b48741c2e2b668756f85a8bb5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement</a>, and former Army helicopter pilot Mike Durant, whose <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/14/us/mike-durant-rewind/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1993 capture in Somalia</a> was dramatized by the movie “Black Hawk Down,” poured <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AL00202/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9.5 million</a> into his own campaign. Meanwhile, Brooks’s campaign <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/17/politics/brooks-trump-alabama-senate-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled</a>, and by mid-March, he <a href="https://1819news.com/news/item/poll-reveals-tight-race-for-u-s-senate-03-23-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was trailing</a> both Britt and Durant <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/durant-leads-britt-in-new-senate-poll-brooks-far-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the polls</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mo-brooks-is-disappointing-trump-mulls-pulling-alabama-senate-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump noticed</a>, and on March 23, he <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/03/23/donald-trump-withdraws-endorsement-mo-brooks-alabama-senate/7139178001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrew his endorsement</a> of Brooks. Officially, Trump argued that Brooks had gone “woke” because he had told a crowd at a rally to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9ZxQsggbM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put [the 2020 election] behind you</a>.” But it’s hard to rule out the possibility that Trump just wanted to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid a loss</a> on his personal scorecard. (Consider, for instance, that Trump unendorsed Brooks almost seven months after his comments but only a few weeks after he stopped leading in the polls.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But a funny thing happened after Trump pulled his endorsement: Brooks started rising in the polls again. The Club for Growth, the anti-government-spending organization that has jockeyed with Trump for influence within the party, is <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/candidates/mo-brooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still backing him</a> and has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=ALS2&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $4.4 million</a> on his behalf. Perhaps as a result, Brooks gained 13 percentage points between late March and mid-May, according to <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/alabama-2022-britt-leads-u-s-senate-gop-primary-but-likely-faces-run-off-durant-tries-to-hold-off-brooks-for-second-place-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College</a>. And according to an average of the two <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/new-adn-gray-tv-poll-shows-tightening-senate-race-likely-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent polls</a>, Britt currently has 31 percent support, Brooks 27 percent and Durant 25 percent. If, as seems likely, no one receives a majority of the vote, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff election on June 21.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Brooks leaving the House to run for Senate, Republicans will also choose a nominee in his deep-red <strong>5th Congressional District</strong>. Madison County Commission Chairman Dale Strong leads the money race with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AL05102/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $1.1 million</a> raised, but he has <a href="https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2022/02/two-counties-gop-leaders-challenge-dale-strongs-right-to-run-for-congress-on-gop-ballot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come under fire</a> for relocating a local Confederate memorial (Strong says he did so to protect it). The second-biggest fundraiser (with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AL05128/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$552,504</a> raised) is former Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs Casey Wardynski, who has the support of the tea-party group <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/house-freedom-caucus-political-arm-endorses-casey-wardynski-in-al-5-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Fund</a>. None of the other four candidates has raised more than $170,000, but it’s possible this race could go to a runoff too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s also an unexpectedly spirited Republican primary for <strong>governor</strong>, despite the fact that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/28/governor-approval-ratings-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular</a> incumbent Kay Ivey is running for reelection. Last year, there were reports that Trump was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/26/politics/trump-2022-candidates-north-carolina-alabama-georgia/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with Ivey</a> for a state commission’s decision that didn’t let Trump hold a rally aboard an historic battleship in Mobile. Trump’s former ambassador to Slovenia, Lindy Blanchard, even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/02/politics/lynda-blanchard-running-for-governor/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the governor’s race</a> after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-governors-distance-themselves-from-trump-drawing-his-ire-11637357756?AID=11557093&amp;PID=6415797&amp;SID=bi%7C619a6cf22c5ebc3a531046d2%7C16529916813120tdxho4l&amp;subid=Business+Insider&amp;cjevent=42d40d09d7b111ec838ff7a40a82b82c&amp;tier_1=affiliate&amp;tier_2=moa&amp;tier_3=Business+Insider&amp;tier_4=3861930&amp;tier_5=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Frepublican-governors-distance-themselves-from-trump-drawing-his-ire-11637357756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking with Trump</a> about the possibility that he would endorse her. (The endorsement never materialized.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The wealthy Blanchard has donated <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/04/18/gov-kay-ivey-leads-opponents-in-fundraising-in-gubernatorial-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$7.8 million</a> to her own campaign, and businessman Tim James (the son of former Gov. Fob James) has also raised $2.3 million for his <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/01/13/tim-james-begins-third-gubernatorial-run-with-fire-and-brimstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-establishment campaign</a>. But Ivey has raised $6.6 million and has used it to cement her Trumpy credentials, including airing commercials on her support for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xztJw19j-CY&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Lie</a> — the false idea that the 2020 election was fraudulent — and <a href="https://twitter.com/kayiveyforgov/status/1513604794929328134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-immigration ads</a> rooted in the baseless “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which claims that people of color are displacing white people in the U.S. in order to advance a liberal political agenda. The only question at this point seems to be whether Ivey can avoid a runoff: In <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/alabama-2022-britt-leads-u-s-senate-gop-primary-but-likely-faces-run-off-durant-tries-to-hold-off-brooks-for-second-place-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an average</a> of the two <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/poll-shows-ivey-close-to-avoiding-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent polls</a>, she took 47 percent of the vote, while James was back at 17 percent and Blanchard at 12 percent. However, when you consider that 13 percent of voters were still undecided, the numbers should be there to put her over 50 percent in the end.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, with term limits forcing <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/04/alabama-secretary-of-state-john-merrill-admits-affair-wont-run-for-us-senate-theres-no-excuse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incumbent John Merrill</a> to retire, the Republican primary for <strong>secretary of state</strong> will almost certainly decide who administers the 2024 election in this dark-red state. Former state Administrator of Elections Ed Packard, who worked in the secretary of state’s office for more than 24 years, is the only candidate who believes there is <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/02/spotlight-shines-on-alabama-secretary-of-state-race-as-views-over-2020-election-and-trump-loom-large.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence of massive voter fraud</a> in the 2020 election. However, he clocked in at just 2 percent in the <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/alabama-2022-britt-leads-u-s-senate-gop-primary-but-likely-faces-run-off-durant-tries-to-hold-off-brooks-for-second-place-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest poll</a> of the race. Instead, this race looks headed to a runoff between state Auditor Jim Zeigler (20 percent), who has the endorsement of <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/04/21/mypillow-ceo-backs-zeigler-for-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">businessman and Trump ally Mike Lindell</a>, and state Rep.

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8:30 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On paper, Republican Sen. John Boozman shouldn’t be in any danger for reelection; he has already been comfortably elected to the <strong>Senate</strong> twice, and Trump <a href="https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/trump-endorses-2022-re-election-of-u-s-sen-boozman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed his latest campaign</a> early last year. However, multiple primary challengers are accusing the <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/politics/2022/04/24/ads-from-soft-spoken-arkansas-sen-boozman-reflect-gop-fury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mild-mannered incumbent</a> of being <a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2022/04/05/boozman-blasted-for-private-remarks-about-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insufficiently loyal</a> to the former president because he <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/sen-john-boozman-wont-protest-electoral-vote-warns-against-undermining-constitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not support</a> overturning the results of the 2020 election. Former NFL player Jake Bequette has been the loudest of Boozman’s opponents, having raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AR00107/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a>. He’s also procured another <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00790071/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 million</a> in spending from a super PAC funded by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/22/boozman-bequette-republican-donor-arkansas-00027089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billionaire Richard Uihlein</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As such, Boozman hasn’t taken the race for granted, having spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0AR00150/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.9 million</a> from his flush campaign coffers and getting another <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=ARS2&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 million</a> in air cover from outside groups. A <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2022/05/undecided-voters-control-fate-of-runoffs-in-u-s-senate-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talk Business &amp; Politics/Hendrix College poll</a> from early May put Boozman at 45 percent, Bequette at 19 percent and former journalist Jan Morgan at 17 percent. However, Arkansas requires runoffs if no candidate gets a majority of the vote, and a runoff between Boozman and a single Trumpist challenger could get interesting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although it’s not competitive, the Republican primary for <strong>governor</strong> also deserves an honorable mention. With Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson term-limited, major Arkansas politicians like Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge initially threw their hats in the ring, but ultimately, former Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cleared the field with her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-endorses-sanders-in-run-for-arkansas-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old boss’s endorsement</a>. She is now well on her way to becoming the 47th governor of this dark-red state — a job her father, 2016 presidential contender Mike Huckabee, once had.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 15th, 28th and 30th congressional districts; attorney general</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, 9 p.m. Eastern in the western tip</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas already had its primary on March 1, but in the handful of races where none of the candidates reached the majority-vote threshold, runoffs will be held on Tuesday. We won’t be keeping up with every race on Texans’ ballots tomorrow, but there are some big ones to watch. First, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/26/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-2022-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement power</a> will be put to the test in Texas’s Republican primary runoff for <strong>attorney general</strong>, where embattled incumbent Ken Paxton will face off against Land Commissioner George P. Bush. It’s the main test of Trump’s endorsement power on the ballot in Texas tomorrow, and so far, polling suggests that Paxton is well positioned to win. A May poll from <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2022/05/15/texas-gov-greg-abbott-still-leads-beto-orourke-in-governors-race-poll-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dallas Morning News/University of Texas at Tyler</a>, for example, gave the Trump-backed incumbent a 6-point edge over Bush (41 percent to 35 percent). Notably, however, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has stayed on the sidelines for this race, while Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/12/18/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-and-george-p-bush-battle-over-alamo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has publicly clashed with Bush</a> in the past, <a href="https://www.danpatrick.org/patrick-endorses-paxton-for-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Paxton</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bush has repeatedly <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/02/george-p-bush-ken-paxton-texas-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knocked Paxton’s integrity</a>, as the incumbent is embroiled in a number of <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-ag-ken-paxton-accused-breaking-law-yes-again-n1287595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal and personal battles</a>, but it’s possible he won’t be able to overcome <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/12/george-p-bush-ken-paxton-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bush family dynasty</a> — the “Bush” name has been increasingly likened to the more moderate wing of the GOP. Some surveys suggest that might be a tough hurdle for Bush to overcome: A <a href="https://uh.edu/hobby/election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Houston</a> poll <a href="https://uh.edu/hobby/election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that <a href="https://www.txhpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TxHPF-2022gubernatorialelection.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about one-third</a> of likely primary voters would never consider voting for Bush — roughly triple the number who said the same about Paxton. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No Democrat has won a <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2012/sep/26/texas-democrats-have-lost-statewide-elections-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statewide race in Texas since 1994</a>, yet it’s worth keeping an eye on the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/17/texas-democrats-attorney-general-runoff-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive Democratic primary</a> runoff for attorney general taking place on Tuesday between Rochelle Garza, a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer from Brownsville, and Joe Jaworski, the former mayor of Galveston. Polling on the Democratic side has been sparse, but the aforementioned Dallas Morning News/University of Texas at Tyler survey had Garza leading Jaworski for the party’s nomination, 35 percent to 20 percent — although 40 percent of voters were still undecided. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond the marquee attorney general’s race, though, we’ll also be keeping an eye on a handful of congressional races. In and around Dallas, for example, state Rep. Jasmine Crockett is seeking to succeed the retiring U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democrat, in the predominantly Black <strong>30th District</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-30.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after barely missing</a> the majority-vote threshold needed to win outright in March. Crockett, who has Johnson’s backing, will face Jane Hamilton, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/17/jane-hope-hamilton-jasmine-crockett-tx-30-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a longtime congressional staffer and campaign adviser</a>, on Tuesday. What makes this race particularly interesting is that both have <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2022/05/16/jasmine-crockett-jane-hamilton-vying-to-replace-eddie-bernice-johnson-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racked up endorsements from prominent</a> Black leaders in the Dallas area. <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2022/05/16/jasmine-crockett-jane-hamilton-vying-to-replace-eddie-bernice-johnson-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some reports suggest</a> the race is still Crockett’s to lose given that she netted 48.5 percent of the vote in March, but <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/17/jane-hope-hamilton-jasmine-crockett-tx-30-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hamilton has attacked</a> Crockett for things like <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/31/jasmine-crockett-botham-jean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misrepresenting herself</a> as an attorney for Botham Jean, a Dallas man who <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/death-innocent-man-timeline-wrong-apartment-murder-trial/story?id=65938727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was fatally shot by an off-duty police officer in 2018</a>, that could hurt her with voters in the district. Overall, though, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the solidly blue seat</a> is one of the quieter primary congressional runoffs. Federal Election Commission reports show that, since early April 2021, Crockett and Hamilton have raised about <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2TX30178/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$567,000</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00779090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$654,000</a>, respectively.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The congressional race in Texas that’s arguably garnered the most national attention, however, is the rematch between Rep. Henry Cuellar and progressive attorney Jessica Cisneros in Texas’s <strong>28th District</strong>. The Democrats will go head-to-head, again, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-28.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuellar netted only 49 percent</a> of the vote in March, compared with Cisneros’s 47 percent. Cuellar also only <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/04/henry-cuellar-defeats-primary-challenger-120954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly beat Cisneros in 2020</a>. But the incumbent could be in real trouble this year. Just ahead of Texas’s primary, the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fbi-raid-us-rep-henry-cuellars-texas-home-office-said-tied-azerbaijan-rcna13005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBI raided Cuellar’s home</a> and campaign office, though his attorney has since said that Cuellar <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/rep-henry-cuellar-target-doj-investigation-home-office-raided-attorney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not the target of the investigation</a>. Even more damaging for Cuellar, though, is the revelation that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-could-strike-down-roe-v-wade-what-would-that-mean-for-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court might be ready to overturn Roe v. Wade</a>, the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion. Cuellar has a reputation as an anti-abortion Democrat, and Cisneros <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/abortion-may-deciding-factor-texas-cuellar-cisneros-democratic-runoff-1705750" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and progressive allies</a> have sought to highlight that. Cuellar, for his part, has tried to downplay his anti-abortion stances, <a href="https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Supreme-Court-draft-puts-Cuellar-in-hot-seat-over-17151736.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing a statement in May</a> that the leaked Supreme Court decision was not based on precedent and would “further divide the country during these already divisive times.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race in Texas’s 28th District is notable for another reason, too: It’s another example of younger progressives taking on moderate Democrats, who are often backed by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/23/nancy-pelosi-henry-cuellar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very established political players</a>. Unfortunately, there haven’t been any polls fielded here since the March primary, so it’s hard to know who has the advantage, but fundraising suggests that this will be another tight race. Both candidates have high-dollar groups contributing on their behalf — like <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1525258262140047363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMILY’s List</a> for Cisneros and <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1524773901829808128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mainstream Democrats PAC</a> for Cuellar. Meanwhile, <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00371302/1593938//" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-runoff FEC reports</a> for <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00709006/1593946/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both candidates</a> show that each has a little over $1 million cash on hand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the 28th District leans Democratic, there’s also a Republican matchup taking place tomorrow between Cassy Garcia, a former staffer for Sen. Ted Cruz, <a href="https://twitter.com/patricksvitek/status/1470451448601366531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who endorsed her</a>, and Sandra Whitten, the 2020 GOP nominee for the seat. In March, Garcia earned 24 percent of the vote to Whitten’s 18 percent. <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Republicans-Cassy-Garcia-Sandra-Whitten-compete-17173125.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to some reports</a>, though, Garcia, who has the backing of the <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1511065360430157830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP congressional establishment</a>, is considered the favorite heading into Tuesday.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Further east, in the state’s <strong>15th District</strong>, voters are poised to see another timeworn matchup between a progressive and a moderate Democrat. But what makes this seat — currently held by Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/01/texas-rio-grande-valley-congress-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is now running in a neighboring district</a> — arguably carry even higher stakes than the 28th District is that Republicans view it as among the most flippable this fall. Though Biden carried the district in 2020, the once-in-a-decade reapportionment process <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the seat more GOP-friendly</a> and, in turn, provides Republicans with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-congressional-map-could-give-a-huge-boost-to-gop-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ripe pickup opportunity come November</a>. The Democratic candidates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going toe-to-toe</a> on Tuesday are lawyer and Army veteran Ruben Ramirez and activist and small business owner Michelle Vallejo. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the March primary</a>, Ramirez led with 28 percent of the vote, compared with Vallejo’s 20 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More recent FEC reports, however, show that <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00797217/#cash-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vallejo has more cash on hand</a>. And while we also don’t have much polling on this race, <a href="https://314action.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/314-Action-TX-15-Primary-Runoff-Topline-Results-041822.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an April survey</a> conducted by GBAO on behalf of 314 Action, an advocacy group that works to elect STEM professionals to public office <a href="https://314action.org/candidates/ruben-ramirez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and is supporting Ramirez</a>, has Ramirez trailing Vallejo by 12 percentage points (49 percent to 37 percent). Whoever wins tomorrow’s race, though, will face a formidable challenge this fall: Republican Monica De La Cruz, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handily won her primary race in March</a> and already has the support of <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/31/monica-de-la-cruz-henderson-vicente-gonzalez-texas-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress’s GOP establishment</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/17/trump-endorses-monica-delacruz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Minnesota’s primaries are actually on Aug. 9, but we’re getting an appetizer of sorts due to the special election in the state’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong>. After the <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/02/18/minnesota-1st-district-representative-jim-hagedorn-dies-at-age-59" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death of former Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn</a> in February, both parties will choose their nominees to replace him on Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The biggest name in the 10-person Republican field is former Minnesota Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan, who is also Hagedorn’s widow. But both of those connections come with baggage. Carnahan was <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/19/under-fire-minnesota-gop-chair-carnahan-steps-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced to resign</a> as state party chair last year after a top donor with whom she was close was <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/19/minn-gop-officials-meet-amid-clamor-for-party-leaders-ouster" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicted for child sex trafficking</a>. Though she denied knowledge of the crimes, multiple former party employees also took the opportunity to accuse Carnahan of covering up workplace sexual harassment and fostering a hostile work environment. She was also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/embattled-minnesota-gop-chair-resign-79508025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded in December 2020</a> saying of her husband, “I don’t care. Jim, he’s going to die of cancer in two years. So be it.” Since Hagedorn’s death, his family has also <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2022/05/18/jim-hagedorns-family-suing-widow-jennifer-carnahan-for-medical-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued her</a> over what they claim is a failure to repay medical expenses.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Carnahan has raised more money (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MN01264/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$403,765</a>) than any of her opponents, but she’s closely followed by state Rep. Jeremy Munson (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MN01165/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$363,120</a>) and former Department of Agriculture official Brad Finstad (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MN01223/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$244,069</a>). A super PAC affiliated with Sen. Rand Paul has also spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00657866/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a> promoting Munson, who is known for <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/national/2022/05/jeremy-munson-could-be-the-next-republican-congressman-from-minnesotas-1st-district-why-are-so-many-republicans-trying-to-stop-that-from-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his obstructionism in the state legislature</a>. (Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he’s endorsed by anti-establishment Republicans like <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremymunson/status/1517889312016187392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremymunson/status/1505922481776963584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Jim Jordan</a>, as well as tea-party group <a href="https://freedomworksforamerica.org/press-releases/freedomworks-for-america-endorses-jeremy-munson-in-minnesotas-first-congressional-district/?hss_channel=tw-357013583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreedomWorks</a>.) On the opposite end of the spectrum, though, Finstad has benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/special-elections-outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MN01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$915,787</a> from Defending Main Street, a group that works to elect “candidates who are ready to work across the aisle to get things done.” The only polling we’ve seen here is an <a href="https://twitter.com/kirk_bado/status/1516086833557512196?cxt=HHwWiIC9ram8nIoqAAAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal poll</a> from Carnahan’s campaign that gave her the lead, but the poll is more than a month old and didn’t exactly come from an unbiased source in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the Democratic side, former Hormel Foods CEO Jeffrey Ettinger looks likely to emerge as the nominee, having outraised his closest rival <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MN/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$423,338 to $36,305</a>. But he’ll face an uphill climb in the Aug. 9 general election: While this southern Minnesota district elected a Democrat as recently as 2016, it rocketed rightward during the 2010s and now has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall.

<p data-paragraph="main">There are certain divides in the American electorate that we return to over and over again to explain why people think and vote the way they do. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/young-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/women-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/american-politics-now-has-two-big-racial-divides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education</a> — you know the drill. But other, harder-to-see divisions can be just as important, if not more so. Those hidden divisions aren’t about vital statistics or affiliations. They’re about how people see the world.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take the issue of abortion. It’s been in the headlines ever since <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a leaked Supreme Court opinion</a> suggested that five justices are ready to overturn Roe v. Wade, giving states the power to ban abortion for the first time in about 50 years. Plenty of speculation has focused on how such a ruling <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/05/roe-democrats-midterms-women-voters-metoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would affect female voters</a>, particularly if it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/03/abortion-midterms-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could push more women</a> to vote for Democrats in this year’s midterm elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that framing isn’t the only way to look at the issue. Even though abortion is often <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-and-Legal-Abortion-is-a-Womans-Human-Right.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented as a women’s issue</a>, it’s not a topic with a stark division of opinion <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/235646/men-women-generally-hold-similar-abortion-attitudes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between men and women</a>. If you dig into the polling and research, it becomes clear that the divide is less about people’s individual genders than the way they <em>think</em> about gender. People who believe in traditional gender roles — and perceive that those roles are increasingly being blurred to men’s disadvantage — are much likelier to oppose abortion than people who don’t hold those beliefs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The dividing lines of the abortion debate aren’t just about the morality of terminating a pregnancy. They’re also about views of power. Who has it? Who doesn’t? And who should? And the influence of those beliefs isn’t limited to abortion — it also spills into other culture wars, particularly about whether men face discrimination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whenever abortion is in the news, a lot of discussion inevitably hinges on <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/07/women-abortion-texas-law-top-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how women will respond</a>. Losing access to safe, legal abortion will mean that more women carry unwanted pregnancies. The issue itself is <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2022/0307/Can-you-have-women-s-rights-without-abortion-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often framed</a> in terms of women’s rights and autonomy. The problem is that not all women think about abortion that way. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americas-abortion-quandary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center</a>, men and women in the U.S. have exceedingly similar views about abortion’s legality.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Women and men have very similar views on abortion" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mSRvm/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="322" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The Pew poll did find that more women (40 percent) than men (30 percent) said they’ve thought “a lot” about abortion. But that doesn’t mean women’s views on the issue are more uniform. In fact, some of the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/marjorie-dannenfelser-abortion-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most prominent anti-abortion advocates</a> and <a href="https://www.thelily.com/the-new-face-of-the-antiabortion-movement-is-a-young-mom-of-6-who-listens-to-lizzo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicians</a> are women. One reason is that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1554477X.2015.985151?casa_token=ZXBWGEXXklIAAAAA:BPkFGtRT59VbdfkvyqgtgdnNzm-4Z36Kb4rhhzfuwkbUS-C77m3HQWRFV8Hi3sPgsEFI3C_hIbnT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religion is a good predictor of views on abortion</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/30/why-women-are-more-religious-than-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women tend to be more religious than men</a>. Some people who oppose abortion also see it as a women’s-rights issue but in a different sense of the term — they argue that abortion hurts women. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">People with different views on what's needed for gender equality, it turns out, also tend to think pretty differently about abortion — at least, that’s what <a href="https://twitter.com/teemoneyusa?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tresa Undem</a>, a co-founder of the nonpartisan research firm PerryUndem, has found. <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PerryUndem-Abortion-Public-Opinion-Survey-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a recent survey</a>,<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted using YouGov’s online panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> her firm found that 69 percent of voters who want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe agreed with the statement “These days, society seems to punish men just for acting like men,” while a similar share of voters who support Roe (63 percent) disagreed. In <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1647-supermajority-survey-on-women/429aa78e37ebdf2fe686/optimized/full.pdf#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2019 poll</a><a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted using YouGov’s online panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> that PerryUndem ran in partnership with <a href="https://supermajority.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supermajority,</a> a left-leaning advocacy group that focuses on women as a voting bloc, they found that likely voters who oppose abortion rights were much less likely, in general, to believe that the balance of power between men and women is unequal, or that issues like birth control access and women’s political representation affects women’s equality.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Views on gender roles line up with views on abortion" aria-label="Grouped Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qOCJN/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="743" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These findings line up with decades of research suggesting that views of abortion are intimately linked to how people think about motherhood, sex and women’s social roles. In the 1980s, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/21/style/profiling-activists-for-and-against-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sociologist Kristin Luker</a> argued that abortion is such an intractable issue because the people on either side of the debate have fundamentally different ideas about women’s autonomy. According to her, abortion-rights supporters saw <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520055971/abortion-and-the-politics-of-motherhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women’s ability to make decisions</a> about their bodies as fundamental to women’s equality, while anti-abortion advocates believed this focus on autonomy undermines the importance of women’s roles as mothers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That analysis can feel a little stuck in the Reagan era, particularly since <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2014/04/08/chapter-4-public-views-on-staying-at-home-vs-working/#:~:text=Roughly%20two-thirds%20of%20adults,for%20parents%20to%20raise%20children." target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for women working outside the home</a> has grown significantly since the 1980s. <a href="https://triciabruce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tricia Bruce</a>, a sociologist affiliated with the University of Notre Dame’s Center for the Study of Religion and Society who has <a href="https://churchlife-info.nd.edu/en-us/how-americans-understand-abortion-a-comprehensive-interview-study-of-abortion-attitudes-in-the-u.s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researched attitudes toward abortion</a>, said that people who oppose abortion aren’t “necessarily [coming] from a place where women belong in only one sphere, which is motherhood.” But views about power and control are still crucially important, she said. In contrast with a focus on women’s ability to make decisions about their own bodies, anti-abortion advocates see that choice within a broader context where other people have views that matter too. “We hear about women and their spouses, what’s the father’s role,” she said. “The idea is that this is not a decision that women should make in isolation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The divide between people who support traditional gender roles — especially those who think modern society is upsetting the balance of those roles by giving women too much power — and people who disagree with that position is spawning other culture wars. It’s partly why former President Donald Trump’s hypermasculine persona worked so well for him politically, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/opinion/josh-hawley-republican-manliness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why Republican politicians</a> continue to focus on the idea that men face discrimination, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-americans-more-divided-on-metoo-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fueled by a backlash to the #MeToo movement</a> and by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/young-men-college-decline-gender-gap-higher-education/620066/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declining rates of higher education</a> and <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/why-mens-social-circles-are-shrinking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising rates of loneliness</a> among men. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These arguments don’t appeal to all men, of course, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/31/662178315/on-metoo-americans-more-divided-by-party-than-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they do appeal to some women</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those messages tap into anxieties shared by men <em>and</em> women about the waning influence of traditional gender roles — in this case, traditional masculinity. Political scientists have found that when people are thinking about threats to their power and status, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536504218766551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political behavior and attitudes change</a>, making leaning on those anxieties a viable political strategy. For instance, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023117740699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an experimental study conducted in 2016</a>, the authors found that when men’s masculinity was threatened by the prospect of job loss, those men were more likely to say they wanted a masculine president — which, of the two candidates, was Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This also helps explain why there are usually bigger political divides <em>among</em> men and women than <em>between</em> them. For example, studies find that men who adhere to more stringent notions of masculine identity, which is used as a proxy for supporting traditional gender roles, look very different on political issues than men who identify as less masculine, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-so-many-men-stuck-with-trump-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we wrote in 2020</a>. Another way to see these divides is through the lens of partisanship. According to a <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/march-2022-aps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> by the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life, 25 percent of Democratic men and 20 percent of Democratic women agreed with the statement “American society today has become too soft and feminine,” while 78 percent of Republican men and 65 percent of Republican women agreed with it. And just 26 percent of Democratic men and 20 percent of Democratic women agreed with the statement “White men are too often blamed for problems in American society,” compared with 75 percent of Republican men and 60 percent of Republican women. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this complicates the conventional political wisdom about how and why voters will respond to political changes and messaging. It’s a little pointless to ask whether women as a whole would mobilize in response to the Supreme Court overturning Roe, since women hold such wildly different views on abortion. Instead, it’s more telling to examine other facets of people’s identities — like their beliefs about gender roles — that are less visible but more politically powerful.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Abortion is becoming personal for people who see it as a proxy for men, largely white men, taking away power from women,” Undem told us. “It’s not about a procedure. It’s about women’s place in the world.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The past year has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-of-americas-allies-have-their-own-big-elections-on-the-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full of elections</a> for major democracies and allies of the United States, including elections in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-things-to-watch-in-canadas-big-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/after-nearly-16-years-as-germanys-chancellor-angela-merkel-has-no-clear-successor-in-sundays-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59110828" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan</a> during September and October of 2021 and in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/emmanuel-macron-could-lose-frances-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France last month</a>. And <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/10/1091921429/australian-prime-minister-calls-may-21-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on May 21</a>, it will be Australia’s turn to decide its political future — change could be in the air Down Under, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because Saturday’s election for Australia’s House of Representatives could spell an end to almost nine years of rule by the Coalition, a political alliance of conservative-leaning political parties led by the Liberal Party<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think &lt;a href="https://www.liberal.org.au/our-beliefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;classically liberal&lt;/a&gt;, not left-leaning, modern American liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>12</sup></a> and its leader, Prime Minister Scott Morrison.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coalition &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_22_-_Political_parties" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has existed in some form&lt;/a&gt; since the 1940s. Along with the Liberal Party, the Coalition includes the rural-focused National Party, the Liberal National Party (the Queensland-only merger of the Liberals and Nationals) and the small Country Liberal Party based in the Northern Territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a> The Coalition has won a majority of seats in three consecutive elections — <a href="https://results.aec.gov.au/17496/Website/HousePartyRepresentationLeading-17496.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013</a>, <a href="https://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDefault-20499.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a href="https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HousePartyRepresentationLeading-24310.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a> — but polls now suggest the center-left Australian Labor Party is favored to retake power in Canberra, the Australian capital.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Led by Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, the ALP currently leads the Coalition 53.5 percent to 46.5 percent in two-party preference polling, according to <a href="https://www.pollbludger.net/fed2022/bludgertrack2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Poll Bludger’s average of recent surveys</a> (more on two-party preference in a moment) run by <a href="https://twitter.com/pollbludger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elections analyst William Bowe</a>. That 7 percentage-point advantage is significant because if the election results hew closely to the polls, such a result would amount to a 5-point swing in Labor’s vote share from the 2019 election, which is likely large enough to help the ALP overtake the Coalition’s narrow majority — 76 seats to the ALP’s 69 in the 151-seat chamber.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2019 election, the Coalition won 77 seats to the ALP’s 68. But &lt;a href="https://www.aec.gov.au/electorates/Redistributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;as it does after most elections&lt;/a&gt;, the Australian Electoral Commission &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/australian-federal-election-2022-redistribution-electorate-map-changes/a93d723d-f344-4657-8932-342389bc486f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;redistributed seats&lt;/a&gt; to better ensure population proportionality and a similar number of voters in each seat, eliminating a Coalition-majority seat in Western Australia and creating a Labor-majority seat in Victoria. So for calculation purposes headed into this election, the starting point is 76 Coalition seats and 69 ALP seats, with the remaining six seats won by third parties and independents in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a> Based on an <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2022/guide/calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election swing calculator</a> developed by Antony Green, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s chief elections analyst, a roughly 3-point swing in the ALP’s direction might be enough to give it a majority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But vote swings in Australia don’t always neatly translate into automatic gains and losses because members are elected from individual districts (“electorates” in local parlance). In elections to the House of Representatives, Australia <a href="https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/having-your-say/elections-and-voting/federal-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uses ranked-choice voting</a> to determine winners in each district. This system opens the door to a handful of independent and third-party winners, but most races still end up being narrowed to contests between candidates from the Coalition and the ALP, which is why observers focus heavily on two-party preference polls. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in a story that will sound familiar to the Democrats, the U.S.’s left-leaning party, the ALP is at a slight disadvantage in how its votes translate to seats: Labor may need to win about 52 percent of the two-party preference vote to earn a majority, whereas the Coalition could retain a majority with around 51 percent; meanwhile, a result that falls somewhere between those outcomes could result in a hung parliament where no party has an outright majority. (Australians will also vote for around half of the 76 seats in the Senate, the parliament’s upper house, using a form of proportional representation that gives seats to a wider range of parties. But while the Senate <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/platparl/c08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a fair bit of power</a> in Australia, it’s the House election that will decide which party is in control of the government, including Australia’s prime minister.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But before we go anointing Labor as the winner, the polls <a href="https://theconversation.com/labors-lead-narrows-in-three-new-national-polls-and-seat-polls-galore-183110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have narrowed in the last few days</a>, creating some doubt about the outcome. For instance, a <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/race-tightens-poll-shows-coalition-lifting-support-and-labor-dropping-20220517-p5am44.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Australian pollster Resolve Strategic</a> released on Tuesday gave the ALP a 51 percent to 49 percent advantage, down from 54 percent to 46 percent two weeks earlier. Over a similar period, another Australian pollster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/essential-poll-labor-remains-in-lead-but-race-tightens-after-liberal-party-election-campaign-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential Report found</a> Labor’s edge had narrowed from 4 points to 2 points. And this surely is giving the ALP — <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-19/federal-election-results-how-the-polls-got-it-so-wrong/11128176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and pollsters</a> — a sense of déjà vu: Back in 2019, the ALP <a href="https://www.pollbludger.net/bludgertrack2019/?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went into Election Day</a> with around a 3-point lead in the two-party preference polls, only to see the Coalition retain its majority with a <a href="https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HouseTppByState-24310.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-point victory</a> in the two-party vote that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48305001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrison called</a> a “miracle” win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Morrison <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-pms-ratings-tumble-lowest-levels-nearly-two-years-poll-shows-2022-01-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not an especially popular leader</a>, but he and the Coalition may still benefit from the lukewarm feelings the electorate has toward the opposition leader, Albanese. <a href="https://www.pollbludger.net/fed2022/bludgertrack2022/leaders.htm?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls have consistently found</a> more voters pick Morrison over Albanese when they’re asked who they prefer as the next prime minister. That said, Morrison’s brash reputation has attracted a fair amount of criticism, even prompting Morrison himself to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-morrison-vows-more-empathy-if-re-elected-pm-2022-05-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise to be more empathetic in the future</a>, so it’s possible there’s still some upside for Labor here. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for the issues, Morrison has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-australia-politics-idUKKBN2AQ0IA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received somewhat solid marks</a> for his handling of COVID-19, but that goodwill has receded from many voters’ minds with more expressing <a href="https://csrm.cass.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/docs/2022/5/views_on_policy_and_politics_on_the_eve_of_the_2022_Federal_Election_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concern over</a> things like the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-25/vote-compass-cost-of-living-make-ends-meet-poll-results/101011792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost of living</a>, elderly care and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2022/may/18/how-often-do-voters-top-concerns-feature-at-election-campaign-press-conferences-and-in-the-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a>. The Coalition <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-17/australia-s-ruling-coalition-pledges-improved-budget-in-costings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has campaigned on a promise to pare back the budget</a> in the aftermath of heavy spending amid the COVID-19 pandemic and <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/raising-wages-too-much-too-fast-puts-business-at-risk-coalition-20220519-p5amki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has criticized the ALP</a> for its larger spending plans. But the ALP has <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/federal-election/election-2022-labor-to-spend-74bn-more-than-coalition-budget/news-story/5437de07b2061756b9df15f4f5c50b55" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued that the country needs investments</a> in childcare, education and cleaner energy, while also <a href="https://kalkinemedia.com/news/economy/healthcare-in-australia-insights-into-budget-and-election-promises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shoring up Australia’s universal health care system</a>. Given its proximity and clout, China <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/05/15/australia/australia-election-xi-jinping-china-relations-intl-hnk-dst/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also been top of mind for voters</a>. The Coalition has tried to cast the ALP as soft on China, while the ALP has argued the government’s approach hasn’t worked given China recently signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands, a nearby small island nation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Climate change could have electoral repercussions, too. Despite a spate of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-61432462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural disasters in Australia</a> ranging from massive bushfires to heavy flooding, critics say climate change <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/17/australia-election-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has not received its due</a> in the campaign. A <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/australian-conservative-party-faces-teal-independent-threat-84825594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movement of climate-focused</a> “teal” independent candidates — referencing the color of their campaign materials — are targeting seats controlled by the Coalition. And if these independents are successful at picking off a handful of Coalition-held seats, they could end up controlling the balance of power if the election produces a hung parliament, giving them a chance to push for more climate-friendly policies in exchange for helping one of the major parties govern the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Learning how this will all play out, though, could take a bit of time because, much like in the U.S., <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/18/australian-election-polls-2022-show-race-tightening-in-final-stretch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Aussie voters than ever</a> are voting by mail — “postal voting” in local parlance. Already, around 5.4 million voters <a href="https://www.aec.gov.au/Enrolling_to_vote/Enrolment_stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of about 17.2 million</a> have voted early in-person or by mail, and another 1.2 million mail ballots are still outstanding. Because Australia <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/religion/bonotti-strangio-australian-experience-of-compulsory-voting/13531720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has compulsory voting</a> — those who fail to vote face a fine if they don’t have a good excuse — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/world/australia/compulsory-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we can expect</a> roughly 90 percent of the electorate to cast a ballot, which means that around a third of voters are already using some form of early voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So with all this in mind, make sure to check the Australian election results when you wake up on Saturday — Sydney is 14 hours ahead of eastern time in the U.S. — it’s one of the rare instances where you can watch election night coverage while you enjoy your morning coffee.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Our first FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll on the top issues facing Americans came out earlier this week. We found that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-2000-americans-about-their-biggest-concern-the-resounding-answer-inflation/">Americans are worried about inflation</a> more than any other issue, and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/05/16/consumer-grocery-habits-inflation/">April survey data from Morning Consult</a> shows how this is affecting Americans’ choices at the grocery store. In the poll, 43 percent said they bought generic to save on groceries, up from 36 percent six months prior. In a separate survey, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/05/17/inflation-impacting-consumers-long-term-financial-goals/">Morning Consult also found</a> Americans are growing more concerned about their financial well-being. In April, only 24 percent of Americans said they could handle an unexpected expense completely or very well, down from 29 percent last June, and 26 percent said they felt the same about securing their future financial security, down from 31 percent.</li><li>Feeling tired of politics? You’re not alone. A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/politics/cnn-poll-us-politics-burnout/index.html">new CNN/SSRS survey</a> found just 23 percent of Americans were “fired up” about politics, while 53 percent said they were “burned out.” Moreover, no one really feels like their political party of choice is doing well, as just 9 percent said they felt like they were mostly on the winning side, while 32 percent said their side was losing more than winning. (That said, 58 percent said neither state described how they felt.)</li><li>In the wake of the leak of a draft opinion that could signal the Supreme Court’s intentions to overturn Roe v. Wade, 60 percent of Americans <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/support-abortion-rights-hits-new-high-midterm-outlook-stays-mostly-unc-rcna28869">told NBC News</a> earlier this month that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the highest percentage the poll had found dating back to 2003. By comparison, 32 percent said abortion should be illegal with some exceptions and just 5 percent said it should be illegal in all cases.</li><li><a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3846">Quinnipiac University’s latest poll</a> found 69 percent of Americans support limiting the number of years a justice should serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, where currently justices have lifetime appointments. Remarkably, there is broad bipartisan agreement on this, too, as 77 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of Republicans back some sort of term limit, as did 69 percent of independents.</li><li>Mask-wearing to combat COVID-19 is no longer required on flights, but <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/392597/americans-divided-face-masks-flying.aspx">Gallup found Americans</a> continue to be split on whether the federal government should mandate face coverings in the air. In late April and early May, 49 percent said the government should enforce mask-wearing on flights, while 51 percent disagreed. Unsurprisingly, there were strong partisan divides on this question, as 81 percent of Democrats thought masks should be required, compared with only 13 percent of Republicans. Forty percent of independents also supported a mask mandate on planes.</li><li><a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_051622/">Monmouth University found</a> continued support for U.S. actions against Russia given its invasion of Ukraine. In May, 77 percent of Americans said they supported the economic sanctions that the U.S. has imposed on Russia, which is roughly the same as what Monmouth found in March. And despite concerns about high gas prices, almost 4 in 5 still support the U.S. ban on Russian gas and oil imports, also unchanged from two months earlier. Additionally, 77 percent said they supported sending weapons to Ukraine. However, these views haven’t boosted President Biden’s standing, as only 43 percent approve of Biden’s handling of the Ukraine situation and 50 percent disapprove, down from his 46 percent approve/48 percent disapprove mark in March.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Veronica wasn’t sure how the new disease she’d heard about on the news would affect her. It seemed unreal. She and her friends had just been <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mobile-app-plague-inc-china-tops-app-chart-coronavirus-spreads-1483600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joking about a game on the Google Play Store</a>, in which the goal was to wipe out humanity with a deadly virus. “We joked about it. We were like … this is the apocalypse,” she said. “And then it happened.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Veronica, who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy, is a 39-year-old Latina single mom who works as a part-time teller at a small bank for $15 an hour near a Gulf Coast city in Texas. She said she remembers feeling left out when she saw people take advantage of new opportunities to work from home. “I mean, we couldn’t do that. People wanted their money. They got scared. So we stayed at work. We didn’t have a choice.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In March 2020, when Gov. Greg Abbott <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/DISASTER_covid19_disaster_proclamation_IMAGE_03-13-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared a state of disaster</a>, the bank that Veronica works for emailed new directives to combat the pandemic. They locked their lobby doors, closed the building to visitors, used drive-through banking only and avoided transferring personnel from one branch location to another. The employees like Veronica who had to show up for work were encouraged to disinfect surfaces and wash their hands frequently. Soon, they’d be encouraged to wear masks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I felt safer with the doors closed, but I still didn’t want to come,” she said. Her branch operates with about two to three people in it at any given time, but during the pandemic’s beginning, she felt there were components to the work that some of them could have done from home at least sometimes to minimize their risk of exposure. “But they weren’t really offering anybody remote [work], except upper management,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The doors stayed locked until fall 2020, when patrons could once more enter the lobby for regular banking, as if the pandemic were over. Veronica said people were supposed to wear masks, but the bank didn’t enforce <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/23/peaster-superintendent-texas-mask-mandate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state’s mandate</a>. “And they kind of told us not to make people feel like they had to,” she said. “So we chose our battles.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Veronica lives with her retired mother and eight-year-old son and was worried about bringing COVID-19 home to them. She also smokes and was afraid that the virus could make her very ill. But neither she nor her son became sick. Instead, during the first summer of the pandemic, her mother contracted COVID-19, possibly through a friend, and she was hospitalized the week after July 4. Veronica had only two weeks of paid leave to take care of her hospitalized mom before she had to return to the office. (Veronica says she tested positive after her mother returned from the hospital, then tested positive a second time, during the delta wave, but she said she never had symptoms.) When her mother came home in August, Veronica was left alone to handle child care, taking care of her mother and continuing to report to work. Her son stayed with his father during the week, and Veronica felt awful about it because he’d always been with her.. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trying to balance caring for her mother while her son still had remote and in-person classes was overwhelming. Veronica was also scared her son would bring the virus home, so she decided to withdraw him from school and try homeschooling him, thinking it would be easier to manage. “I didn’t see any other choice at that time, and I’m glad that I did,” she said. “I wouldn’t have made it out.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The weight of the pandemic’s changes and dangers have fallen unevenly on different groups in the United States, but women like Veronica are among those who shouldered the biggest burdens. Inequalities existed before COVID-19, of course, but in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-reminded-us-of-just-how-unequal-america-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many ways they worsened</a> over the past two years. One key division has been how our employers adapted to a deadly, rapidly spreading virus. For many workers, March 2020 marked the dawn of the work-from-home era, a change that seems mostly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2022/02/01/remote-work-is-here-to-stay-and-will-increase-into-2023-experts-say/?sh=3dce36eb20a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here to stay</a>. But that’s not true for everyone.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The changes in remote work launched by the pandemic have been dramatic. The number of hours worked from home skyrocketed in 2020. An April 2021 working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research estimated that telework accounted for only 5 percent of paid work hours before the pandemic, but between April and December 2020, <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28731/w28731.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was about 50 percent</a>. Even now, more than two years after the pandemic began, many workplaces still don’t have their entire staff reporting to an office five days a week, and many are unlikely to do so ever again. According to a working paper from <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/will-it-stay-or-will-it-go-analysing-developments-in-telework-during-covid-19-using-online-job-postings-data_aed3816e-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indeed.com and OECD</a>, the share of job postings on Indeed that mentioned remote work roughly tripled during the pandemic — and was still <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/12/16/will-remote-work-persist-after-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5 percent of job postings in September 2021</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But most Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t have jobs in which telework is an option</a>. There are fields where that’s not surprising: hospital jobs, factory jobs, jobs at grocery stores and retail outlets, jobs delivering food, among numerous others. There are other jobs, too, in which workers might have been able to work from home, but their workplaces lacked the technology or resources.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it is women who are overrepresented in these jobs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In March, the Women &amp; Politics Institute at American University and the Barbara Lee Family Foundation <a href="https://www.genderontheballot.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-New-Normal-3.8.22-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a report</a> showing that 49 percent of women likely to vote in the 2022 election felt burned out since the start of the pandemic. Moreover, among those making less than $50,000 a year, 67 percent said they were not working from home. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1218641861-1024.jpg" alt="Grocery store cashiers wear protective equipment" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1218641861-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1218641861-1024.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1218641861-1024.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>For a lot of Americans, telework hasn’t been an option during the pandemic, and many of those jobs offer low wages. <p>Joe Raedle / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">A recent report by the <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FINAL-GQR-NWLC-survey-slides-3.29.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Women’s Law Center had similar findings</a>. Notably, it found that among adults making less than $15 an hour, which included 48 percent of women and 25 percent of men, women were more likely than men to say they’d lost or quit a job during the pandemic — 41 percent of women, 33 percent of men. Low-paid women were also twice as likely as women overall to have changed jobs during the pandemic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I spoke to 19 women who fell into these categories and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-you-a-woman-who-cant-work-from-home-during-the-pandemic-we-want-to-hear-from-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volunteered to be interviewed</a>. Among them were women who chose to go into their offices because they felt safe with the precautions their companies had put in place, or because they felt it would be too hard to work from home, or because their duties made them key employees for their offices. But many others were required to report to an office if they wanted to keep their jobs. Some women felt that their safety concerns were respected, while others struggled to keep up with the latest public health guidance despite coworkers and bosses who did not. In general, the women whose experiences were better had workplaces that they felt prioritized their safety and were flexible and responsive to their needs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maria Saavedra Karlsson is a pediatrician who’d spent most of her career in children’s hospitals but began working at a nonprofit urgent-care clinic before the pandemic. Because she works with patients, she continued working in person. She told me about the eerie feeling of driving down empty highways that were normally crowded, but she said she knew her patients needed her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the clinic’s clientele were low-income Latino residents of Southern California, where Karlsson lives. She said that a lot of the clinic’s adult patients as well as the parents of their child patients had continued to work through the pandemic, and that case counts at the clinic remained high during almost every wave.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Karlsson said the clinic’s management, who did not work on site, were reluctant to expand telemedicine, which almost all the clinic’s doctors agreed was better for everyone. Patients also preferred telemedicine, Karlsson said. When doctors were sick or in quarantine, they’d see clients remotely via telehealth technology, and the doctors found they could easily see 35 to 40 patients a day, comparable with the amount they could see in person. Patients were also safer in their homes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Karlsson and her colleagues tried to convince the clinic’s management to do more telemedicine. “We tried to take a day off and actually just volunteer to do telehealth and show them how effective that was,” she said. “It didn’t work.” Instead, their patients had to come into the clinic, which she felt was unnecessary exposure for everyone. The stress of it encouraged Karlsson to leave the clinic and work as a telehealth doctor for an online company while she also started her own practice seeing patients in their homes, but she estimated that the move cost her about 75 percent of her income. </p>

That impacts not only their earnings now but also their futures, as many are struggling to build up retirements or recover income lost over the past two years. According to the Women &amp; Politics Institute/Barbara Lee Family Foundation report, 55 percent of female likely voters making less than $50,000 a year said that their personal financial situation was worse now than before the pandemic, including 27 percent who said it was a lot worse.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Others I spoke with were transitioning to new jobs not just because of the stresses of in-person work during a pandemic, but also because they felt a lack of respect from their bosses. Taylor Anne Barriuso is a 29-year-old white woman and an academic advisor at a state college in Iowa, and she said her administration required advisors like her to return to campus in the fall semester of 2020. “There were very few students on campus, and the meetings with students were almost exclusively virtual at that point,” she said, adding that many professors and other higher-up administrators were able to choose whether they worked or taught remotely. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that she had to return to in-person work early isn’t the only reason she plans to leave her job — she also wants to attend graduate school for speech-language pathology — but it was a factor. “It did contribute to kind of an overall feeling of … micromanagement. … There was a kind of general feeling of distrust that we were still doing our jobs from home,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Women with people-facing jobs often found themselves with extra duties. Lindsay Ellis, a 35-year-old Black woman who works as a fitness director at a gym in a city in North Carolina and, like many, was furloughed early in the pandemic. When her gym opened back up in November 2020 and she returned to work, she had to enforce mask mandates that were frequently changing and often challenged by her clients. Ellis quickly became aware of how much sweat and heavy breathing filled the cycling room where she teaches classes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ellis thought she’d survive a COVID-19 infection but was worried about long COVID, which could impact her lung health for months and keep her from working. “I’m surrounded by hundreds of people a day, and members who are supposed to wear masks had quit [wearing them],” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, women staff <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Low-Wage-Jobs-are-Womens-Jobs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of the jobs</a> that typically pay less than $10 an hour. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-women-essential-workers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One in three jobs held by women</a> were deemed essential during the pandemic. And women, no matter their income level, were often left with <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/women-work-and-family-during-covid-19-findings-from-the-kff-womens-health-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest share of caregiving duties</a> — whether it was taking care of elderly parents, children whose schools and daycares were shut down or, in many cases, both.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/upshot/pandemic-working-mothers-jobs.html?te=1&amp;nl=the-upshot&amp;emc=edit_up_20220512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times found in a recent analysis</a>, many mothers have remained in the workforce despite the challenges. There was one exception to this, however: mothers living with children under the age of five. Among them, the share who were in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/upshot/pandemic-working-mothers-jobs.html?te=1&amp;nl=the-upshot&amp;emc=edit_up_20220512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workforce was down 4.2 percent</a> between March 2019 and March 2022, indicating how uneven the burdens of the pandemic have been. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The pandemic has been horrible, but there’s a couple of good things in terms of flexibility and women in the workplace. … [Low-paid women] haven’t been able to take advantage of any of that,” said Betsy Fischer Martin, executive director of the Women &amp; Politics Institute. “They have absorbed all of the regular negativity of the pandemic and had none of the upside to it.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1228421958-711.jpg" alt="A mother works from home while her son attends school remotely" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1228421958-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1228421958-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1228421958-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Many women have remained in or even joined the workforce during the pandemic. But for some, this has also meant balancing work with child care or care for elderly family members. <p>Jayme Gershen / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, those who are still working from home like it. In the beginning of the pandemic, most people who worked from home had to because their offices closed. But now, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a recent study by the Pew Research Center</a>, 76 percent of American workers whose workplace was open and who were mostly or totally working from home said that a major reason they were teleworking was because they preferred it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Women’s financial worries haven’t eased up, either. In the Women &amp; Politics Institute/Barbara Lee Family Foundation report, inflation was an important issue for female likely voters who made less than $50,000 a year. “In many cases, they are the primary earners and their home,” Fischer Martin said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Workers are seeking better circumstances and better pay as well. Ellis, the fitness director, said her workplace was still short-staffed and they’d had trouble hiring more people to fill the positions. Ellis herself is an hourly worker and spent the first part of the pandemic not working, worried that her employer wouldn’t cover her insurance while she wasn’t earning a paycheck. (They covered her.) She said the starting pay for instructors at her facility is $10 an hour.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When the gym reopened in fall 2020, its class offerings were reduced because management couldn’t find enough instructors, and she said it’s gotten even worse as some of the bankers and others who had been working from home for two years have begun to return to their downtown offices. “A lot of my members … want more hours,” she said. “They want more amenities.” They also want to go completely back to the way things were pre-pandemic, she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She tells them she wants to offer them more hours and classes, but that the gym is struggling to hire staff. “And then the response is, ‘Yeah, you know, people just don’t want to work nowadays,’” she said. She suspects they expect her to agree with them, but she doesn’t. “People want to work,” she said. “They just want to get paid fairly for the work.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For others, coming out of the pandemic will remain difficult because many key services haven’t returned to pre-pandemic levels. For example, the availability of child care remains about 12 percent lower than it was before 2020, according to Alycia Hardy, a senior policy analyst with The Center for Law and Social Policy. That reduction in supply can raise the cost of child care, which was already out of reach for many families in lower income brackets. Additionally, child care itself is often <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/child-care-workers-among-the-one-of-the-lowest-paid-occupations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a low-paying profession</a>, so many of the providers may be seeking work elsewhere for the reasons described by Ellis. “We’ve seen this devastation on this already fragile system,” Hardy says. “What that really translates into for families is that half a million families are without child care.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the women I spoke to had changed jobs or were planning to. Others had changed their relationship to work. But many also felt that people in their circumstances needed more support. In the Women &amp; Politics Institute/Barbara Lee Family Foundation report, a strong majority of women likely to vote in the 2022 midterms thought Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act should be expanded. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if Congress’s failure to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congress-found-an-easy-way-to-fix-child-poverty-then-it-walked-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extend the expanded child tax credit</a> — which <a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/montly-poverty-december-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have been keeping 3.7 million children out of poverty</a> — is any indication, we’re unlikely to see broad changes anytime soon.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Veronica, the bank teller, wants to make changes in her own life. Before the pandemic, she began working at the bank part-time so that she could take a course to become a court reporter and move into a better-paying field. But when the course shifted online, she felt she wasn’t able to learn as much as she had in the classroom. The extra burdens of her sick mother and homeschooled son made it untenable to balance her coursework and her job. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She wants to go back, though. She thinks it’s time for a career change. “It feels like I’m fighting for just $15 an hour,” she said. “It doesn’t feel fair, you know, after giving eight years to this place.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She said she thinks there are more people in her position — people who’ve had some college but haven’t finished, who know they have skills but feel they’re undervalued in the workplace and want more flexibility in their jobs. “I feel like a lot of people are in my position,” she said. “They want the same thing. They wanted to feel valued.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Has modern birth control made abortion a thing of the past? That’s what lawyers for the state of Mississippi want the U.S. Supreme Court to think. In a brief in the the pending case that could overturn abortion rights nationwide, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-1392/184703/20210722161332385_19-1392BriefForPetitioners.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi’s lawyers wrote</a>, “[E]ven if abortion may once have been thought critical as an alternative to contraception, changed circumstances undermine that view.” Access to birth control has improved, they noted, and some methods’ failure rates are “now approaching zero.” According to Mississippi’s lawyers, effective birth control means people don’t need abortions anymore.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Sarah, a professional living in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., did.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She asked us to withhold her full name for privacy reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> She had always wanted four children, but four was it. So after her fourth child was born, she and her husband researched birth-control options and landed on the one that seemed foolproof: a vasectomy. “We’re very thorough people, very by the book,” she said. “We wanted to make very, very sure we didn’t have an accident.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then, on Mother’s Day, Sarah found herself in her bathroom looking at two lines on a pregnancy test. She knew almost immediately that she was going to have an abortion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Statistically, Sarah’s experience was very unlikely. There’s a reason why vasectomies are touted as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2721499/#:~:text=Vasectomy%20is%20one%20of%20the,pregnancy%2C%20adequate%20counseling%20is%20essential." target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most reliable forms of birth control</a>: They have <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/4423-vasectomy#:~:text=Vasectomy%20offers%20many%20advantages%20as,procedure%20that%20provides%20permanent%20contraception." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a failure rate</a> of less than 1 percent,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 0.0001 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> as opposed to something like condoms, which has a failure rate closer to 13 percent. But because a 1 percent chance isn’t zero, some vasectomies fail every year, just like every other form of birth control. As a result, thousands of Americans who took steps to avoid getting pregnant will seek an abortion anyway. A <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2018/about-half-us-abortion-patients-report-using-contraception-month-they-became" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from the Guttmacher Institute</a> found that about half of abortion patients used contraception in the month they became pregnant. Framing abortion as a procedure that can be avoided through personal responsibility doesn’t prevent abortions from happening, experts told us. Instead, it just places more blame on women. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans need better access to contraception. In countries where birth control is cheap or free and more easily available to more people, there are much lower rates of unintended pregnancy, said <a href="https://obgyn.uw.edu/faculty/emily-m-godfrey-md-mph-faafp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Emily Godfrey</a>, a professor of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington. The unintended pregnancy rate in the United States is <a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/3/e007151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 21 percent higher</a> than in the average Western country,<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-03-2022-first-ever-country-level-estimates-of-unintended-pregnancy-and-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;World Health Organization and Guttmacher Institute estimate&lt;/a&gt; that modeled average rates between 2015 and 2019 for 150 countries. The WHO paper included the U.S., Canada and 35 European countries in its calculations of the median country rate for Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>19</sup></a> where national insurance or other universal health care programs are common. Likewise, a large <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2016/us-unintended-pregnancy-rate-falls-30-year-low-declines-seen-almost-all-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop in unintended pregnancy rates in the U.S.</a> between 2008 and 2011 was <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2016/03/new-clarity-us-abortion-debate-steep-drop-unintended-pregnancy-driving-recent-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correlated to an increase in the use of long-term, reversible methods of birth control</a>, such as IUDs or implants, which have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/index.htm#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low failure rates</a>. And that large drop in unintended pregnancy rates has led to <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2019/09/us-abortion-rate-continues-drop-once-again-state-abortion-restrictions-are-not-main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer abortions</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s not the same as saying that using birth control eliminates the need for abortion, Godfrey said. Yes, Americans can choose from <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/minimum-contraceptive-coverage-requirements-clarified-by-hhs-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16 forms of birth control,</a> two types of emergency contraception or “morning-after pills,” and three methods of sterilization. But there are many reasons why she says access to abortion remains necessary. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The simplest and most inescapable reason is that birth control can — and does — fail. That’s true even of the most reliable methods of preventing pregnancy, such as IUDs, implants and sterilization. </p>

<p>Source: Guttmacher Institute</p>
</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">According to the Guttmacher Institute study cited in the chart above, about 51 percent of <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(18)30003-9/fulltext#secst0060" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion patients in 2014 reported using some type of birth control</a> in the month they got pregnant. The shares of patients in that study who reported using a long-lasting, high-efficacy birth-control method were low — far more respondents said they had used a condom in the month they got pregnant, which doesn’t necessarily mean, of course, that they were using one at the time they got pregnant. But small percentages still represent thousands of individuals. Just 0.8 percent of respondents said they’d been using an IUD in the month they got pregnant, but that 0.8 percent translated to an estimated 7,700 abortion patients that year. Even the 0.2 percent who said they’d used either sterilization or implants represented an estimated 1,600 and 1,800 people, respectively, who ended up needing access to abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the political rhetoric of abortion doesn’t reckon with that fact, said <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/christine.dehlendorf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Christine Dehlendorf</a>, a professor of family community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “The mantra of ‘safe, legal and rare’ is stigmatizing,” she said. “It’s saying [abortion is] a bad outcome you should be able to avoid, as opposed to a health care service you should be able to access.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as a result, people are getting the message that abortion is a purely preventable problem — something a person can avoid <em>if</em> they are responsible enough. Sarah’s story comes from a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-you-have-an-abortion-story-we-want-to-hear-from-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collection of experiences with abortion</a> that readers shared with FiveThirtyEight. Our database contains hundreds of entries, and a common, recurring theme is that people reported getting pregnant while using birth control — and then felt like <em>they</em> were the ones who had failed. Contributors said they had done everything right, yet they still felt responsible. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">User error does contribute to unintended pregnancy, Godfrey said. That’s especially relevant when you’re talking about methods like the birth-control pill, which has to be taken correctly every day, or physical methods like condoms, which rely on proper usage in the moment. But user error can’t be dismissed as sexual irresponsibility either, she added. It’s just normal human behavior. “There’s research showing, on average, people miss a pill or two each month. That’s <a href="https://www.nehi-us.org/writable/publication_files/file/pa_issue_brief_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not just birth control</a>, it’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068890/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all long-term pills</a> … depression, diabetes, everyone,” she said. “Nobody uses any medication perfectly for 25 years. It’s not possible.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over and over, contributors described struggling with the feeling that abortion should be something they needed only if they were victimized, young and uninformed, too poor to get birth control, or just too irresponsible to take it properly. The stigma wrapped up in that stereotype made Sarah feel uneasy about her decision, even though she knew it was the right choice for her. “Society tells you to feel bad, so therefore I felt bad,” she said. “But, ultimately, I realized that if you can’t control when you have an abortion, then you can’t control when you’re going to have children,” she added. “Because I did literally everything I could not to get pregnant.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And any attempt to frame abortion as preventable by birth control has to take into account the many reasons why people might not be able to get contraception — and even reasons why some might not <em>want</em> it. Not all sex is consensual, after all. And even for <a href="https://nwhn.org/much-different-kinds-birth-control-cost-without-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who can plan ahead</a>, birth control <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/birth-control/annual-cost-of-birth-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be expensive</a> — an IUD <a href="https://khn.org/news/contraceptives-birth-control-surprise-bills-women-shouldnt-get-a-bill-for-an-iud-but-sometimes-they-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can run upward of $2,000</a> by the time you include both the device and doctor’s fees, Godfrey said. Then there’s the fact that the forms of birth control least likely to fail are also the ones patients have the least control over. Some doctors have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/why-do-some-doctors-refuse-to-give-women-iuds/2017/10/12/ee1e881e-a3c9-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to give patients IUDs</a> they requested and, in other cases, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010782415301414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to take out</a> IUDs <a href="https://www.insider.com/people-pulling-out-their-iud-to-avoid-costs-doctor-refusal-2021-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patients no longer wanted</a>. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/opinion/iud-implants-contraception-poverty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black and Latino women are more likely</a> to be counseled to use IUDs and encouraged to limit family size, and more likely to be encouraged to use a [birth-control] method they don’t want,” Dehlendorf said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is, birth control might reduce the need for abortions — but it can’t make abortions go away. That’s because the need for abortion goes beyond the capabilities of birth control, Godfrey said. People can be <em>trying</em> to get pregnant and still end up in situations where they want an abortion. There will always be people who couldn’t get reliable birth control. There will always be people who can’t or don’t want to use specific kinds of birth control. And there will always be people whose birth control simply didn’t work. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (May 19, 2022, 10:04 a.m.):</strong> An earlier version of this article misstated the failure rate of condoms.
