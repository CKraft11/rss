<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Welcome to </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/voices-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Voices Of Color</em></strong></a><em>, a column that explores what’s on the minds of voters of color in this year’s midterm elections. Too often, media coverage focuses on the political preferences of white people with euphemisms like “</em><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/07/599573817/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-suburban-women-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>suburban women</em></a><em>” or “</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/1/10889138/coded-language-thug-bossy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>middle class</em></a><em>.” But in this column, we want to know what makes voters of color tick. </em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>We want to explore their views on politics, policy, the future of our democracy, our two-party system and everything in between. We hope that this column offers fresh perspectives from the minds of those whose political opinions are often overlooked </em><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>or assumed</em></a><em>. Because the midterm elections are officially behind us, this will be the last entry in the Voices of Color series for the foreseeable future. We hope you enjoyed reading!</em></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Lisa Ayala-Davis says she knew that the <a href="https://people.com/politics/why-midterm-polls-falsely-predicted-red-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls predicting</a> a red wave this year were mistaken. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I feel like I was the lone voice saying, ‘Democrats are not going to do as badly as the pundits are saying,’” Ayala-Davis, a 48-year-old Hispanic Democrat living in rural Georgia, told me. In fact, she was more shocked by Democrats’ perceived <em>underperformance </em>in certain states. “I was really surprised that [Republican] J.D. Vance won the U.S. Senate race in Ohio. I really thought [Democrat] Tim Ryan was going to pull it off.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis’s high hopes for the Democrats aside, it was a good year for her party. Although Republicans narrowly took control of the House of Representatives, Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skirted the sizable losses</a> that the president’s party tends to suffer in midterm races. Not only that, Democrats kept their Senate majority, even <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/democrats-pick-up-senate-seat-with-fetterman-win-over-oz-networks-01667974207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipping an additional Senate seat</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So with the 2022 cycle officially behind us, I wanted to close my Voices of Color column by checking in with five voters about how they’re processing the results — both in their home states and nationally. This year’s midterms left some voters, especially those who identified as Republicans, especially shocked. Mickey N., who asked us not to use his full name due to privacy concerns, compared Republican defeat to <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2014/10/the-history-of-lucys-pulling-the-football-away-from-charlie-brown-in-peanuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a shopworn metaphor</a> from Charlie Brown: Lucy pulling the football away from Charlie Brown’s foot just as he begins his kick, with Republicans, this time, left flat on their backs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Mitch McConnell had no plans, while Florida Sen. Rick Scott had a ‘comprehensive’ plan to tax half of America,” he said. “They just didn’t have a coherent message.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I also wanted to know how these voters of color are thinking ahead to the 2024 presidential election. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/politics/biden-trump-2024-poll/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a lot of the country</a>, my interviewees weren’t jazzed about a potential rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. But they still had draft boards of other candidates they’d like to see running for commander-in-chief. (I won’t spoil their answers, though. More on that lower down.) </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: What was the biggest factor motivating you to vote this year? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N. (26, Ohio, Hispanic, Republican): I think the two main driving factors behind my vote this year were the Jan. 6 insurrection and the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Republican Party’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis also made my life more difficult, as someone in the medical field. We had people who would come in and say they were being ‘forced’ to get the vaccine or falsely claim that there was a microchip in the vaccine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Liv Marshall (22, Oregon, Asian, independent): There were some personal things going on that factored into me casting a ballot this year. For one, I have family affiliated with Oregon’s state government, and they were very worried about the three-way governor’s race and how the splitting of the vote could potentially shake up the outcome. That was definitely a strong factor. Secondly, I was more motivated to vote — and generally more politically engaged — following the Supreme Court’s decision on Roe. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kyla Ross (33, Massachusetts, Black, Democrat): The overturning of Roe. That was very upsetting, especially because I’ve seen the positive effects of abortion access — particularly in Detroit, which is where I grew up. Even when I was like a teenager or in middle school, I know some people who had to get abortions. And I saw for myself that them making that decision and having access to abortions benefitted their lives greatly. I was also turned off by all of the extremist and hateful rhetoric coming from the Republican side and feel as though voting and donating are my way of mitigating those types of things.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Aditya Eachempati (61, Missouri, Asian, Republican): Certain policies or political factors may have influenced who I cast a ballot for, but not whether I actually vote. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lisa Ayala-Davis (48, Georgia, Hispanic, Democrat): I’m a regular voter. I mean, I’ve practically voted in every election I’ve been eligible for. The only year I didn’t vote was in 2000, but I was married to a soldier and living in Germany at the time, and I didn’t know about the process of requesting an absentee ballot. All of that is my long-winded way of saying that it doesn’t take a lot of motivation for me to go vote. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Which election result — or trend — surprised you the most?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: I’m amazed at how well Republicans performed in California and New York. The Lauren Boebert race in Colorado was interesting to watch, too. And, being a health care provider, I was also floored that some political prognosticators were ‘shocked’ to see that abortion access was a big issue to voters. I think polling vastly undershot that. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: Historically, I know the out-party is usually more successful in the first midterm election after a new party takes over the presidency. That said, I was definitely surprised that Republicans didn’t do better. I feel like I heard a lot of chatter about more fringe Republican candidates who ended up not doing as well as many people thought they would. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: As someone from Detroit, I knew that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was going to win. I think she’s a great governor and I understood why she handled the COVID-19 pandemic the way she did. I was surprised, though, that Democrats ended up flipping the state legislature, too. I wasn’t too shocked about much else. I knew that Democrats would keep the U.S. Senate, and I think certain political pundits underestimated the intelligence of voters in this country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: In Missouri? Nothing. But I didn’t think Whitmer would win as easily as she did. I’m also a bit surprised that Republicans picked up a few congressional seats in New York. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: How would you assess both Republican and Democratic performance this election cycle? Did one party exceed or fall short of your expectations? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: With everyone talking about a ‘red wave,’ I was pretty shocked at how badly Republicans whiffed it this year. Regarding Democrats, I’d say that the quality of their candidates exceeded my expectations. I was happy to see a lot more pragmatic Democrats running. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: Going off of my previous answer, I definitely think that Democrats performed better than I expected — while Republicans performed more poorly. Considering that the economy and inflation were consistently listed as top concerns for voters headed in the midterm elections, I’m really surprised that Democrats didn’t face more backlash over things like gas prices or high inflation rates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: I feel like Democrats could have had a stronger ground game in certain states. I also think that, sometimes, Democrats aren’t as vocal about their accomplishments and, as a result, their good deeds get muddled by all of the mess that’s constantly being spewed by the Republican Party. That’s one thing I appreciate about Republicans: Their messaging has been on point. For example, Trump isn’t even in office anymore and yet, somehow, I still know what he said on his social media platform yesterday. For better or worse, the party is very loud and vocal when it comes to telling voters their plans, and Democrats need to do a better job of taking them seriously.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: Even though Republicans fell short of my expectations, some reporting suggests that they actually did quite well in U.S. House races and won the national popular vote by 3 points. Democrats performed about as I expected they would, but I think they won more races than they should have, in part, because Republicans ran weak candidates against them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Did you only vote for your party’s candidates, or did you cross party lines for any candidates? If you did vote for any opposite-party candidates, can you elaborate on why?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: I voted a straight blue ticket this November. At the local level, there was a Republican state representative running whom I voted against because she didn’t believe in any exceptions for abortion. And I voted against Vance because of his stances on Ukraine. That said, if Vance’s beliefs were closer to that of outgoing Sen. Rob Portman, I would’ve <em>probably</em> voted for a Republican in that race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, in all honesty, I don’t think I can see myself voting for Republicans until they publicly condemn the Jan. 6 insurrection. In a way, I’m sort of voting for Democrats as a punishment to Republicans until they get back to their old values and cut out the more cancerous sects of the party. I did vote in the GOP primary this year, but I only supported moderate candidates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: I identify as an independent. I grew up in New Hampshire and feel like a lot of people there identify as independent, too, but my views definitely lean Democratic. That said, I did technically cross party lines and vote a straight blue ticket this year, but I still feel like the independent label encompasses my beliefs better. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: I did not. I voted for Democrats up and down the ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: I crossed party lines in Missouri’s U.S. Senate race and voted for [Democrat] Trudy Busch Valentine over [Republican] Eric Schmitt mainly because I don’t like Schmitt. I didn’t like that he was primarily funded by the finance industry and he didn’t seem to have a clear plan for what he wanted to do if elected. It just seemed like he wanted to file a bunch of lawsuits. To be clear, I didn’t think Valentine was a particularly strong candidate, either, but at least she wasn’t Schmitt. I also voted for the Democrats running for attorney general and secretary of state but supported Republicans in every other race here. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: The one Republican that I voted for is a personal friend who ran unopposed for county commissioner. But besides that, I did not cross party lines. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are you more or less optimistic about the country’s future following the 2022 midterm elections?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: I’m tentatively optimistic, but generally pessimistic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: I’m very, very cautiously optimistic because a lot of the more radical, or fringe, Republican candidates were not successful in their general election races. That makes me hopeful that the cycle of political polarization we’ve seen in the last few years will stop. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: I am more optimistic. Before the election, it was easy to get discouraged because it felt like every single person on TV was saying that there was going to be a ‘red wave’ or that Democrats were going to be embarrassed by the results. But then the election came about and over and over again it was proven that issues like abortion access and preserving democracy were important to voters this cycle. That makes me feel so vindicated and optimistic about our future. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What are you hoping the federal government can accomplish with a Republican House and Democratic Senate? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: If they accomplish anything, I’ll be shocked. I have no expectations for them to get anything done. Still, I’d like to see Congress tackle another big infrastructure bill. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: My reality pants are on, and they’re making me say that nothing meaningful will get done. Democrats might get more federal judges (blah, blah, blah), but as far as passing bills and stuff like that, I’m skeptical. That said, if House Democrats play their cards right and grab five or six Republicans they can negotiate with, then <em>maybe</em> Democrats — and Congress generally — will be able to pass stuff. If so, I hope they’re able to pass more progressive legislation on issues like health care, child care and education. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: I hope that Republicans can come up with solutions to decentralize things like education, energy and health care. But in general, I want Republicans to do what I like Republicans to do: Keep government small, and keep taxes lower. It’s unpopular to want to cut Social Security and Medicare, but I hope Congress will do that, too. Most of my concerns revolve around fiscal stuff because I think issues like abortion access can be dealt with through ballot initiatives at the state level. That was pretty effective in Kansas and Michigan. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: I’m hopeful that lawmakers will be able to work in a bipartisan fashion despite there being so few issues where there’s crossover support. Maybe something with immigration is possible? That’s another issue that I care about a lot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Of the two major political parties, which do you think is in a better position to govern headed into next year? Why?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: I would say that Democrats are in a better position to govern mainly because it seems like there’s a lot of political infighting among Republicans. I understand that there’s still a lot of debate regarding who’s going to be the next speaker of the House, and I think issues and divisions like that are definitely more prevalent in the Republican Party than the Democratic Party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: Neither. I think both parties are scattered across the cosmos. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: I think there will be a gridlock because the Republican House will make it its business to block anything that comes out of Democratic Senate and vice versa. The status quo will continue because everything will be blocked. I wouldn’t say either party is in a better position to govern; it’s going to be a tie, and things will probably stay the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: Obviously the Democrats. The fact that they hold the White House and Senate, I think, gives them a leg up. Republicans have a slightly bigger hurdle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: How are you feeling about the 2024 presidential contest? Why? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: It feels like there’s no clear path for either party to take at this point, and I can’t believe we’re already talking about this. I feel like I’m caught between a rock and a hard place because I can’t fathom Biden running again because of his age — but I also don’t know who else would run on the Democratic side. And then, among Republicans, I feel like Trump will be an automatic front-runner because I just don’t see the party rallying around someone else to challenge him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: We have too many elections. The 2022 midterms literally just ended, and we already have someone announcing that they’re running for president. For my own sick entertainment, I’d really like to see a race between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. But I don’t think I care to see Biden and Trump going at it again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: I think DeSantis is easily the strongest Republican presidential candidate — even if he’s not my favorite candidate per se. I don’t think Trump has much of a chance, but I think DeSantis would beat Biden. With all the senators up for reelection in 2024, Republicans have an advantage there, too; and if they stop nominating bad candidates, they should also keep the U.S. House. I’m pretty optimistic about the 2024 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: Like most of the country, I really don’t want to see a rematch of Biden versus Trump. That’s going to be so toxic. On the flip side, if DeSantis manages to get the nomination, I don’t think Biden is going to be able to beat him. The visual of an 80-something-year-old up against a 40-something-year-old will be hard to overcome. I think Biden has been a great president and has accomplished so much, so I don’t want to be ageist — but I am a realist. I guess, like every other Democrat, I’m just waiting for the next Barack Obama. I just don’t know who that person is. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Who would be on your dream presidential ticket in 2024?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mickey N.: Whitmer for president and Pennsylvania Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro for vice president. But Shapiro is a tentative pick because he just got elected to the governorship. If his track record tanks between now and Election Day, I’d pick someone else to replace him. But I like Whitmer because I think she’s great. She governed under a Republican legislature and managed to help flip both chambers blue. Whitmer and outgoing Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney [for vice president] could be an option, too. I just don’t want to see Trump in 2024 — or for him to be a factor in Republican politics anymore. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Marshall: I want Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to run. He’s a fellow independent, and, as a young person, I agree with a lot of his policies. That said, it’s hard to imagine him running in 2024, given his age. And I’m not sure who I would choose for the vice president slot, but ideally it’d be someone who’s more representative of the demographic blocs Bernie can’t necessarily reach. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ross: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or California Rep. Katie Porter for president and Newsom for vice president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eachempati: DeSantis is fine, but I’d also be OK with [outgoing] Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan or Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine — basically any strong Republican governor. In general, I have a bias toward governors versus senators because I think governors have strong executive skills that senators often lack. And honestly, I don’t think the vice-presidential pick matters too much.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ayala-Davis: I think about this stuff a lot because everybody says, ‘Well, if not Biden, who?’ And I know I’m going to sound like a closet television pundit, but the person who I think would be a really good candidate is U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel because he’s got such a good resume and he’s such a fighter. I know nobody’s thinking about him as a viable candidate, but I think whoever goes up against either Trump or DeSantis needs to be a fighter. But what do I know? </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2022, FiveThirtyEight’s visual journalists covered the midterm elections, the end of Roe v. Wade and sports stories ranging from the World Cup to changes in Major League Baseball’s pitch timing rules. Here are some of the most interesting — and weird and colorful and complicated — charts we made in the last 12 months.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>I don’t want to alarm anyone, but the first nominating contest of the 2024 Republican presidential primary is likely just about a year away, and one candidate — you may have heard of him — has already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-2024-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his campaign</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it’s no longer <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-way-too-early-2024-republican-presidential-primary-draft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way too early</a> for us to hold a fantasy-baseball-style draft of who we think the GOP will nominate! Everyone got their draft boards ready to go?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>Yeah, I just hope I’m not picking third or fourth. Kind of a clear top-two here, don’t you think?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter):<strong> </strong>Nobody better steal my picks! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f52a.png" alt="🔪"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/santul-nerkar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santul Nerkar</a>, editor):<strong> </strong>It’s a two-player draft! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f47b.png" alt="👻"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Hahaha</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>But I am very curious to see how things shake out after picks No. 1 and 2.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Best of luck to whoever gets pick No. 3!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, here are the rules. We are drafting the candidates we think are most likely to win the GOP <em>nomination</em> — regardless of their chances in the general election. As usual, we will do a <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍"> draft, where the person with the final selection in one round picks first in the next round. Now let me completely randomly choose the order for the first round …</p>



<ol><li>Santul</li><li>Alex</li><li>Nathaniel</li><li>Geoffrey</li></ol>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, Santul, looks like you have the first pick! And, for the first time in forever, you actually have an interesting choice here!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>[Cues up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtpIv2hBKw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA draft music</a> in my head]</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f941.png" alt="🥁"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f941.png" alt="🥁"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f941.png" alt="🥁"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To make things potentially <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> in the early going here, I’m going to go with someone <em>other</em> than former President Donald Trump, the face of the GOP for the last six-plus years. My pick is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar:</strong> My reasoning is fairly simple: Unlike in 2016, the last time the GOP primary had more than one viable candidate, it does appear that the GOP rank and file has coalesced around DeSantis as a non-Trump alternative. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ron-desantis-holds-early-lead-over-donald-trump-among-gop-primary-voters-wsj-poll-shows-11670989311?mod=hp_lead_pos6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poll</a> after <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/news-features/news/2022/12/13/00/53/suffolk-poll-shows-ron-desantis-significantly-outpolling-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> in the <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early going</a> has found that, while Republicans aren’t exactly abandoning the former president and Trumpism, they do seem enthused by the idea of a candidate who stands for many of the things Trump does — without being Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I think this is a super smart pick, Santul! But I wonder if DeSantis flops, in part because he’s not really known for his <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/01/16/trump-privately-slams-desantis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal appeal</a> in the same way that Trump is?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hmm … I guess now that I think about it, I’m not sure if that’ll help or hurt him. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f937-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♀️"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Let’s see what happens when DeSantis and Trump get on the debate stage together, but DeSantis is clearly the main alternative to Trump at this very early point. He’s attracted an unusually high level support in early polls for a governor who has never run nationally before. You don’t <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-more-than-40-years-of-early-primary-polls-tell-us-about-2020-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often see someone</a> like that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-more-than-40-years-of-early-primary-polls-tell-us-about-2020-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hitting 30 percent</a> in national polls this early.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Yeah, that’s kind of where I’m at. He already enjoys <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/favorable_ron_desantis?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high favorability ratings</a> among GOP voters, despite never having run a national campaign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>So this is obviously a very voguish pick right now, with DeSantis leading <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several early primary polls</a>, but I personally think Trump is still the more likely nominee. Take a closer look at the polls that show DeSantis ahead: They’re almost <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/13/trump-support-gop-2024-presidential-race-poll/10882346002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ron-desantis-holds-early-lead-over-donald-trump-among-gop-primary-voters-wsj-poll-shows-11670989311?mod=hp_lead_pos5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head-to-head</a> <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-de-santis-surges-to-5-point-lead-over-weakened-trump-in-2024-primary-matchup-100022596.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> between <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MLSPSC11PressRelease_NationalIssues.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">him</a> and <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a>. But I’m skeptical that the GOP primaries will actually be head-to-head races. Plenty of other candidates have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/06/hogan-president-new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/asa-hutchinson-arkansas-presidential-bid-2024-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interest</a> in <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3679041-chris-christie-on-whether-hes-considering-a-2024-presidential-bid-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running</a>, and it’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy: If Trump looks weak enough to beat, that will encourage more candidates to jump into the race, which in turn increases the odds that Trump wins. Because when you look at <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/a-new-session-of-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between</a> <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-de-santis-surges-to-5-point-lead-over-weakened-trump-in-2024-primary-matchup-100022596.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.big-village.com/big-village/2022/12/Big-Village-Politics-Poll-12.02.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeSantis</a>, and a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/2zebcvjoec/econtoplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handful</a> of <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000184-a2ea-d1d1-ad8d-affbe2e40000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other</a> <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/national-poll-bidens-approval-remains-underwater-as-majority-of-gop-voters-support-trump-as-republican-nominee-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans</a>, Trump is usually ahead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Geoffrey alluded to, I also don’t think DeSantis is fully vetted yet. I think he’s become a bit of an avatar for folks who want to move beyond Trump, but what if he’s not a good debater, or has skeletons in the closet?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, although I’m like 90 percent sure that DeSantis will run, he’s not actually in the race yet. Trump is. That counts for something.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>If only you had the No. 2 pick, Nathaniel! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Nathaniel, I do think that’s right, in the sense that people don’t think about the actual rules of the GOP primary. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/primaries/explaining-the-presidential-primary-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most primaries and caucuses</a> on the Republican side are “winner-take-all” — or at least “winner-take-most” — meaning that all a candidate has to do is finish first in a state in order to win all or most of its delegates. Trump won in 2016 in part because <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/26/trump-election-2024-presidency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he won pluralities</a> in those races against a crowded field and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/timeline.php?year=2016&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">captured most of the delegates</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Exactly. We could see a repeat of 2016 where a divided field allows Trump to rack up delegates with like 40 percent of the vote in each state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We know a solid chunk of the Republican electorate is loyal to him. And they don’t have to constitute a majority of the party for him to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, I’m not sure DeSantis’s lead in head-to-head polls will last. I feel like we’re in a particular moment where Republicans are unhappy with Trump because candidates aligned with him <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/15/data-trump-weighed-down-republican-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did so poorly in the midterms</a>. But there have been past moments where it seemed like the GOP could be poised to abandon Trump — e.g., a lot of Republican politicians criticized him after the Jan. 6 riot — but then they closed ranks around him again. What do you guys think?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I personally don’t think this will last. Trump isn’t really in the public eye right now, and we’re still a ways away from 2024. I think there’s plenty of time for current members of the party who aren’t over the moon about his presidential announcement to warm to him. Plus, as Nathaniel said before, DeSantis could struggle and Trump could become the GOP’s only viable option. Or, DeSantis could sit this one out because Trump already threw his hat in the ring.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Eh, I think DeSantis running is all but certain. He’s just likely <a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/politics/ron-desantis-presidential-run/67-30b16938-a528-4e04-a1b4-06bb1c52c428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going to wait</a> until the end of Florida’s legislative session in the spring before officially launching his campaign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I personally disagree, but that’s what chats are for!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Man, I’m already feeling buyer’s remorse for my pick!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Alex, it sounds like you have a name in mind for pick No. 2, then??</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I do, Nathaniel! I’d be a fool if I didn’t pick Trump No. 2! In short, the GOP currently is still largely the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/us/politics/trump-2024-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party of Trump</a>. Yes, there were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/14/republicans-trump-2024-00066874" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few grumbles</a> from fellow Republicans about his 2024 run, but most prominent leaders in the party have been <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/04/republicans-mostly-silent-trump-call-suspend-constitution/10832850002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely silent</a> over some of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-rebuked-for-call-to-terminate-constitution-over-2020-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his most</a> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/11/donald-trump-nick-fuentes-kanye-west-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent controversies</a>. This all suggests to me that Republican lawmakers continue to feel uneasy challenging the former president because they know they still need his base to win elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, even though our average of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s favorability rating</a> among all Americans is at an all-time low, another poll from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a>, which was released in November, found that when offered a choice between Trump, DeSantis or “someone else,” Republican voters were evenly split over who they prefer win the GOP presidential nomination (44 percent preferred DeSantis; 44 percent backed Trump; 11 percent didn’t offer an opinion). And, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-can-the-2022-midterms-tell-us-about-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve discussed before</a>, there are plenty of examples of Republicans appearing to break with Trump — only to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/06/nikki-haley-biggest-gop-flip-flops-trump-post-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall back in line later</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I think you got good value with Trump at No. 2, Alex (obviously, considering my DeSantis skepticism).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Trump could still definitely win the nomination. It’s been easy to say “DeSantis this, DeSantis that,” but he’s untested. A lot of Republicans still falsely believe Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/poll-61-republicans-still-believe-biden-didnt-win-fair-square-2020-rcna49630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost illegitimately in 2020</a>, and his favorability among Republicans <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remains high</a>, although it has gone down a little since the 2022 elections. But there’s no question the opportunity is there for Trump to win a comeback campaign.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>One thing that Trump has this cycle that he didn’t have in 2016 is a lot of elite support. Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville has <a href="https://www.al.com/politics/2022/11/the-leader-america-needs-tommy-tuberville-endorses-donald-trumps-2024-presidential-campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a>, along with <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/republican-reaction-to-trump-a-few-endorsements-and-a-lot-of-crickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several House members</a>. There’s been a lot of talk about how many Republican members of Congress <em>haven’t</em> endorsed him yet (probably because they are worried he’s electoral poison), but not as much about all the support that he does have. And <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-tracking-2020-presidential-endorsements-heres-why-they-probably-still-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elite support can matter</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>To play devil’s advocate to my own DeSantis pick, it’s also still very early. Around this time eight years ago — during the cycle Trump would eventually run in and win — none other than Jeb! Bush was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/28/politics/bush-leads-gop-field-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading in GOP polls</a>. So while the field appears to be more clearly defined this time around, at this point in the cycle, the fact that DeSantis leads Trump in some early polls isn’t a guarantee of anything.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>As I alluded to earlier, I do think Trump’s candidacy will clear the field of all other serious candidates (other than, perhaps, an anti-Trump candidate or two). But it seems pretty clear to me that Republicans are scared to go up against Trump lest his loyal followers turn on them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just ask the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/16/us/politics/liz-cheney-impeachment-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 House Republicans</a> who voted in favor of his impeachment! Only <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/members-gops-impeachment-10-survived-backlash-rcna58324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two will be returning to Congress</a> next year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>It is true, however, that DeSantis gives Republicans who don’t want Trump a better opportunity to coordinate and rally to one candidate. Anti-Trump Republicans <a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2016/5/19/11712612/republican-elites-coordination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced a coordination problem</a> in 2016, as there were a bunch of GOP alternatives, no one was sure how seriously to take Trump at first, and they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/opinion/campaign-stops/why-cant-the-gop-stop-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couldn’t coalesce around one candidate</a> when it became abundantly clear Trump was the front-runner for the nomination. Once the voting got going, the alternatives eventually became Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, which also worked out well for Trump because there were parts of each candidate’s constituency <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/2016-republican-poll-trump-cruz-kasich-221111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who might’ve backed Trump</a> before the other non-Trump candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Republicans have also either lost ground or underperformed in three consecutive election cycles, and Trump’s favorability seems to be slipping relative to DeSantis’s. So I think voters could view DeSantis as a fresher, more “electable” face than they view Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, there was a <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/news-features/news/2022/12/13/00/53/suffolk-poll-shows-ron-desantis-significantly-outpolling-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University/USA Today poll</a> the other day that asked about two hypothetical general elections: In one, President Biden beat Trump 47 percent to 40 percent among all voters, but in the other, DeSantis beat Biden 47 percent to 43 percent. Of course, it’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way too early</a> to put much stock in general-election polls, but polls like that may nevertheless create a narrative.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, DeSantis would be wise to push the electability argument along with his Trump-ish approach on issues. “Look, I just won the swing state of Florida by almost 20 points, I’m polling better than Trump against Biden and I’m pushing the issues you care about, GOP primary voters.” That’s a pretty lethal combination — potentially anyway.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I’m just not convinced that Republicans care as much about electability, though. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-care-more-about-winning-than-usual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poll after poll</a> in the 2020 presidential primaries showed that <em>Democrats</em> really prioritized it when picking their nominee, but if recent GOP primaries are any indication, Republicans care more about ideological purity.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Sure, Nathaniel, but I don’t think it’s a coincidence that DeSantis seems to be <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing better in polls</a> that have narrower sample populations — his margins versus Trump are superior in surveys of registered voters compared with ones of adults, or among likely voters compared with registered voters. This suggests that more engaged voters, who <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/political-engagement-among-typology-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to also be more ideological</a>, are more likely to prefer him. That could be due to both electability (“Trump might lose, let’s find someone else”) and ideology.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I must ask … What is the difference between a DeSantis voter and a Trump voter? I don’t think they’d push vastly different policies if elected, so what’s really differentiating the two besides maybe personality? I also don’t get the vibe that anti-Trump Republicans would suddenly be gung-ho about returning to the party with DeSantis at the helm.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>It’s interesting you mention that, Alex. I’ll emphasize again that we should take  these early polls with a gigantic helping of salt, but the Suffolk University/USA Today poll Nathaniel mentioned found that DeSantis actually leads Trump among voters who identified as “conservative” or “very conservative.” It’s pretty remarkable that DeSantis has emerged as the most viable potential Trump challenger, not by positioning himself as a never-Trumper, but rather by leaning into a lot of the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-com-lantigua-asian-americans-coronavirus-hate-attacks-20200407-rk7nak2jlbautmnzfd2c2uvbnq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rhetoric</a> and <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2021/12/10/governor-ron-desantis-announces-proposals-to-stop-the-flow-of-illegal-aliens-and-protect-floridians-from-the-ongoing-biden-border-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy positions</a> that made Trump who he is.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Alex, that they would attract many of the same voters seems like a feature, not a bug, for DeSantis. As Santul said, he’s a fresh face who can bring much of the same approach but in a more electorally appealing form. I’m not sure it’s so much about electability on its own, but DeSantis can offer a combination of electoral success with <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2021/09/02/florida-desantis-5000-fines-requiring-proof-vaccination-vaccine-passport/5694871001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy successes</a> as Florida’s governor <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-dont-say-gay-law-signed-56aee61f075a12663f25990c7b31624d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that conservatives find appealing</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I guess, since they’re very similar, it’s <em>possible</em> that Republican elites end up unhappy with both candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if Trump is truly a weakened candidate — so much so that DeSantis decides to challenge him — then I don’t think the Florida governor will be the only Republican taking on the former president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Speaking of other potential candidates … With the third pick of the draft, I’m going to choose Ted Cruz. This is a bit of a bank shot: In those polls of Trump, DeSantis, and several other Republicans, Cruz isn’t polling in third; he usually <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/2zebcvjoec/econtoplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clocks</a> only <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2-3 percent</a> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.big-village.com/big-village/2022/12/Big-Village-Politics-Poll-12.02.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationally</a>. But in a world where DeSantis doesn’t run for some reason, I think Cruz is the most natural not-Trump Trumpist candidate. He’s well known in the party thanks to his 2016 presidential campaign, in which he finished second — and, historically, Republicans like to nominate the “next candidate in line.” Think John McCain in 2008 after he finished second to George W. Bush in 2000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Whoa, hello.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Wowwww.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Nathaniel, you REALLY want a Cruz 2024 run, don’t you? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Readers, this is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-way-too-early-2024-republican-presidential-primary-draft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not the first time</a> Nathaniel has selected Cruz as his first-round pick! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I’m nothing if not consistent!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>This pick is certainly reasonable to me if the goal is to pick someone who is most likely to be the GOP nominee. Cruz wants the job and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essentially finished second</a> in 2016, which to Nathaniel’s point has historically been a pathway to future success <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-modern-history-of-the-republican-presidential-primary-1976-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Republican nomination contests</a>. Besides McCain, there are Ronald Reagan (ran in 1976, won in 1980), George H.W. Bush (ran in 1980, won in 1988) and Bob Dole (ran in 1988, won in 1996).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after initially pushing back against Trump — remember his <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/rnc-2016-donald-trump-unity-225915" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 convention speech</a>? — Cruz <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/08/ted-cruz-convention-speech-donald-trump-non-endorsement-spark-blowback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught a lot of flak</a> and then <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/22/659692611/from-lyin-ted-to-beautiful-how-trump-and-cruz-found-political-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became strongly supportive</a> of Trump. So I think Cruz is less likely to run if Trump remains in the field.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, he’s in a tricky spot. He was kind of outflanked by DeSantis in the “position yourself to run against Trump but don’t be anti-Trump” invisible primary. Now his best bet might be rooting for Trump in this primary, then running himself in 2028.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Nathaniel, I’ll ask you now what I asked you back in March 2021: How can Cruz win considering <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ted-cruz-senator-paris-climate-b1790835.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how disliked he is</a> in GOP circles? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Haha, Alex, I’ll tell you what I told you then too: Among GOP voters, Cruz isn’t disliked! According to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Morning Consult poll</a>, 61 percent of potential Republican primary voters had a favorable opinion of him, while only 20 percent had an unfavorable opinion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>But he barely won his own Senate race in 2018 against former Rep. Beto O’Rourke! In fact, his approval rating is <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/ted-cruz-job-approval-trend-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still underwater</a> in his home state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I’m surprised by this pick because — like you said, Nathaniel — Cruz probably isn’t entering a race that Trump is already in, he’s not a more moderate alternative to Trump, and there’s already a strong conservative challenger to Trump right now in DeSantis. So Cruz doesn’t check the box of a never-Trumper, nor is he the most obvious right-wing alternative to the former president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I mean, look. Like we said at the beginning, I’m not sure anyone other than Trump or DeSantis has more than, like, a 10 percent chance of winning the nomination. But I think Cruz is more likely than a certain former vice president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Speaking of which … Geoffrey, your turn.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I get not one but two picks here back to back. So with the first one, I’m going to take the straightforward pick of former Vice President Mike Pence. No, I don’t think it’s especially likely that he wins the nomination, but he’s a former vice president, and that’s been a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-offices-are-good-stepping-stones-to-the-presidency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty surefire way</a> to get yourself close to winning in past primaries. He maintains at least some support <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/us/politics/mike-pence-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the donor class</a> and has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/22/mike-pence-2024-staff-00070579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making moves</a> that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-south-carolina-mulling-presidential-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portend a presidential bid</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yes, he is the candidate I alluded to earlier who’s consistently polling in third place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Albeit usually around 7-8 percent of the vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Hm, I wonder if he’s consistently polling third due largely to name recognition?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I think that’s part of it, Alex. And as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey wrote back in 2019</a>, having high name recognition but low polling numbers is not a good place to be.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Mike Pence is the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">De’Andre Hunter</a> of this two-player draft.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But yeah, I think that’s decent value for a No. 4 pick. In the unlikely scenario that Trump drops out — perhaps because of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/donald-trump-investigations-lawsuits/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">host of legal troubles</a> he’s facing right now — I think Pence’s chances go up significantly, especially next to a comparatively untested figure like DeSantis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Hey, the Virginia grad here says <a href="https://youtu.be/TtUeDFtK-xA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respect De’Andre</a>. But comparisons aside, that’s my attitude, too, Santul. Pence is there, he’s going to be able to put together a credible campaign, and who knows how DeSantis and Trump work out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Anyway, to kick off the second round with my next pick, I’m going to go with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Strong Texan representation here!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>… Do you and Nathaniel know something about Texas that I don’t?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>It’s a great factory for Republican politicians! It has produced <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-have-produced-the-most-presidential-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two recent(ish) GOP presidents</a>, and it’s obviously the largest red state. In other words, there’s a deep bench of Republican candidates there, and the ones who rise to the top are inevitably talented politicians.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I do think <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/11/14/texas-voters-ron-desantis-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this poll</a> — in which Republican voters in the Lone Star State said they preferred DeSantis over Trump by more than 10 percentage points — is telling, though. And, perhaps most notably, the survey didn’t ask about either Cruz or Abbott. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I don’t know that Abbott will run (in fact, Cruz is <a href="https://www.kut.org/texasstandard/2022-12-13/will-greg-abbott-run-for-president" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably more likely to run</a> than Abbott). But what I do know is that the man can <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/18/greg-abbott-texas-fundraising-governor-donors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise a ton of money</a> and that he has a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-governor-moves-state-sharply-right-ahead-2022-election-2021-10-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative track record</a> that would surely appeal in a primary. If we’re talking about people who could actually win a long primary campaign, Abbott has much more potential than many of the other names on my list. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Simply put, a lot of names out there are VP material. And Abbott is not one of them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Wait, he’s <em>not</em> VP material? Why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I don’t think he’d take it. Dude is the governor of Texas. President or bust.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What I’m saying is that some other potential candidates we could name are people who would happily take the VP job and would be running for president with an eye on that in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, I’m up next, and I’m going with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. He’s a rising star within the party (he had a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/25/21400661/tim-scott-rnc-speech-republican-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prime speaking slot</a> at the 2020 Republican National Convention), and he’s managed the extremely impressive feat of staying on the good side of both the Trumpist and non-Trumpist wings of the party. That might be difficult to maintain if he, uh, runs for president against Trump, but I think he might be a better politician than DeSantis and could fill that “fresh face” role nicely if DeSantis stumbles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Smart pick! I was semi-surprised his win on Election Day wasn’t more of a conversation-starter. It seemed like all eyes were on DeSantis’s performance, but Scott racked up an even more decisive win — defeating his opponent by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-south-carolina-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 points</a>. Yes, I know South Carolina is redder than Florida and Democrats never seriously targeted it, but still!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, I seriously considered picking Scott earlier. He had a very strong midterm performance, got rave reviews for his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/24/trump-republican-national-convention-day1-401134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 convention speech</a> and may be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/12/trump-gop-senators-tim-scott-presidential-00073280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering a run</a>.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>For all the chatter about Republicans wanting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congress-will-have-the-most-black-republicans-in-over-a-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a more diverse voting base</a>, I wonder if Scott offers a broader appeal as a Black man?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, Alex, I think nominating a Black man would be appealing to a lot of Republican voters who want to defuse Democratic attacks that the party is racist.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, we’re starting to run out of time, so we’re going to have to make this the last round! Alex, who’s your second and final pick?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I appreciate you all for not stealing my No. 7 pick: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In his 2021 campaign, Youngkin ran with the image of an inoffensive suburban dad and businessman. He kept Trump out of the state and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/glenn-youngkin-wont-participate-in-trumps-tele-rally-for-virginia-gubernatorial-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t appear with him</a> at the tele-town hall event Trump hosted right before the election — <em>but</em> Youngkin was smart in that he also played into some of the same issues Trump voters care about. (He even falsely claimed that the Department of Justice was trying to “<a href="https://vpm.org/news/articles/26201/politifact-va-youngkins-claim-that-mcauliffe-asked-the-fbi-to-go-after-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silence parents</a>.”) So Youngkin did everything he could to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-glenn-youngkin-kept-trump-at-arms-length-but-on-his-side-11636057542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk that line</a> — not to look or sound like Trump, while also not offending his base and still accepting Trump’s endorsement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, at least so far, tying Youngkin to Trump hasn’t been a death knell for his candidacy and political aspirations. According to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/29/virginia-governors-race-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post-Schar School poll</a> that came out a few days before the election, a majority of voters (roughly 7 in 10) thought Youngkin’s ideas and policies were similar to Trump. He won anyway. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Youngkin might want to do what former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie <em>didn’t</em> do in 2012 and start running for president roughly a year and a half into his gubernatorial term. When the iron is hot, you gotta strike. If you wait, you might find yourself suddenly more unpopular or facing a scandal or something that weakens your chances in a presidential primary, <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/chris-christie-sinking-213284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as happened with Christie</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, Alex, he could make an electability argument too: He won the governorship of Virginia by 2 points just one year after Biden carried the state by 10.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Youngkin also made <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-election-ap-votecast-survey-75520c5c9a245bee384526abc138a61a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key inroads with groups like Latino voters</a> in that 2021 gubernatorial election, suggesting he could put together a relatively more diverse coalition than other contenders.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> At the same time, though, I feel like Youngkin could be too boring/establishment for GOP primary voters. They want a fighter, not <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20211106/who-wears-the-power-sweater-vest-better-democrats-or-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweater vests</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I, personally, want to see more politicians in sweater vests, Nathaniel.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Haha.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All right, Santul, bring us home with the last pick!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f630.png" alt="😰"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Mike Pompeo is <a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/political-news/2022-03-12/former-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-makes-another-trip-to-iowa-raising-2024-speculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking for your vote</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>And he shall not get it!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>No one has picked the only Republican (other than Trump) who is actually running for president so far: former Montana Secretary of State <a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/former-mt-secretary-of-state-announces-presidential-bid/article_7126a007-089a-5392-8390-f197d41fddb1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corey Stapleton</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Stapleton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Stapleton</a> might have better odds than Corey.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For my second and final pick, I’m going with another South Carolinian: former Gov. and Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver made the point when we did our last GOP primary draft, all the way back in 2021, that Republicans might very well be tempted to back a “safer” candidate like Haley if the party suffered a worse-than-expected 2022 midterm performance because Trumpy candidates lost winnable races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Well, that scenario has now come to pass, and Republicans might find themselves having to make such a decision. If voters are too turned off by Trump’s baggage and DeSantis has a bad debate or two in the early going, I could see the GOP rank and file potentially coalescing around a different candidate. And Haley has the <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/haley-touts-new-anti-abortion-law-holds-ceremonial-second-signing/article_4e4f8d8f-9e99-5318-bd34-977c1dfa1bf0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkihaley/status/1396975960122171396?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bona fides</a>, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/ratings/politics/popularity/Republicans/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">name recognition</a> and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorability among her own party</a> to give her a fighting chance in such an environment. (Also, how many times is she going to be named as a potential candidate before actually running?)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Haley did recently backtrack on her previous promise not to run if Trump did. She’s reportedly going to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nikki-haley-says-will-decide-2024-presidential-run-over-holidays" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take the holidays to consider</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Everything Haley has done points toward a run. After <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/23/last-month-nikki-haley-was-not-a-fan-of-donald-trump-now-shes-agreed-to-join-his-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticizing Trump in 2016</a>, she joined his administration as U.N. Ambassador <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/us/politics/nikki-haley-united-nations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to amp up her foreign affairs profile</a> on top of her governing experience. So she certainly has the resume.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Interesting choice! Haley <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nikki-haley-tops-off-flood-national-gop-support-herschel-walker-rips-arrogant-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned with</a> Trump-backed U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker in Georgia ahead of the December runoff election, so I’m wondering if that says anything about her being team Trump?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I actually think she is the opposite of Scott in that she has managed to get on the <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2021/magazine-nikki-haleys-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>bad</em> side</a> of both the Trumpist and non-Trumpist wings of the party. As you said, Alex, she has mostly aligned herself with Trump since joining his administration, but she was one of the Republicans who criticized him after Jan. 6 only to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/06/nikki-haley-biggest-gop-flip-flops-trump-post-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk it back later</a>. But I’m not sure voters — or Trump — have forgotten.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I also think sexism will hold her back. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0022-3816.00019?casa_token=_5SuMi1bdxsAAAAA%3Arer1hAN9R5G1EgsC8F2MI7vYOjRmbAEPXY1asoPxpAysgMB-i-k7s6jG6V5cmVjROTRlqFdvs5oLQw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research shows</a> that female Republican candidates are perceived as more moderate, and moderate historically hasn’t been what GOP primary voters are looking for.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>That perception has played out in really ugly ways, too, Nathaniel. Haley faced backlash from her own party in 2015 for signing a bill to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House after a white supremacist murdered nine people at a Black church in Charleston, and she’s since walked that back, saying that the perpetrator “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/nikki-haley-confederate-flag/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hijacked”</a> the Confederate flag.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Interesting that Haley was the only woman we selected in this draft. I think our draft <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-way-too-early-2024-republican-presidential-primary-draft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2021</a> was slightly more diverse (though that one also went to four rounds). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I’m sorry we didn’t have time for more rounds, readers! We didn’t give <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/asa-hutchinson-arkansas-presidential-bid-2024-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asa Hutchinson</a>, <a href="https://www.concordmonitor.com/On-the-trail-48861211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Sununu</a>, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-hogan-fundraiser-113022-20221130-r57upthc55d3bpiowmp5e5snzq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larry Hogan</a>, <a href="https://listen.sdpb.org/politics/2022-07-29/noem-not-ruling-out-a-run-for-president" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristi Noem</a> or <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/05/bolton-trump-potus-2024-00072436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Bolton</a> their moment in the sun. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Coming into the 2022 midterm elections, the Democratic Party wasn’t sure what to do with its standard-bearer. With <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his poor approval rating</a>, President Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/democratic-candidates-are-hesitant-campaign-biden-recent-win-streak-rcna45339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t a hot commodity</a> on the campaign trail, as Democrats — facing an electoral environment that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history suggested</a> would be unfavorable — <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/why-republican-insiders-think-the-gop-is-poised-for-a-blowout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feared losing both chambers</a> of Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after all the votes were tallied, Democrats retained control of the Senate by winning the chamber’s four most important races, holding onto seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada and picking up an open seat in Pennsylvania. The candidates who won these races didn’t do so by remaking the Democratic coalition in their states. In fact, county-level data suggests that their performances mostly tracked along Biden’s performance in the 2020 presidential election, which saw him <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/data.php?year=2020&amp;datatype=national&amp;def=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carry all four states by narrow margins</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"> Where these Democratic candidates <em>did</em> gain ground suggests that they largely replicated Biden’s coalition while also making some small but specific inroads. In Pennsylvania counties with lots of white voters without a college degree, in some heavily Hispanic parts of Arizona, in the Atlanta metropolitan area in Georgia — Democrats won Senate seats by exceeding the margins Biden used to win each state in 2020. And even in Nevada, where Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s margin of victory was smaller than Biden’s, her performance in more affluent areas with larger numbers of white voters with a college degree suggests that she made up enough ground to offset her slightly smaller margins in lower-turnout and more racially diverse areas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To examine how these various trends played out in each state, we took a look at the county-level results and how the Democratic winners’ margins compared to Biden’s in 2020. We also dug into how these changes related to demographic and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic data in this piece is from the five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017-2021 American Community Survey, the most recent numbers available. Throughout this article, “white” refers to the non-Hispanic white population and “Black” refers to the non-Hispanic Black population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> County-level data <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t always provide a clear picture</a> of how different groups voted, so we also spent some time looking beneath the county level — at congressional district- or precinct-level results — to explore some of the key factors that propelled Democrats to victory.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>



<div>
<section>Out of this quartet, the one Democratic pickup was the open seat in Pennsylvania, which saw a striking reversion of a recent trend in American elections: white voters without a college degree increasingly opting for Republican candidates. Indeed, while Democratic Sen.-elect John Fetterman bettered Biden’s margin across almost the entire state on his way to defeating Republican Mehmet Oz by about 5 percentage points, his largest improvements over Biden tended to be in red-leaning counties with higher shares of white residents without a college degree, as the chart below shows.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two variables had a reasonably strong &lt;a href="https://www.jmp.com/en_us/statistics-knowledge-portal/what-is-correlation.html"&gt;correlation&lt;/a&gt; of 0.572. White residents without a college degree refers to the population age 25 or older that is non-Hispanic white and does not have a bachelor’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a></section><br>

<p data-paragraph="main">This pattern proved vital to the result because white voters without a college degree make up a big chunk of the Keystone State’s electorate. Three in four Pennsylvanians are white, putting the state in the top half of the whitest states in the country, and almost two in three of them do not have a bachelor’s degree. Former President Trump <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clintons-ground-game-didnt-cost-her-the-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the state in 2016</a>, in part due to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gains among voters</a> in this group, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came just shy</a> of defeating Biden there in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Fetterman’s improvement wasn’t an accident, as his campaign <a href="https://time.com/6175747/john-fetterman-pennsylvania-senate-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent a lot of time</a> and effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/us/politics/fetterman-pennsylvania-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appealing to blue-collar white voters</a> in places where Democrats <a href="https://www.ydr.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/05/heres-why-democrat-john-fetterman-is-touring-in-red-pa-counties/65347627007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have lost ground</a> in recent years. In counties with a population that’s at least 60 percent white without a college degree — which together produced about 36 percent of the state’s 2022 vote — Fetterman’s margin was 7 points better than Biden’s, on average, compared with just 3 points better elsewhere. It’s hard to know how much Oz’s profile as a Hollywood-connected television celebrity also played into these results. Fact is, Oz may have been an especially weak candidate <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/politics/pennsylvania-senate-election-oz-rural-voters/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when it came to appealing</a> to less affluent voters in more rural areas, where Fetterman made some of his most sizable gains compared to Biden. But overall, Fetterman’s improvement in farther-flung places mattered because it reduced the GOP’s ability to run up massive margins outside the state’s two major metropolitan areas, which Republicans need in order to have a path to victory in Pennsylvania.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This focus coupled successfully with Fetterman’s profile as a <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/10/love-him-or-not-john-fetterman-has-left-his-mark-on-his-adopted-hometown-of-braddock.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former mayor of a struggling post-industrial town</a> in the Pittsburgh area, which produced especially strong results for Fetterman in the western part of the state. Not only is western Pennsylvania whiter than the eastern part of the state, but parts beyond Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) <a href="https://www.politicspa.com/acela-vs-appalachia-pa-presidential-results-since-1976/69489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were once more Democratic-leaning</a> before becoming much redder in recent years. Thanks to his campaign and background, Fetterman’s margin was 8.5 points better than Biden’s across the entire Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area, including double-digit overperformances in some of the area’s more peripheral and red-leaning counties.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bulletin-20-01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area includes&lt;/a&gt; Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> Now, Fetterman didn’t flip any of these counties, but he significantly reduced the Republican margin across most parts of the state’s western half. For instance, Greene County in the state’s southwest corner still went for Oz by 30 points, but Trump won it by 43 points in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, Fetterman’s winning performance didn’t necessarily involve massive engagement from every part of the Biden coalition. Fetterman ran about even with Biden’s 2020 showing in the larger Philadelphia metropolitan area, which was partly due to reduced turnout among Black voters. Philadelphia proper saw <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/upshot/midterms-election-black-turnout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notably lower participation compared with 2018</a>, the previous midterm, whereas the total number of votes cast was up almost everywhere else in the state. Nevertheless, Fetterman also did almost 5 points better than Biden in areas of the state outside of the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh metropolitan areas, showing the wide breadth of his outperformance.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Similar to Fetterman, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona won his race by holding together most of Biden’s coalition while also making small gains elsewhere. His 5-point victory over Republican Blake Masters came in part because he won a high level of support among Latino voters, a Democratic-leaning group that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-latinos-really-moved-toward-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted somewhat toward Republicans</a> in the 2020 presidential election — a trend the GOP had <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/latino-voters-stuck-democrats-southwest-2022-rcna58260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoped to build on in 2022</a>. As the chart below shows, Kelly improved on Biden’s margins most everywhere, but there was no relationship between the share of a county’s Latino population and how much Kelly outperformed Biden.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An almost nonexistent correlation of 0.013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> Take the two counties that have majority-Hispanic populations: Kelly performed 3 points better than Biden in Santa Cruz (which is 83 percent Hispanic) and ran about even with Biden in Yuma (65 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But about <a href="https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/State_Voter_Registration_2022_General.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-fourths of the state’s voters</a> live in Maricopa County (Phoenix) and Pima County (Tucson), so the topline numbers in those counties may not tell us much about the Latino vote specifically (the counties are 32 and 38 percent Latino, respectively). So we have to look <em>within</em> those counties to get a clearer understanding of how the state’s Latino population voted. For instance, in the Maricopa-based 3rd Congressional District — Arizona’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most heavily Latino seat</a> (58 percent by voting-age population) — Kelly did about 4 points better than Biden did in 2020, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JR48I4oPAM_mTfeu8-EryAb3G5t3r6JUzKVoL40nbv4/edit#gid=1352397398" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Daily Kos Elections</a>. This suggests that, at the very least, Kelly probably didn’t lose much — if any — ground among Latino voters.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This takeaway is confirmed by Equis Research, a Latino-focused political firm that compared their modeled race and ethnicity voter data to precinct-level results in Maricopa. Equis found that as the share of the Latino population in a precinct grew, Kelly’s performance <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosodio/status/1594735839833198593/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved at about the same rate</a> as Biden’s had in 2020. And across majority Latino precincts in Maricopa, <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosodio/status/1594736605633433602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equis calculated</a> that Kelly did about 1 point better than Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelly also made further inroads in competitive or red-leaning areas in Phoenix with larger white populations. Within Maricopa County, Kelly did 5 to 7 points better than Biden in the 1st, 4th, 5th and 8th congressional districts (all but the 5th are entirely in Maricopa). These districts vary quite a bit in terms of partisanship, too, as the 1st and 4th are both highly competitive and the 5th and 8th districts are both solidly red. Considering registered Republicans in Maricopa <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/upshot/georgia-voter-turnout-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned out at a slightly higher rate</a> than registered Democrats, Kelly’s performance suggests he may have won over some right-leaning (or formerly right-leaning) voters to outperform Biden’s 2020 showing.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"> Staying in the Southwest, Nevada also provided another key hold for Democrats in the Senate. Unlike the Democratic winners in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, Cortez Masto didn’t outperform Biden’s 2020 numbers statewide, but she did <em>just </em>enough to come out on top against Republican Adam Laxalt by 0.8 points statewide after Biden carried the state by 2.4 points in 2020. She did this by holding onto similar levels of support in places with large Latino populations and by performing on par (or slightly better) in areas with more college-educated white voters, who have been <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving toward Democrats nationally</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as always, Nevada came down to the vote tallies in Clark County (Las Vegas) and Washoe County (Reno), and in the end, Cortez Masto managed to lose a little ground in the former while staying even with Biden in the latter. And because Clark and Washoe contributed the vast majority of the statewide vote, Cortez Masto didn’t benefit much — but also didn’t hurt her chances — by running a tad better than Biden in the rest of the state.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nevada has very few counties with sizable populations, so analyzing the state’s vote means moving below the county level to some extent. The three largest cities in Nevada — <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lasvegascitynevada/PST045221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/hendersoncitynevada/PST045221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henderson</a> and <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/northlasvegascitynevada/PST045221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Las Vegas</a> — are all based in Clark County, and using precinct-level data, we can see that Cortez Masto did a tad better than Biden in wealthier and whiter Henderson while losing a little ground in the more racially and ethnically diverse Las Vegas and North Las Vegas. While she lost Henderson, a more well-educated GOP-leaning city that’s 60 percent white, Cortez Masto actually did 1 point better than Biden. And though she easily carried Las Vegas (42 percent white) and North Las Vegas (just 24 percent), Cortez Masto’s margin of victory was 1 point lower than Biden in the former and 2 points lower in the latter.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are small differences, to be sure, but given the closeness of the race, every little shift mattered. Moreover, Cortez Masto performed almost identically to Biden in Washoe County as a whole, which looks similar to Henderson, another sign that whiter, wealthier and more educated areas in the two major metropolitan centers of the state didn’t break for the GOP but instead helped Cortez Masto stay in office. Turnout was also part of the story, however, as Clark had the sharpest drop in vote share amongst all Nevada counties compared with 2020’s vote totals, and more diverse places like Las Vegas and North Las Vegas saw steeper declines than whiter and more affluent areas like Henderson. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, this doesn’t mean Latino voters, who make up close to 30 percent of the state’s population, weren’t vital to Cortez Masto’s reelection. Equis Research examined the precinct-level vote in Clark and found that, crucially, Cortez Masto’s support in heavily Latino precincts <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosodio/status/1594735846154178560/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was almost identical to Biden’s backing</a> in the same places. As we saw <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">throughout the country in 2020</a>, Biden underperformed 2018 and 2016 Democratic numbers among Hispanics in Clark, but Cortez Masto avoided letting things slip further, which could have cost her reelection.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"> In Georgia’s Dec. 6 runoff, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeated Republican Herschel Walker by nearly 3 points after neither candidate won an outright majority in November. While the urban and suburban counties in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania were crucial to the Democratic wins in those states, Georgia may have provided the best demonstration for how a Democratic candidate’s strong performance in such places led to victory. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-path-to-a-house-majority-goes-through-the-suburbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index</a>,<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index for counties is the natural logarithm of the average number of people within a five-mile radius of every census tract in a given county, based on a weighted average of the population of each census tract. Population data is from the 2020 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> we can see that the more densely populated a county, the better Warnock tended to do compared to Biden’s 2020 margin. Most notably, Warnock increased Democratic vote share across the Atlanta metro area, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/02/us/elections/georgia-senate-results-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running up margins</a> in the city’s increasingly diverse suburbs — a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national trend</a> we’ve seen in major population centers and one that helped Biden win the presidency two years ago.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Warnock’s improvement speaks to the proliferation of parts of the Democratic coalition in the Atlanta area, including a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing base of Black voters</a> and a shift among white college-educated voters toward the party, but also <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/white-populations-decline-in-diversifying-atlanta-suburbs/FLQ55YEVD5CMLBEO23OPRT3CE4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meaningfully large</a> Latino and Asian communities in parts of the region, too. The results also demonstrate how increased diversity in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/28/warnock-walker-georgia-suburbs-cobb-county-democrats-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formerly lily-white suburban counties</a> like Cobb and Fayette has changed the politics of such places dramatically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Warnock’s most impressive showing was in the 11 counties of the <a href="https://atlantaregional.org/about-arc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlanta Regional Commission</a>, which constituted almost half of Georgia’s vote in the 2022 runoff. Warnock won this region by almost 34 points, a 6-point improvement on Biden’s performance. Most of the region’s vote came from four principal counties: DeKalb and Fulton, which contain the city of Atlanta, and Cobb and Gwinnett, which are big suburban counties that sit north of Atlanta. Warnock outperformed Biden’s marks in each county by 5 to 7 points, despite a fair bit of variation in the racial and ethnic makeup of these places: DeKalb and Fulton have majority and plurality Black populations, respectively; Gwinnett’s population is roughly one-third white, one-quarter Black and one-fifth Latino; and Cobb’s population is half white and a quarter Black. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But his improvement over Biden showed up elsewhere in the Atlanta metro area, too. This included strong performances in two fairly different counties just south of the city: Warnock outperformed Biden by 7 points in Clayton County, which is 69 percent Black, but he also outdid Biden by 6 points in Fayette, a majority white and increasingly competitive county next door.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Outside of Atlanta and its environs, Warnock’s improvement over Biden was spottier, but he still tended to do better in counties surrounding other smaller cities in the state, such as Augusta, Columbus, Macon and Savannah, which are also comparatively more urban or suburban than much of the state. For his part, Walker did better than Trump in many places, but as the chart conveys, most of them were rural and less populous, which together couldn’t remotely make up for Walker’s losses in the more populous parts of the state.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The political environment will shift and change before we get to the 2024 election, but these performances show how Democrats can win if they maintain backing from the party base, gain support in increasingly diverse suburbs and campaign even in more rural and whiter places that have moved toward the GOP. It’s of course not all up to Democrats, as Republicans will need to pick <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/upshot/2022-republicans-midterms-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stronger statewide candidates</a> who can challenge Democrats’ ability to make inroads among more GOP-leaning constituencies. But at least in 2022, these four Democrats largely retained most of Biden’s coalition and at times added to it, which ensured Democrats continued control of the Senate in the next Congress.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/07/one-in-four-u-s-parents-say-theyve-struggled-to-afford-food-or-housing-in-the-past-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A quarter of parents</a> across the country have struggled to afford housing in the past 12 months, reflecting a broader problem with housing access amid persistent inflation. These conditions are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/07/03/inflation-homeless-rent-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only adding to America’s ongoing homelessness crisis</a>. While homelessness decreased nationally between <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/whats-behind-rising-homelessness-in-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2007 and 2016</a>, trends <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/briefing/homelessness-america-housing-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have since</a> reversed. More than <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half a million Americans</a> were homeless in January 2020, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new era of uncertainty and joblessness that still lingers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Generally, Americans support tackling housing insecurity, with <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MC_BPC-Housing_ANALYSIS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71 percent saying</a> that it should be at least an important priority for Congress to pass legislation growing the housing supply and improving housing affordability. But research also suggests that while Americans want more kinds of infrastructure to reduce homelessness, far fewer want those resources close to where they themselves live.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this year, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/12/01/opinions-national-vs-local-development-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a> surveyed Americans about building almost 40 kinds of developments, ranging from country clubs to waste management facilities. Regarding social infrastructure, 85 percent of Americans supported building homeless shelters somewhere in the United States. However, when they were asked about building shelters in their own local area, support was over 20 percentage points lower. Support for low-income housing followed a similar pattern, with broad approval for building it someplace in the country (82 percent) but much less for building it locally (65 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This discrepancy isn’t necessarily new or surprising, however. More recently, we’ve seen it play out in American cities throughout the pandemic. For example, in New York City’s Upper West Side, the city <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/11/upper-west-side-homeless-hotels-lucerne-nyc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily housed</a> homeless people in unoccupied hotel rooms. But after local homeowners and renters protested, the city relocated many of the people to other neighborhoods. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“At some level, people want to look good. And so when asked if they support low-income housing, people say yes. But when that housing gets closer and closer, then people start to think about tangible impacts,” said <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/uep/people/faculty/shomon-shamsuddin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shomon Shamsuddin</a>, a professor of social policy at Tufts University. “It no longer becomes something they choose to support in theory. They perceive it as something forced on them by somebody else.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s more than just optics. Ultimately, pushback against affordable housing tends to draw on the assumption that such housing raises crime rates, because people tend to believe the poor are more likely to commit crimes, Shamsuddin said. However, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/24/1074577305/homeless-crime-experts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research suggests</a> that an increase in temporary shelters, like tents, for unhoused people in a given area does not track with an increase in nearby property crime. And that misconception points at an underlying question: Do Americans view homelessness as a crime issue or as a poverty issue? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The aforementioned YouGov poll implies that Americans believe that the people who need affordable housing options are less desirable to have in one’s community. And this idea goes beyond individual citizens. For example, many local governments have focused on <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/tent-encampment-San-Francisco-raid-removal-SFPD-12867393.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using police force and the law</a> to deal with homelessness, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/25/us/los-angeles-police-echo-park-homeless/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">destroying encampments</a> of unhoused people. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Even the term ‘affordable housing’ comes out of an effort to make people more comfortable,” said Shamsuddin. “‘Low-income housing’ has certain [negative] connotations.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And so stigma continues to lurk over affordable housing, even as access to it has become a pressing concern for so many people.</p>



<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>Former President Donald Trump is the least popular he’s been since July 2015, according to a recent <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3863">Quinnipiac University poll</a>. Only 31 percent of registered voters had a positive opinion of him, while nearly twice as many (59 percent) had a negative opinion. Though much of that split is partisan, his numbers among Republicans are also on the decline: Only 70 percent of registered Republican voters see him in a positive light, his lowest in-party popularity since March 2016. And as Trump looks toward a 2024 presidential bid, 70 percent of registered voters said they would not like to see him become the Republican nominee. </li><li>This is the third holiday season since the <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">World Health Organization declared</a> COVID-19 a pandemic, and most Americans no longer consider the virus a factor in planning their festivities. A <a href="https://civicscience.com/more-than-two-thirds-of-americans-say-holiday-plans-will-be-not-at-all-impacted-by-the-pandemic/">CivicScience survey</a> conducted Nov. 13-Dec 12 found that just 8 percent of Americans expected COVID-19 to affect their holiday plans “a lot” — down from 13 percent in 2021 and from 45 percent in 2020. Roughly the same share said they’d “definitely” be spending Christmas with their friends and family this year (60 percent) as said so in 2021 (57 percent); both these figures were notably higher than the share who reported the same in 2020 (29 percent). </li><li>About half of Americans either somewhat (22 percent) or strongly approved (26 percent) the United States’s prisoner exchange with Russia that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/brittney-griner-good-spirits-receiving-care-texas-whs/story?id=94950471%5D">freed American basketball player Brittney Griner</a> last week, per a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/sports/survey-results/daily/2022/12/08/45ba7/1">YouGov survey</a>. Support for the exchange was especially high among Democrats (71 percent), compared with only 34 percent among Republicans. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/sports/survey-results/daily/2022/12/08/45ba7/2">Additional YouGov data</a> found that 49 percent of Americans believed that the Russian justice system unfairly treated Griner, who was arrested early this year on drug trafficking charges related to carrying a personal supply of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/sports/basketball/brittney-griner-athletes-cannabis-marijuana.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article">medical marijuana</a> and was subsequently <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wnba-star-brittney-griner-moved-penal-colony-mordovia/story?id=93508304">sentenced to more than nine years</a> in a penal colony. </li><li>A recently released <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/13/k-12-parents-differ-by-party-in-how-frequently-they-discuss-certain-national-issues-with-their-children/">survey from Pew Research Center</a> found that 25 percent of American parents of K-12 students said racism and racial inequality come up in conversations with their kids very or fairly often. Meanwhile, around 7 in 10 parents said the topics either arise sometimes (39 percent) or rarely, if ever (28 percent). Among Democratic parents of K-12 children, 34 percent said race-related topics come up at least fairly often, while the same frequency was reported by just 15 percent of Republican parents. </li></ul>

<p data-paragraph="main">As the broader electorate shifted left in 2020, compared to 2016, Latino voters shifted 8 percentage points to the right. It was the biggest shift of any demographic group between the two presidential elections and led to some speculation about a possible realignment. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, Galen Druke speaks with Equis Research co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosodio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Odio</a> about whether that trend continued in the 2022 midterms and what it all means for 2024.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Welcome to Invisible Divides, a series exploring the profound differences in worldview between Democrats and Republicans. These beliefs about education, religion, gender and race align with partisanship — but run much deeper. Differences like these don’t just influence the ways Democrats and Republicans vote, but also how they think about their place in America. And they help explain why opposing views on important issues today seem increasingly irreconcilable.</em></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Julian Morein was sitting in the back room of a Hillary Clinton campaign office when he realized that Donald Trump was going to win the 2016 election. He was 17 years old, and although he was just a few months away from being able to vote, he had been spending all of his free time working to get out the vote for Clinton in his home state of Pennsylvania. “I remember everyone my age just feeling like our futures had been stolen,” he said. “The older volunteers were devastated, of course, but they weren’t as angry. For us — the younger people — we felt like the older generations had failed us. And now we were the ones who were going to have to pay.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Six years later, Morein is out of college and working at a nonprofit in Philadelphia. He’s voted in every major election since he turned 18. He’s part of a generation of new voters who became adults in the shadow of the 2016 election. And according to an August <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/538-PerryUndem-YouGov-Survey_Topline-Results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/PerryUndem/YouGov survey</a> of likely voters,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey was conducted via online panel Aug. 10-21, 2022, among 1,796 likely voters, including oversamples of Black, Latino and Asian American/Pacific Islander respondents. Likely voters included registered voters who said that they are “almost certain to” or will “probably” vote in the November midterm elections. The sample was weighted to match the general population. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> politics is especially personal for Generation Z.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Younger voters and older voters see different problems" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/elJBa/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="324" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The youngest generation of voters is more likely than older groups to vote for Democrats — but it also has a much more radical view of how the country should address long-standing problems. According to our survey and others, voters ages 18 to 29<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other age groups included ages 30 to 44, ages 45 to 59 and ages 60 or older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> are more likely than any other cohort — even those only a decade or two older — to say that abortion should always be legal,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked whether abortion should be “legal in all cases,” “legal in most cases,” “illegal in most cases” or “illegal in all cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> that racism and racial inequality are big problems in the U.S.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked how big of a problem 11 different issues were. Other response options included “somewhat of a problem,” “small problem,” “not a problem at all” or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> and that they favored dramatic moves to undo injustices of the past, like cash payments to descendants of enslaved people.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were given two ways the U.S. government could atone for or make amends for the country’s history of slavery and discrimination. They were asked whether they favored or opposed each way. Options included “strongly” or “somewhat” favor, “strongly” or “somewhat” oppose or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> What’s more, many young Americans have told us that they feel compelled to vote because their values and goals feel so at odds with the people controlling the levers of power.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Historic events of the past few years have defined many young voters’ worldviews, too. One such watershed moment was the May 2020 video of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling for nine minutes on the neck of a 46-year-old Black man, George Floyd, killing him. A summer of protests against racial injustice throughout the country would follow, along with Chauvin’s conviction.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Voters under 30 were most likely to view racism as a systemic problem that must be addressed. In our survey with PerryUndem and YouGov, they were the only age group with a majority (57 percent) in favor of cash payments for descendants of enslaved people. When we asked whether they agreed with the statement, “White men are the most attacked group in the country right now,” only 26 percent agreed, the least of any age group. They were also the most likely to think that people of color becoming a majority of the U.S. population would strengthen the country, with 39 percent saying so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Younger voters are divided on reparations" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/W6LvE/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="282" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The group overall was also much more likely to support the Black Lives Matter movement, with 63 percent saying they did. Support for the Black Lives Matter movement broke down along especially partisan lines, as it was the biggest predictor of how respondents planned to vote (more than 4 in 5 of those who agreed with the statement “I support Black Lives Matter,” “definitely” or “probably” planned to vote for Democrats, and similarly, more than 4 in 5 of those who disagreed planned to vote for Republicans).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some ways, this generation of voters is already living in the United States of the future, which may be driving their attitudes. According to the <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/index.php/latest-research/more-8-million-youth-are-newly-eligible-voters-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University</a>, the country’s youngest voters are also its most diverse age group, in every region. They’re becoming adults in a nation that already looks more like it will in 2050 — <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2008/02/11/us-population-projections-2005-2050/#:~:text=By%202050%2C%20the%20nation's%20racial,2005%20to%2029%25%20in%202050." target="_blank" rel="noopener">when demographers project that non-Hispanic white Americans will be a minority</a> — than the past. There’s also some evidence these young voters have been learning about racial inequities in and outside of school: Over half said that they had recently read books that dealt with racism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The young voters we spoke to did not all offer unqualified support for the Black Lives Matter organization itself, but many were generally well informed about the movement’s mission and goals. Matthew Messina, a 20-year-old college student from New Jersey, agreed with most of the group’s values relating to racial equity and social justice, but disagreed with some of their advocacy on specific issues, like defunding police departments. “I think [reforming policing should mean] more of funding social programs, increasing access to counselors for people in mental health crises, like that kind of thing,” he said. <br><br>Sergio Mata, a 30-year-old artist from San Antonio, said his support of the Black Lives Matter movement had cooled since he’d heard about <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/04/black-lives-matter-6-million-dollar-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Magazine reporting that raised questions</a> about how the organization was spending its donations. But he still believed in its ideals and sees racism in his everyday life. Mata, who is Latino, said San Antonio still feels like a very segregated city. “They say the white people live on the north side, Black people live on the east side, and then the Mexicans live on the west side,” he said. “And even to this day, you could still feel that mentality here.” Despite that, he still feels that his home city is a more liberal island in a conservative state. He feels uncomfortable traveling elsewhere in Texas, like when he visits his boyfriend’s family near Waco.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Mata, legalizing marijuana would be a big step toward erasing racial disparities in the justice system. “I don't want any people I know sitting in prison over something that's fully legalized in other states,” he said. “That still really upsets me.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelly Jacobs, a 26-year-old graduate student who lives in Delaware, wants politicians to start at a more fundamental level. “I want them to publicly acknowledge that racism still exists, and it’s still a huge problem,” she said of the people she voted to elect. “Systematically, we need change.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Dobbs ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion was another turning point for some young voters — evidence to them that the country was going backwards, not just on abortion rights but on a wide range of connected issues. As abortion bans started being implemented in states around the country, Jacobs realized that it was closing opportunities for her. “There will be certain states where I can’t take a job now because I know I won’t have a right to an abortion if I need one,” Jacobs said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The conservative court’s ruling was particularly at odds with the views of young Americans, who have become much more supportive of abortion rights over the past twenty years. According to Gallup, which has conducted regular surveys of Americans' attitudes toward abortion for decades, nearly half (47 percent) of 18- to 34-year olds in 2022 said they supported abortion rights under <em>any</em> circumstances, up from 28 percent in 2001.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Young Americans have grown more liberal on abortion" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a3Nd7/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as with race, many young voters don’t see abortion as a discrete issue, affecting only the people who want to end a pregnancy. A <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/PerryUndem-Guide-to-Impact-of-Dobbs-on-Voters-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate PerryUndem survey</a> (not conducted in partnership with FiveThirtyEight) conducted after the Dobbs ruling found that young adults (ages 18-29) were more likely than older age groups to say that it made them think about how abortion relates to other issues like sexism and racism, losing access to birth control and the potential for LGBTQ people to lose the right to marry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Young adults see a link between abortion and other issues" aria-label="Range Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dbReK/11/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="376" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Joshua Martinez, a 21-year-old who identifies as an independent but voted for several Republican candidates in the midterms, told us that he thought the justices were right to let the states set their own agendas on abortion. But he was concerned that the Dobbs ruling might signal the court’s willingness to roll back other protections, like gay marriage. “That could impact people I care about,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These major news events may reshape the electorate. The PerryUndem survey found that young adults were more likely than any other age group to say that the Dobbs decision made them want to vote in the midterms and would have a long-term impact on who they vote for. But even if younger Americans simply followed the typical pattern for all voters and vote more frequently as they grow older, the experiences that could shape their political evolution are happening now — which could in turn shape the future of the country.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion-rights advocates took their fight to the states — and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-rights-are-reshaping-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they won</a>. The pro-choice side emerged victorious in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/where-americans-voted-to-protect-abortion-rights-in-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly every 2022 election</a> where abortion rights were at stake — including five <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-abortion-vote-in-kansas-looks-like-its-going-to-be-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ballot</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ballot-measures-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measures</a> to either enshrine or abolish abortion rights in state constitutions. For many liberals, it felt like they had hit upon a winning strategy to protect abortion rights in a post-Roe world: bring the issue directly to the people. Talk quickly started about putting more pro-abortion-rights amendments <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/abortion-dobbs-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the ballot in 2024</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a problem: Many states don’t let citizens put constitutional amendments on the ballot. And that includes most of the states with the strictest abortion bans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Can your state protect abortion rights in its constitution?" aria-label="Map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MWV2I/36/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="747" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the 22 states that have a total or six-week abortion ban on the books (including states where courts have temporarily put the ban on hold), 15 do not allow <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/chart-of-the-initiative-states.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citizen-initiated constitutional amendments</a>.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of these states, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, do allow citizen-initiated &lt;em&gt;statutes&lt;/em&gt; to be put on the ballot, but there is &lt;a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Legislative_alteration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nothing stopping&lt;/a&gt; their legislatures from simply repealing those statutes if they pass. In Wyoming, the legislature would have to wait two years before fully repealing the statute, though it could amend it (i.e., water it down) at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>12</sup></a> This includes some of the biggest and most important states for abortion access, like Texas, which, according to the American Community Survey, is home to nearly seven million reproductive-age women.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women between the ages of 15 and 49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> Overall, nearly 20 million reproductive-age women live in those 15 states, which means their access to abortion can’t be changed by residents who want to put abortion rights on the ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it is possible for voters to nullify an existing ban in the other seven states, which are home to just over seven million reproductive-age women. A ballot measure enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution — like the one Michigan voters <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2022/11/proposal-3-passes-etching-abortion-rights-into-michigan-constitution.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed in 2022</a> — could legalize abortion in Arkansas, <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article269733961.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missouri</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/oklahoma-citizen-led-initiative-codify-abortion-access-94241128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/medicaid-expansion-leads-in-south-dakota-eyes-turn-to-florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Dakota</a>. It would put a decisive end to the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2022/10/07/arizona-abortion-law-state-appeals-court-puts-1864-ban-hold/8210265001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/judge-puts-on-hold-north-dakota-trigger-law-banning-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fights</a> over Arizona’s and North Dakota’s bans as well. The biggest battle could be in <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/11/10/in-the-wake-of-gop-supreme-court-sweep-ohio-activists-plan-ballot-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a>, where a six-week ban is currently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-ohio-mike-dewine-government-and-politics-43558a59477f0260f7eec6db33fd30f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked in court</a> but there has been talk of passing an <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/06/24/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-ohio-heartbeat-abortion-ban/9822059002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even stricter ban</a> that covers all stages of pregnancy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, these amendments still wouldn’t be easy to pass. According to <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;map=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling by Civiqs</a>, a majority of adults in Arkansas, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota believe abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. And in Ohio, where a majority of adults do support legal abortion in most circumstances, Republicans have proposed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ohio-united-states-voter-registration-c2c927bf564521d5b3d18dfc69e21374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising the threshold</a> to pass any citizen-initiated constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60 percent. Republicans have denied that this is an <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/11/18/legal-expert-voter-advocates-slam-ohio-gop-plan-to-make-citizen-ballot-initiatives-harder-to-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intentional attempt</a> to make it harder for a potential abortion-rights amendment to pass, but it would certainly have that effect. Abortion-rights advocates might end up having the best shot in Arizona, where a majority of residents think abortion should be legal in most cases, and a 19th-century ban on abortion is being challenged in the courts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few other states could also see abortion-related ballot measures in the future, even if they wouldn’t change the law as it stands right now. For example, abortion is currently legal before 20 weeks in Nebraska, but it’s possible the state will pass a stricter ban in the next few years.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although state Republicans &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/nebraska-governor-call-special-session-discuss-12-week/story?id=88140763" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;did not have enough support&lt;/a&gt; to pass even a 12-week ban last summer, they may try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a> However, since Nebraska allows citizen-initiated constitutional amendments, a Michigan-style ballot measure could guard against this.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And abortion is currently protected in under the Florida and Montana state constitutions, but only because their state supreme courts have said so. And they could very well <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/political/abortion-advocates-worry-unfavorable-ruling-ahead-after-florida-supreme-courts-erroneous-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change their minds</a> — there are currently <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2022/08/09/montana-abortion-laws-will-remain-on-hold-state-supreme-court-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion-related cases</a> pending before both courts. Abortion-rights advocates may try to pass amendments explicitly protecting abortion rights in these states, too, as insurance against future unfavorable rulings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, Colorado, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon could use citizen-initiated constitutional amendments to protect abortion rights as well.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois also allows citizen-initiated constitutional amendments, but they are “&lt;a href="https://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/con14.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;limited to structural and procedural subjects&lt;/a&gt;” about the legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>15</sup></a> Although abortion rights aren’t seriously threatened in these states, advocates may want to put pro-abortion-rights measures on their ballots anyway as a symbolic move (or to protect against extreme future scenarios) — similar to amendments passed by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-08/2022-california-election-proposition-1-abortion-rights-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/11/08/measure-to-enshrine-abortion-rights-in-vermont-constitution-poised-to-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont</a> in the 2022 election. In fact, Democrats may see an advantage to be gained by doing so. In Michigan this year, high interest in the abortion amendment appeared to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-house-election-margin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buoy Democrats up and down the ballot</a> (though this <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-11-21/california-role-2022-midterm-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not appear to be true</a> in California). Although most of these states are solidly blue, voters motivated by an abortion-rights measure could theoretically boost Democrats in districts like Colorado’s 3rd — where a Democrat nearly unseated Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert in November — and Oregon’s 5th. Of course, with 2024 being a presidential election year, many voters won’t need to be told twice to go to the polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Dec. 14, 2022, 1:50 p.m.):</strong> This story has been updated to make clear that each state’s share of women 15-49 is relative to national numbers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Dec. 14, 2022, 2:10 p.m.):</strong> A previous version of this story said Illinois could pass a citizen-initiated constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights. However, constitutional amendments in Illinois are limited to changes in legislative structure or procedures.</p>]]></description>

						<p>This article is part of our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/american-issues/">America's Issues</a> series.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			


<p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 midterms are now in the rearview mirror, but Americans have only begun to process the ramifications on politics and government. Although Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, Democrats avoided <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sizable losses</a> the president’s party tends to suffer in midterm House elections and even gained a seat in the Senate. Now, a closely divided Congress and President Biden will have to work together, a trying task in our hyperpartisan political environment — perhaps made harder by the specter of the 2024 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With all of that in mind, we’re wrapping up our <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos panel survey</a> by looking at which issues drove Americans’ votes in the midterm election as well as their broader attitudes toward politics following the results. This marked the seventh and final wave of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/american-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling collaboration</a> using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, and this time we asked the same 2,000 Americans how they felt about the election, what policies the next Congress should pursue and their early views of the potential 2024 presidential candidates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Throughout our polling series, we’ve asked Americans what issues they viewed as most pressing for the nation. And just like in each of our six preelection polls, respondents ranked “inflation or increasing costs” as the most important issue facing the country (62 percent) in the days following the election.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted Nov. 9-21, 2022, among 1,509 U.S. adults. As was the case in the previous waves of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple-choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. The sample is weighted to match the general adult population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> “Political extremism or polarization” (33 percent) and “crime or gun violence” (28 percent) continued to rank second and third, respectively. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This time around, we also asked voters to pick the one issue, if any, that most impacted their vote choice in the midterms.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters, a subsample in our survey, consisted of respondents who answered “yes” when asked if they voted in the 2022 midterm elections. They were then given the same list of 20 issues that we provided when asking about the most important issues, including “other” or “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> Inflation or increasing costs (29 percent) and political polarization or extremism (19 percent) were top of mind again, while abortion ranked third (12 percent). Abortion was an especially big issue for Democratic voters, as 20 percent said it was their top voting issue, placing it behind only political extremism (29 percent). In contrast, half of Republican voters named inflation or increasing costs (50 percent) as their top voting issue, far ahead of any other concerns. Independent voters, as they often do, fell somewhere between Democrats and Republicans on their top voting issues, as the chart below shows.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independents included respondents who identified as “independent” or “something else,” or who skipped the question for party identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Americans were divided over why they voted" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wi9xl/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="616" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, while it’s easy to focus on just voters and the voting process, we were also interested in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why many people <em>didn’t</em> participate in the election</a>. Among Americans who did not vote this year, 34 percent stated that they never vote in elections<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonvoters were asked if any of eight possible reasons explained why they did not vote in the 2022 midterm elections. For each reason, they could answer “yes,” “no” or “don’t know,” or skip the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> — a reminder that while <a href="https://www.electproject.org/2022g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turnout was high in 2022</a> (<a href="https://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for a midterm</a>) and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/turnout-soared-in-2020-as-nearly-two-thirds-of-eligible-u-s-voters-cast-ballots-for-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-setting in 2020</a> (for a modern presidential race), a large swath of potential voters is consistently uninvolved. Meanwhile, about 1 in 4 nonvoters felt that “none of the candidates were good options,” and another 1 in 4 “did not have enough information about the candidates and/or ballot initiatives.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, regardless of whether they voted, Americans were marginally optimistic about the state of democracy after the 2022 midterm elections. Overall, 43 percent said they were “very” or “somewhat” optimistic, compared with 33 percent who were pessimistic (the other respondents mostly didn’t know). Unlike after the 2020 election, when former President Donald Trump’s claims about election fraud <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran rampant on the right</a>, such calls don’t seem as frequent this time around (at least so far), and it showed in public opinion. While almost half of Americans agreed that they were surprised by the outcome of the 2022 midterm election (44 percent), this didn’t necessarily breed mistrust.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked how much they agreed or disagreed with several statements. They could choose “strongly” or “somewhat” agree, “strongly” or “somewhat” disagree or “don’t know,” or they could skip the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> In fact, 69 percent of Americans agreed that they trusted the results of the midterms, compared with only 16 percent who disagreed. Democrats were more likely to say they trusted the results (88 percent), but a healthy majority of Republicans (65 percent) said the same — a change from what we saw two years ago.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans were more divided, though, over what actions they would like to see the next Congress take. In fact, there was only one topic with broad bipartisan agreement: reducing inflation.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents could select up to three issues from a list of 17, including “other” or “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> Overall, 57 percent of Americans said fighting against increased costs should be one of the leading issues that Congress should focus on, with majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents naming it as a top priority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Reducing inflation is Americans' top priority for Congress" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7dNUx/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="576" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regarding other issues, Americans’ desires largely rested on which party they belonged to. Unsurprisingly, Democrats were far more likely to prioritize enshrining in federal law the right to an abortion, while Republicans were much more inclined to prefer Congress focus on stopping immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. On fiscal issues, Democrats much preferred Congress raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, whereas Republicans wanted cuts to federal spending. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These partisan splits also showed up when we asked Americans whether they supported different policy ideas that Congress could address.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were classified as in support of these seven policy ideas if they said they “strongly support” or “somewhat support” a policy idea. Respondents could also skip a policy or say that they didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> When asked if they supported up to $10,000 in student loan forgiveness for Americans making under $125,000, 4 in 5 Democrats supported the proposal, compared with only 1 in 5 Republicans. Conversely, 3 in 5 Republicans supported impeaching Biden, which only 1 in 20 Democrats backed. Still, one proposal with potential bipartisan support was pardoning those with prior federal convictions for marijuana possession: Fifty-nine percent backed the idea, including 75 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and 50 percent of Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as Congress and the White House address — or don’t address — these issues and proposals, they will be awash in speculation about the 2024 presidential race. We asked respondents whether they were likely to vote in the Democratic or Republican presidential primary, and which potential contender they might prefer. And 2022 midterm voters were remarkably cool on both Biden and Trump, with the former having <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/06/us/politics/biden-running-president-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not yet made his 2024 intentions clear</a> and the latter having <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-2024-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared his candidacy</a> while the poll was in the field.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Among midterm voters, 44 percent planned to vote in the GOP presidential primary,<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options included voting in the Democratic presidential primary, “I do not plan to vote in the primary,” “I cannot vote in the primary because my state has closed primaries” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-desantis-is-a-major-threat-to-trumps-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in keeping with</a> many <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-midterm polls</a>, they didn’t firmly line up behind Trump. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis led with 42 percent among these respondents, followed by Trump with 24 percent and former Vice President Mike Pence with 5 percent.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents who said that they would vote in the Republican presidential primary were asked who they would like to be the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election from a list of 12 GOP politicians (with their titles included for context). They could also specify someone else, select “don’t know” or skip the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> No other candidate cleared 5 percent, and 15 percent said they didn’t know who they would support. But at this early vantage point, this survey adds further fuel to the fire that we could be on our way to a Trump-DeSantis clash in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, 40 percent of midterm voters anticipated participating in the Democratic presidential primary. Despite his incumbency, Biden held a notably lackluster edge: He led with 14 percent, followed by Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg with 12 percent, Vice President Kamala Harris with 9 percent and California Gov. Gavin Newsom with 7 percent.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents who said that they would vote in the Democratic presidential primary were asked who they would like to be the Democratic nominee in the 2024 presidential election from a list of 12 Democratic politicians (with their titles included for context). They could also specify someone else, select “don’t know” or skip the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> For their part, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez each had around 5 percent. A whopping 26 percent weren’t sure who they’d support, which may reflect the broader uncertainty over whether Biden runs for reelection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past seven months, we’ve learned that rising costs and major events — such as the shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade —  heavily weighed on the minds of Americans ahead of the November elections. And while this is the final entry in our polling series, there’s little question that the public’s views will continue to shift in response to their top concerns and the actions of elected officials in Washington.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Remember when Georgia’s runoff gave Democrats 51 seats in the U.S. Senate? Well, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema said <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1784697-lee-corsos-not-so-fast-gets-autotuned-by-espn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not so fast, my friend</a>: This morning, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2022/12/09/sen-kyrsten-sinema-of-arizona-why-im-registering-as-an-independent/69712395007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinema announced</a> she would change her party registration to independent and no longer identify as a Democrat moving forward. On paper, then, the next Senate’s makeup will be 49 Republicans, 48 Democrats and three independents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Sinema’s switch doesn’t necessarily change the Senate’s voting math. Sinema told the Arizona Republic she <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/12/09/sen-kyrsten-sinema-leaves-democratic-party-to-become-an-independent/69710762007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intends to mostly align</a> with the Democrats and keep her committee assignments from that party (which Majority Leader Chuck Schumer <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/09/krysten-sinema-independent-white-house-00073243" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed he had agreed to honor</a>). Alongside fellow independent Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, she appears set to give the party 51 seats when it comes to organizational questions, allowing them to hold majorities on committees. Considering that she may not alter her legislative habits, why did Sinema make this decision? Her reelection outlook in 2024 may help explain her move, although her centrist attitudes likely played some role.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To some, Sinema’s party switch might not come as a surprise <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kyrsten-sinema-is-confounding-her-own-party-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering her moderate reputation</a>. After all, she has the second-most conservative voting record in the Senate among Democrats,<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including King and Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> according to roll-call data <a href="https://voteview.com/congress/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Voteview.com</a>, with only West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin coming in to her right. Since joining the Senate, she’s taken public stances against Democratic efforts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/13/how-kyrsten-sinema-defended-filibuster-bipartisanship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to abolish the filibuster</a> and, along with Manchin, pushed her party <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/23/sinema-35t-spending-bill-506583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to sharply reduce</a> the outlays in budgetary legislation. Her positions have infuriated many Arizona Democrats, and the state party <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/22/senator-kyrsten-sinema-censured-arizona-democratic-party-board-filibuster-vote/6620816001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formally censured her</a> over her 2022 vote to retain the filibuster, which helped block Democratic efforts to pass voting rights legislation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Sinema’s tendency to split from her party probably doesn’t explain her decision by itself. If that were the case, we might expect Manchin <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-manchin-actually-leave-the-democratic-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to have switched parties</a> as well. In <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/crossing-the-aisle/519F5A3C501380C42ABB4B1E041DC946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his study of party switchers</a> from 1950 to 2014, political scientist Antoine Yoshinaka found that a member of Congress’s voting record didn’t do a good job of predicting party switchers on its own, even though party switchers were more likely to be out of sync with their party ideologically. He found that ideological disagreement usually had to occur alongside a desire to run for higher office or to gain a more valuable committee post to produce a greater likelihood of changing parties. Sinema, however, is already in a high office as senator — a presidential bid as a centrist independent seems unlikely, though we shouldn’t rule that out — and if she votes similarly to how she has previously, it won’t be as if she made a full-on party switch to the GOP and received a plum committee assignment as part of the deal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a solid chance Sinema’s 2024 electoral outlook played into her decision-making process. Sinema <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/sinemas-decision-quit-democratic-party-jolts-arizona-2024-senate-race-rcna60947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t said</a> whether she plans to run for reelection, but there’s little question that her tendency to break with her former party has outraged much of the Democratic base that helped put her in the Senate in the first place. A <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/9_27_2022_tables.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University/Arizona Republic poll</a> of the state in September found that Democratic likely voters viewed her quite negatively, with 49 percent holding an unfavorable opinion and 30 percent a favorable one. Facing a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23323231/ruben-gallego-arizona-latino-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential primary challenge</a> on her left from Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, Sinema stood a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/1/26/poll-arizona-senator-kyrsten-sinema-set-to-be-unseated-by-possible-challenger-ruben-gallego-in-2024-primary-landslide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real chance of losing renomination</a> if she sought reelection as a Democrat (she might’ve been in trouble against a more center-left Democrat, too, like <a href="https://twitter.com/gregstantonaz/status/1601307744874921984?s=20&amp;t=Klli74t_qEhe6Oh9m0lGWg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Greg Stanton</a>). Tellingly, Yoshinaka’s study found the prospect of facing a highly competitive primary in one’s own party can play into leaving that party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, if Sinema’s chances of winning a Democratic primary were mediocre at best, it’s unclear how much stronger her path would be as an independent. It’s hard to imagine Republicans deciding not to field a major candidate against Sinema even if she’s an independent, but it’s possible she is hoping that the potential complications of a three-way race discourage a high-profile Democrat like Gallego from running. In that scenario, perhaps Democrats line up behind her in a head-to-head race against a Republican. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Gallego has already responded to Sinema’s switch <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/09/ruben-gallego-campaign-senate-kyrsten-sinema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by sending out fundraising texts</a> that say he’s considering a Senate run. Now, Sinema might be able to put together a mishmash coalition of Democrats, Republicans and independents to win a three-way contest. After all, that Suffolk poll found that Republican likely voters also had a slightly more positive view of her than Democrats (35 percent favorable, 40 percent unfavorable), while independent likely voters had net-positive attitudes (42 percent favorable, 27 percent unfavorable). And she could attract plurality support if Democrats and Republicans nominate candidates who are viewed as too far left or right. That’s a possibility, too, as Gallego is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and Arizona Republicans just nominated far-right contenders Blake Masters and Kari Lake in the 2022 Senate and gubernatorial races, respectively.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Sinema could certainly also find herself running in last place. Yoshinaka’s study found party switchers suffer an electoral penalty in their first general election after switching, with an average decline of 4 to 9 percentage points in vote share. Having upset Democrats, Sinema might lose most of their support to the Democratic pick, and there’s no guarantee that many Republicans back her over their party’s nominee, even if that candidate is highly problematic. While <a href="https://azsos.gov/elections/results-data/voter-registration-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona does have</a> 1.4 million registered voters who aren’t registered as Republicans (1.4 million voters) or Democrats (1.3 million), we also know that most self-identified independents <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-americans-who-identify-as-independent-are-actually-independent-thats-really-bad-for-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lean toward one party or the other</a>. So getting voters to eschew the major-party candidates won’t be easy, especially if Sinema isn’t overwhelmingly popular (the Suffolk poll put her overall favorability at 36 percent favorable, 38 percent unfavorable).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The difficulties Sinema is likely to encounter speak to why senators rarely switch parties, and why it’s even more unusual for them to become — and stay — independent. Sinema is just the 10th senator since 1951 to formally switch parties while in office, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/senators_changed_parties.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the U.S. Senate</a>, as the table below shows:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of this group, Sinema is the sixth to become an independent at some point, but only three prior to her actually stuck with identifying that way. Of those, Sen. Harry Byrd Jr. of Virginia might make the most interesting comparison to Sinema: A conservative Democrat, <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/byrd-harry-flood-jr-1914-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he refused to take an oath</a> saying he would back the party’s nominee for president in 1972, ahead of his 1970 reelection campaign. He instead ran as an independent, thereby avoiding a primary challenge, and <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/78732/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a majority</a> of the vote over Democratic and Republican opposition (he’d win <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/48412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 1976</a> as well, although throughout that time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/us/harry-f-byrd-virginia-senator-dies-at-98.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he still caucused with the Democrats</a>). Sinema, it seems, will be aiming to pull off the same trick in 2024 — that is, should she choose to run again. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Kevin McCarthy is the obvious candidate for the next speaker of the House. Republicans flipped the chamber in 2022, and McCarthy is already House minority leader. He has no serious rivals, and former President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/trump-endorses-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed his bid</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But McCarthy has a problem: He may not have the votes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans will start the 118th Congress with only a narrow majority in the House — just 222 seats to the Democrats’ 212.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One seat will be vacant because of the &lt;a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-rep-donald-mceachin-dies-at-61/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Democratic Rep. Donald McEachin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>23</sup></a> And six incoming Republican representatives have already said they will not vote for McCarthy for speaker. That would leave McCarthy with 216 votes at most — two shy of a majority. And that’s just the people who have publicly announced their opposition. (Several other Republicans are ideologically similar and could oppose him, too.) So this could be the first speaker election that has gone to multiple ballots <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-Multiple-Ballots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1923</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But don’t get too excited, Democrats: This isn’t an episode of The West Wing<em> </em>where a consensus candidate could become speaker with support from Republicans and Democrats. There are still several ways this ends with a Speaker McCarthy.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few different tools we can use to categorize the political interests of members of Congress. First, there’s the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean. Partisan leans have not yet been updated with the results of the 2022 election.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">But their opposition probably <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t just based on ideology</a>. The five incumbent members on this list<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they haven’t cast any roll-call votes yet, people who were just elected for the first time in 2022 don’t have DW-NOMINATE scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> have very negative scores on the <em>second</em> dimension of DW-NOMINATE, which roughly quantifies how establishment (positive numbers) or anti-establishment (negative numbers) a member of Congress is. Four of the five are also members of the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/20/house-freedom-caucus-what-is-it-and-whos-in-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Caucus</a>, essentially the governing wing of the old tea party — a very conservative group, notoriously hostile to the establishment and unwilling to compromise. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McCarthy has been a member of House GOP leadership since 2009, so it makes sense that anti-establishment Republicans are keen to oppose him. Rep. Andy Biggs, also <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/06/opinion-im-running-to-replace-kevin-mccarthy-as-house-speaker-and-break-the-establishment-rep-andy-biggs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running for speaker</a>, has practically confirmed this sentiment, <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1600160193349767169?s=20&amp;t=7LAmEaQ7ighY1l9U6MliPg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a>, “Kevin McCarthy was created by, elevated by, and maintained by the establishment.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And unfortunately for McCarthy, several more Republicans might agree with them. The next House will include 10 other Republicans who are either more conservative or anti-establishment (according to DW-NOMINATE) than at least one anti-McCarthy Republican. Three (Reps. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/midterm-elections-congress-house-results/card/marjorie-taylor-greene-backs-kevin-mccarthy-for-house-speaker-r0Gwt5eZy2QmqL9gXWnT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/15/freedom-caucus-kevin-mccarthy-house-speaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Massie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1600595462356172800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom McClintock</a>) say they intend to vote for McCarthy, but the other seven could be ripe to oppose him. For example, Rep. Chip Roy <a href="https://radio.foxnews.com/2022/12/05/congressman-chip-roy-the-need-for-new-republican-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has yet to say</a> whom he will support for speaker on the House floor. But he did <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/11/15/chip-roy-speaker-house-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominate Biggs</a> over McCarthy to be the GOP’s official nominee for speaker in a caucus meeting on Nov. 15.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And the list of McCarthy opponents could be even longer because of new Republicans who were just elected in November.

<p data-paragraph="main">Others either didn’t respond to our inquiries or said they were still making up their mind. For example, in an email, Rep.-elect Anna Paulina Luna told FiveThirtyEight, “I will vote on January 3rd for whoever allows me to best represent my constituents… I do not like to publicly disclose my private conversations with my colleagues.” And a spokesperson for Rep.-elect Josh Brecheen told us he “has not taken a decided position on speaker, but is praying and considering all information.” (Both Brecheen and Luna, by the way, were elected with help from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/02/new-class-combative-maga-candidates-poised-roil-house-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Freedom Caucus</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But all this doesn’t mean McCarthy is doomed. He may not have 218 votes right now, but there’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/02/who-could-be-speaker-if-not-kevin-mccarthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no obvious alternative</a> to him, either. So the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/do-you-buy-that-mccarthy-will-eventually-become-speaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likeliest outcome</a> may be that he wins the speakership after putting in a little elbow grease. According to Axios, McCarthy has been <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/30/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-freedom-caucus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meeting with some of his detractors</a>. And while four have told reporters that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/29/mccarthy-house-speaker-republicans-opposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nothing will change their minds</a>, the other two may be more malleable. Rep. Matt Rosendale told Puck News he would vote for McCarthy in “<a href="https://puck.news/anyone-but-mccarthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme circumstances</a>,” which means that there are <em>some</em> circumstances in which he would vote for him. Meanwhile, Rep.-elect Mike Collins pledged to vote against McCarthy in September 2021 when he <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/09/17/mike-collins-launches-10th-congressional-district-bid-in-trumps-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched his campaign</a>. His spokesperson has not responded to multiple inquiries about whether he will keep his promise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McCarthy has another reason for optimism: Technically, he doesn’t even need 218 votes to become speaker. He needs only a majority of the votes cast for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/22/house-speaker-mccarthy-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named candidate</a>. So if some members skip the vote or abstain (in House parlance, vote “present”), it would lower the number he needs to hit. Biggs, Rep. Matt Gaetz, Rep. Bob Good, Rep. Ralph Norman and Rosendale have all said <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/3757326-mccarthy-readies-for-floor-showdown-in-speakership-bid-as-opponents-dig-in-heels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they will not vote “present.”</a> Still, that could be a way for them to not oppose McCarthy without saying they changed their mind. So McCarthy could win the speakership if three of his opponents (including Democrats!) skip the vote or vote “present,” assuming every other Republican votes for him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As messy as these scenarios would be, they are still likelier than the Democratic dream scenario that some <a href="https://omaha.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/bacon-would-work-with-dems-to-elect-moderate-house-speaker-if-gops-mccarthy-falls-short/article_ecfa7c66-6491-11ed-9123-5393236e49c4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate Republicans</a> would work with Democrats to elect a compromise candidate. The last time a majority party failed to elect a speaker was 1839, when Democrats held the House majority but party infighting <a href="https://history.house.gov/Blog/2014/April/4-8-A-Mob-in-Search-of-a-Speaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led to the election</a> of Whig Rep. Robert M.T. Hunter with bipartisan support. It’s unlikely that that streak will break when the two parties are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively hostile toward each other</a> and the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">furthest apart ideologically</a> that they have been in at least 50 years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The official nominee of the party that controls the House has won <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL30857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every speaker election since at least 1913</a>, even when its majority was narrower than it is now. So it may not be smooth sailing, but Republicans will likely get their preferred speaker one way or another. Kevin McCarthy is just hoping it’s him.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">When President Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/04/briefing/railroad-workers-demands.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a bill to prevent a rail-worker strike</a> this past Friday, it was only the latest in a series of union actions that have gotten national attention in the past few years. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/02/1124680518/starbucks-union-busting-howard-schultz-nlrb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starbucks</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/02/amazon-workers-just-voted-to-join-a-union-heres-what-happens-next-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> workers are trying to unionize around the country. Nationwide, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/8/30/23326654/2022-union-charts-elections-wins-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">78,000 workers</a> went on strike in the first half of the year. Members of The New York Times Guild <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/12/08/new-york-times-walkout-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walked out on Thursday</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The National Labor Relations Board reported a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/union-election-petitions-increase-57-in-first-half-of-fiscal-year-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">57 percent increase</a> in the number of union elections in the first half of the 2022 fiscal year — Oct. 1, 2021, through March 31 this year — and unions are <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/8/30/23326654/2022-union-charts-elections-wins-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning</a> more than three quarters of their votes. And the share of Americans who support unions, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398303/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71 percent</a>, is at the highest level since 1965, according to Gallup. After a decades-long slump, organized labor is on the upswing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of this undoubtedly results from the tumult in workplaces throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. First, essential workers who couldn’t stay home <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-covid-19-hazard-continues-but-the-hazard-pay-does-not-why-americas-frontline-workers-need-a-raise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banded together to demand</a> more safety measures in the months when the virus was new and vaccines weren’t yet available. Then, as workplaces and the country began reopening, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/half-of-us-states-hit-record-low-unemployment-rates-in-2022-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unemployment plummeted</a> and has stayed low. Despite some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/layoffs-sweeping-the-us-these-are-the-companies-making-cuts-2022-5#morgan-stanley-about-1600-workers-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent mass layoffs</a>, especially in tech and journalism, the labor market is so far mostly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/02/november-jobs-report-fed-labor-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defying fears of a recession</a> and ignoring the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame it. That has put workers in a relatively powerful position, at least up to now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Workers have recently undertaken <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/reports-and-publications/labor-action-tracker-annual-report-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything from work stoppages to strikes for better pay and working conditions</a>, according to data from the ILR Worker Institute at Cornell University. The institute has seen a “noticeable uptick” in union activity this year compared with the previous year, <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/reports-and-publications/labor-action-tracker-annual-report-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Johnnie Kallas</a>, a Ph.D. candidate who is the project director of the ILR Worker Institute’s Labor Action Tracker. But it’s hard to know how that compares with the past. Because of budget cuts in the Reagan era, the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/reports-and-publications/labor-action-tracker-annual-report-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped tracking</a> all but the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/wkstp/annual-listing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest labor actions</a>. It’s also unclear if recent labor actions will translate into long-term change for workplaces, unions and the workers they represent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For most of the time since the 1930s, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398303/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority of Americans have favored labor unions</a>, but support began to decline in the 1960s, dropping from 71 percent in 1965 to 55 percent by 1979. After a slight increase, Americans’ support of unions hit a low of 48 percent in 2009. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chart-union-membership-changes-decline-over-the-years-2022-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share of private-sector workers in unions</a> also declined steadily since the 1980s. This was caused by a <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-us-labor-unions-and-why-they-still-matter-38263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multitude of political and economic factors</a> — industrial deregulation, the rise of anti-union politicians, increasing globalization — but American workplaces also fundamentally changed. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/09/03/watch-the-u-s-transition-from-a-manufacturing-economy-to-a-service-economy-in-one-gif/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Employment opportunities moved</a> from traditionally organized workplaces, like factories, into a service industry where union density was already lower. Many workers unionizing today are making coffee instead of cars, and issues like high turnover and irregular worker schedules in those industries <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00197939211048484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led to job instability</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://civicscience.com/company-responses-to-employee-unionization-strongly-influence-consumer-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Support for unions today is also divided along partisan lines</a>: Sixty-five percent of Democrats and 43 percent of independents support unions, while a plurality of Republicans (47 percent) oppose them, according to CivicScience. That being said, a majority of Americans think that <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/6/dfp_worker_union_rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether to unionize should be entirely the workers’ choice</a> and that employers should stay neutral.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And despite the partisanship, Americans largely favor the kinds of worker protections and benefits unions fight for. In general, Americans <a href="https://www.bentley.edu/files/gallup/Bentley-Gallup_Force_for_Good_Report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think businesses</a> should treat workers with respect, pay fair wages and provide health care benefits. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/22/most-americans-support-a-15-federal-minimum-wage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sixty-two percent of Americans support</a> a $15 federal minimum wage, and <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/12/01/most-americans-think-minimum-wage-is-too-low" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-quarters of Americans</a> think the current federal minimum wage, $7.25 an hour, is too low. Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2017/03/23/americans-widely-support-paid-family-and-medical-leave-but-differ-over-specific-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly support paid family and medical leave</a>, a sticking point in the rail-worker negotiations. While the pandemic led to <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/09/16/pandemic-prompts-more-states-to-mandate-paid-sick-leave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more states and cities mandating paid sick leave</a> and 79 percent of civilian workers <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/paid-sick-leave-was-available-to-79-percent-of-civilian-workers-in-march-2021.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had paid leave</a> available to them as of March 2021, the workers least likely to have it are the lowest paid. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But all of that <em>general</em> support didn’t carry over to the specific case of the rail workers and their requests for paid sick leave to be included in their contract. CivicScience found that <a href="https://civicscience.com/immediate-insights-more-than-two-thirds-of-americans-approve-of-president-bidens-decision-to-block-rail-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68 percent of Americans</a> approve of Biden blocking the rail strike. A poll from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/qsanp37uhh/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> conducted Dec. 3-6 found that 56 percent of Americans approve of government action to avoid a strike that could harm the American economy, suggesting that supply-chain concerns in the middle of the holiday shopping season might have outweighed sympathy to the rail workers’ demands. But rail workers have warned that more disgruntled employees could <a href="https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-lobbying/3762605-no-paid-sick-leave-could-spur-rail-worker-exodus-that-ripples-across-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bail on an industry that is already understaffed</a>. That has been the overall story of how workers in all kinds of industries have flexed their power in the labor market over the past few years, whether or not they personally have a union to back them up. If conditions and pay at one job <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2022/article/empirical-evidence-for-the-great-resignation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t meet workers’ expectations</a>, many have had <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/07/28/majority-of-u-s-workers-changing-jobs-are-seeing-real-wage-gains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an easier time finding a job that does</a>.</p>



<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>Americans are more likely than citizens of other countries to be wary of social media’s role in politics, according to polling conducted in 19 different nations and recently <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/12/06/social-media-seen-as-mostly-good-for-democracy-across-many-nations-but-u-s-is-a-major-outlier/">published by Pew Research Center</a>. Sixty-four percent of Americans said that social media has had a negative impact on democracy — a percentage higher than that of any other country surveyed, which ranged from 54 percent in the Netherlands down to 15 percent in Poland. Despite their concerns about social media, Americans’ usage has risen over the past ten years: Seventy-two percent of American adults use such sites today, versus just 50 percent in 2012. All in all, this is not so different from places where social media is viewed as less threatening to democracy. Sixty-six percent of Polish citizens, for example, use social media now, up from 40 percent a decade ago. (In 2012, Pew asked the social-media-usage question only of people who first reported they used the internet, whereas in 2022 that question was asked of all respondents.)</li><li>Americans were more confident that their 2022 midterm-election ballot was counted accurately than they were that their 2020 presidential-election ballot was, per Nov. 17-21 polling from <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/a-majority-of-americans-feel-uneasy-about-the-state-of-american-democracy/">Navigator Research</a>. Sixty percent of Americans believed their 2020 ballots were counted correctly and fairly, versus 71 percent who said the same about 2022. The level of confidence reported by Democrats and independents remained virtually the same across the two elections, but the same did not hold true for Republicans: While only 31 percent felt their 2020 ballot was correctly counted, nearly double (58 percent) voiced the same about their 2022 ballot.</li><li>Gun ownership in America varies widely by gender, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/406238/stark-gender-gap-gun-ownership-views-gun-laws.aspx">according to recently released Gallup polling</a>. Just 22 percent of American women reported personally owning a gun, but that rate is nearly double among men (43 percent). Men’s gun ownership levels have remained fairly consistent since 2007, according to annual surveys from Gallup, while the number among women has risen slightly from 13 percent in the organization’s first poll on the matter, conducted in 2007-2008. </li><li>A Nov. 18-22 <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/12/6/a-majority-of-voters-believe-climate-change-will-increase-costs">survey from Data For Progress</a> found that more than two-thirds of Americans (69 percent) were at least somewhat worried climate change will lead to higher consumer prices in the future. High numbers of Democrats were worried about the impact of climate change on prices (82 percent), but 56 percent of Republicans also share these concerns. That said, there’s less consensus on what to do about it. Almost half of Democrats (45 percent), for example, said that renewable energy production will bring down energy costs “a lot,” yet only 12 percent of Republicans were on the same page.</li></ul>

<p data-paragraph="main">ATLANTA — I have a confession to make. My editors tasked me with flying out to Georgia to cover the state’s Senate runoff and asked me to assess what was creating a recent (and seemingly) nonstop cycle of neck-and-neck political contests. But before I even set foot on the plane, I was skeptical that one runoff alone could serve as a crystal ball to predict the state’s political future. Runoffs are their own animal. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yes, I expected <a href="https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/voter-fatigue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voter fatigue</a> — how many runoffs can one state take? But when I landed in Georgia late last week, the state’s voters didn’t seem especially tired. <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/early-voting-in-georgia-ends-with-big-turnout-in-us-senate-runoff/R2CA5PMNYVBH3O7P4ZHSOPTD5Y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There was record early voting</a> and that remained high through Election Day: Turnout in the runoff was 89 percent of the November turnout from last month. On top of that, in-person events for both candidates were packed. “There is excitement here because we want to continue pushing policies that a lot of people, especially young people, find important — like climate change, and canceling student debt, and ensuring women’s reproductive rights,” 20-year-old Shruthi Mohana Sundaram, the president of College Democrats at Georgia Tech, told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the end, Sen. Raphael Warnock prevailed. By a slim margin of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/06/us/elections/results-georgia-us-senate-runoff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 3 percentage points</a>, the incumbent Democrat eked out a win over Republican Herschel Walker in a nail-biter election night. It was another high-profile statewide victory for Democrats, who, during the 2020 election cycle, managed to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/07/warnock-ossoff-flipped-senate-georgia-456310" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flip Georgia’s two Senate seats</a> and win <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-stacey-abrams-georgia-37715b9c1603281df2937333abe2a995" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its 16 electoral votes</a> for the first time <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/politics/joe-biden-wins-georgia/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in almost three decades</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Georgia is a magnet for political attention because the state has become a microcosm of the nation’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense political polarization</a>. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than any other state</a>, it has seen the biggest increase in its share of Black<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined throughout this article as single-race and not Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a><sup> </sup>Americans 18 years or older, and there’s been substantial Democratic growth <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/11/09/what-can-the-2022-midterms-tell-us-about-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs</a>. Mixed into the state, though, are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/abrams-warnock-courting-rural-georgia-voters-republican-terrain-2022-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older, rural, Republican voters</a>, and, arguably, all of those residents come together to personify the diversity of both the state and the nation. This melting pot effect has made the state fertile hunting ground for both political parties. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given Georgia’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/upshot/warnock-ossoff-georgia-victories.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprisingly pivotal</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-georgia-elections-bb997641ca36805c0f53f406a3529d87" target="_blank" rel="noopener">role in the 2020 election</a>, political prognosticators (including my colleagues and I) have spent a lot of time assessing what runoff results mean <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the broader political environment</a>: Is Georgia now purple (or perhaps — if you’re feeling generous to Democrats — periwinkle)? Or, is it a red state — evidenced by every other statewide Republican, save for Walker, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/06/takeaways-georgia-runoff-2022-warnock-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning their election this fall</a> — that, due to the specifics of the last two elections, <em>happens</em> to have two Democratic senators?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The truth — as it so often does in politics — lies between the two narratives. Runoffs are kooky, and Warnock’s victory tells us as much about the importance of candidate quality, turnout and campaign strength as it does about the state’s political future. The state’s hue is likely to vary depending on who’s running, how much money they have and how energized voters feel. Warnock’s second runoff victory is definitely a sign that the state is getting more competitive. Put plainly: Georgia’s statewide Republicans can’t coast here anymore. But Warnock also had some important factors (like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incumbency</a>) working in his favor, and Democrats will need both luck and skill to keep up their winning streak. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This process of becoming a competitive state is two steps forward and one step backward,” said former Gov. Roy Barnes, who held the post from 1999 to 2003 and was the last Democrat to lead the state. “And I think that Georgia is on the march toward being a state in which either side can win depending on the quality of the candidate and the financial backing they have to get their message out.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">I was skeptical about drawing too much of a conclusion about Georgia’s future based on the runoff results, in part because runoffs are really a relic of Georgia’s past. The state law mandating that one candidate surpass the 50 percent vote threshold on the first ballot <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anxiety/episodes/racist-history-georgia-runoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has racist roots</a> and was created as a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/tellingallamericansstories/upload/CivilRights_VotingRights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">means of preserving white political power</a> in a heavily Black state by making it harder for Black candidates to prevail. This effort to suppress the franchise of people of color continued in the lead-up to Tuesday, too: A <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-georgia-93f3ee7ff34e5d6aa2bd96d048832a8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new state law</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-score/2022/11/28/georgia-runoff-by-the-numbers-00070906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly shortened the runoff campaign period</a>, despite research showing that a shortened early voting window <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/impact-voter-suppression-communities-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adversely affects voters of color</a>. Moreover, state officials and Republican groups <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-11-23/georgia-high-court-allows-saturday-voting-for-senate-runoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to argue</a> that a section of Georgia law prohibited early voting the Saturday after Thanksgiving. (Democrats <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/win-democrats-georgia-judge-allows-early-voting-senate-runoff-saturday-rcna57983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a court challenge</a> blocking the effort). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So runoffs already carry a lot of baggage — and for years, Republicans overwhelmingly prevailed when they happened. But Georgia is getting more competitive for Democrats, in part <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to demographic changes</a>. It’s just not clear <em>how</em> competitive. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you look back through the last few election cycles, Republican governor and presidential nominees normally won with about 51 to 53 percent of the vote. That has pretty much stayed consistent,” said Kaaryn Walker, a GOP consultant in Atlanta and founder of Black Conservatives for Truth. “All that’s to say is that we are a red-purple state, we’re not one of those dark-red states where Republicans are consistently winning by double-digits.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As the chart above shows, Democrats <em>have</em> made gains in some statewide races over the past few cycles — and Republicans have found it more difficult to win. For most Senate and presidential contests that took place between 1998 and 2016, Republicans easily won their elections — oftentimes by double-digit margins.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Senate 2008 general election went to a runoff after then-incumbent Sen. Saxby Chambliss only earned 49.8 percent of the vote compared to Democrat Jim Martin’s 46.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> That changed during the 2020 cycle when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/politics/joe-biden-wins-georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden carried Georgia</a> and Warnock and now-Sen. Jon Ossoff <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly defeated</a> their opponents.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special election involving Warnock featured a jungle primary in the November election when multiple candidates from the same party ran. The combined Republican vote narrowly led the combined Democratic vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> This year, Warnock emerged victorious again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Partisans, including ones I spoke with for this story, will tell you a simplified story about Georgia’s politics, often spinning facts about the state’s political leanings to fit a certain political narrative. But the problem is that two things can be true at once: Georgia is getting more competitive, and it’s also still quite red.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example: Democrats haven’t narrowed the margins everywhere — especially in governor’s races. Since the 2000s, Republicans have dominated the state’s executive office and have often won those seats by high single-digit margins. That wasn’t the case in 2018, when Republican Brian Kemp eked out a 1-percentage-point win over Democrat Stacey Abrams for the open governor’s seat. But there were other factors at play that year — including the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/21/2018-midterms-republicans-trump-warning-312404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presence of former President Donald Trump</a> in the White House — and this year reverted back to the status quo. Kemp, now an incumbent, sailed to reelection last month, beating Abrams by roughly 7 percentage points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, Walker’s showing on the first ballot and the subsequent runoff was a historic outlier. He was the only statewide Republican to <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/11/10/republicans-sweep-georgia-state-offices-retain-legislature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not win outright</a> in November, and on top of that, his vote share was the lowest of any Georgia GOP candidate in a Senate, governor or presidential race since 2000.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding jungle primary results, when more than one Republican was on the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Walker did have his fans. William P.,<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William declined to give his last name because he wanted to protect his privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a> a 79-year-old retiree who I met at a Walker campaign event at the Governors Gun Club in Kennesaw, Georgia, early Monday evening said he’s followed Walker’s career trajectory since his football days. “If he was running for president, I’d vote for him,” William said. “I mean, why not? He stands out. What he’s saying makes sense. He’s not going to kiss up to anybody.” But that sentiment wasn’t shared among all Republicans. The state’s Republican lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, who <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/georgia-runoff-election-walker-warnock-geoff-duncan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not seek reelection</a> this year, made headlines for saying he <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/why-geoff-duncan-didnt-cast-a-ballot-in-the-senate-runoff/I5QYKFVZHZDG7OGLZ5GPIHC5QU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t vote for either candidate</a> in this year’s runoff election. He also called Walker “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/03/herschel-walker-georgia-runoff-geoff-duncan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the worst candidates</a>” in GOP history.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That particular claim might be hard to prove — but Walker was definitely a flawed candidate. Prior to November, he was beset with <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/4/23387712/herschel-walker-georgia-senate-raphael-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous controversies</a>, including allegations that he encouraged and/or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-woman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid for multiple women</a> to terminate their pregnancies (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/herschel-walker-denies-new-abortion-allegation-rcna54205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which Walker denies</a>), despite once campaigning on a platform that included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a total ban on abortions</a>. And in the lead-up to Tuesday, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/politics/kfile-herschel-walker-texas-tax-break-georgia-runoff/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN reported</a> that Walker is receiving a tax exemption on his home in Texas meant for primary residents of the state, while running for Senate in Georgia. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1445522139-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1445522139-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1445522139-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1445522139-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker told Georgians that a vote for him was a vote against President Biden. But his case for himself felt curiously empty.</figcaption></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">So one takeaway from this race has nothing to do with the fundamental makeup of Georgia. It’s simply that parties need to avoid nominating problematic candidates. “I think it’s fair to say that both political parties in Georgia are going to see more vetting of candidates for major races going into the future,” said Mark Rountree, the president of Landmark Communications, Inc., a political consulting and polling firm based out of Georgia. “There were a lot of congressmen and other candidates who have already been vetted in previous campaigns, who could’ve run and had fewer issues than Walker.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And campaigns matter too. Walker had the bad fortune to go up against Warnock, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/politics/cnn-poll-georgia-senate-runoff-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a relatively popular incumbent</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0GA00559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fundraising behemoth</a>. In fact, Warnock had so much money that he was able to spend it reaching out to voters in parts of the state that would normally never even consider voting for a Democrat. Selden Deemer of Lumpkin County, a rare Democratic-leaning independent who cast a ballot for both Warnock and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in the general election, said he received more Warnock mailers than Walker mailers in the lead-up to the runoff. And Lumpkin County, he said, feels very far from the safely blue Democratic enclaves like Fulton, Cobb, Gwinnett and DeKalb counties. “A bear ran off with our trash can once, so it’s a very different experience from Atlanta,” he said. A more relevant — but less ursine — difference is that unlike the counties surrounding Atlanta, former President Trump won Lumpkin County by large margins in 2016 and 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in a state where turnout is the defining factor in close races, Warnock’s message may have been more compelling. I was struck by the differences in how the two candidates interacted with voters: At the Students for Warnock rally, the pastor gave an energizing 25-minute speech in which he ticked off a list of congressional accomplishments that he said would’ve been impossible without the support of young people — including his own election to Congress. “I want you to vote like it’s an emergency,” he said. “Vote like health care depends on it, vote like a women’s right to choose depends on it — because it does.” Walker, meanwhile, let his surrogates do a lot of the talking for him. In fact, his own speech at one of the last stops on his “Evict Warnock Bus Tour” capped at just about 6 minutes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Standing in the audience at each event, it was striking to hear the candidates make their pitch. Sure, both men were steadfast about framing a win for them as existential in nature: A vote for Warnock went toward preserving democratic values, while a vote for Walker gave voters a ticket to place checks on Biden. But in a political world in which every election is presented like the end of days are upon us, it <em>did </em>feel like Warnock’s speech was more tailored to his chosen audience, while Walker’s had less heft. The former football star took a common tack, framing the race in national terms: “A vote for my opponent is a vote for Joe Biden and a vote for Chuck Schumer.” But his pitch for himself was curiously empty — a vote for Walker, for example, said nothing about the GOP’s standard bearer, Trump. “A vote for me is a vote for Georgia values,” he said. But he didn’t elaborate on what those values actually were.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this left me with the inescapable conclusion that Georgia just can’t be colored with a single political dye — at least not yet. Everyone still wants to answer that pesky question: Is Georgia red? Purple? Indigo? Violet? Periwinkle? The real answer is probably “all of the above.” It’s hard to pinpoint exactly which factors were most responsible for Warnock’s win, but they don’t seem to have been present in any of Georgia’s other statewide races. In short, Warnock’s victory is more proof that Georgia <em>can</em> go blue. But whether it <em>will</em> go blue in the future remains to be seen. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">I’m not that impressed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term projections of Democratic doom in the Senate</a>. Mostly that’s because I’m not that impressed by long-term political projections in general. Political coalitions change; not many people would have had it on their bingo card that Democrats would obtain a Senate majority in 2020 by winning two runoffs in Georgia, and then would actually <em>expand</em> on that majority in 2022 <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/georgia-senate-warnock-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following another runoff in Georgia</a> despite their party controlling the White House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that said, while I don’t think we can say very much about what politics will look like 10 or 20 years from now, a <em>medium-term</em> look-ahead is possible. Do Democrats have a reasonable hope of regaining a trifecta — control of the House, Senate and presidency — at any point in the near future (2024, 2026 or 2028)? And how long will they hold onto control of the Senate and the presidency, allowing them to appoint Supreme Court justices without Republican help?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">My colleague Geoffrey Skelley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-senate-2024-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already took an initial look at the 2024 Senate map</a>, which is bad for Democrats, but I wanted to dig slightly deeper and also consider 2026 and 2028. Like Geoffrey, I’ll be focused on the Senate, because that’s the weakest link in Democrats’ effort to win back the trifecta. Despite some disadvantages in the Electoral College, Democrats obviously have no trouble winning the presidency. And they nearly held onto the House this year despite losing the popular vote for the House. The current House map <a href="https://decisiondeskhq.com/the-us-house-was-biased-toward-democrats-in-2022-why-republicans-are-developing-a-geography-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t have much — if any — of a Republican skew</a>, and Democrats should be able to win back the House if the national political environment is reasonably good for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s look at the 2024, 2026 and 2028 Senate maps (yes, 2028 features the same map as the midterm we <em>just</em> finished; I just can’t let go, I guess). We’ll classify races into bronze, silver, gold and platinum “tiers” in terms of how feasible they are as pickup opportunities. I’m deliberately using this goofy metallurgical theme as opposed to the categories FiveThirtyEight typically uses (e.g., “toss-up,” “lean Republican”) so you’ll recognize these as being back-of-the-envelope suppositions rather than any sort of official race ratings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In general, these ratings lean heavily on looking at how close a race was the last time it was contested, with some subjective adjustments for candidate quality. I’m also considering how the electoral environment has shifted within the state — Florida has gotten redder since Rick Scott was elected in 2018, for instance — although it is definitely <em>not</em> always safe to assume a state will continue trending in the same direction.</p>



<h2><strong>2024</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Republican pickup opportunities</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier: </em>West Virginia (Manchin), Montana (Tester), Ohio (Brown), </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> Arizona (Sinema), Nevada (Rosen)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> Wisconsin (Baldwin), Michigan (Stabenow), Pennsylvania (Casey)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> New Jersey (Menendez), Virginia (Kaine)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Geoffrey noted, the platinum-tier states listed here are the Democrats’ main problem. They have three senators up for reelection in states that Donald Trump carried by 8 (Ohio), 16 (Montana) and 39 (West Virginia!) percentage points in 2020. Each of those Democratic senators won reelection in 2018, of course, but that was a strong Democratic year, and there’s been further movement of white voters without college degrees — a key part of the electorate in these states — toward Republicans since then. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I don’t want to focus too much on any one individual race, but it’s probably safe to assume that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/10/senator-manchin-approval-rating-drops-west-virginia-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Manchin has the toughest reelection campaign of all</a>. Meanwhile, maybe Sherrod Brown can feel a bit more comfortable following Tim Ryan’s relatively good performance in Ohio this year, but Ryan did lose, and Brown may face a tougher opponent than Ryan did in J.D. Vance. Democrats also run the risk of retirements here; neither Manchin nor Jon Tester has officially yet announced they will seek reelection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond the platinum tier, Democrats face some other risks. Kyrsten Sinema is <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/168804/ruben-gallego-says-kyrsten-sinema-only-cares-herself-nothing-help-arizona-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely to face a serious primary challenge</a>. Democrats keep winning close races for Congress in Nevada but it’s a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nevada-could-be-senate-republicans-ace-in-the-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very purple state</a>. Tammy Baldwin, Debbie Stabenow and Bob Casey won by fairly comfortable margins in 2018 and will likely be fine in the event of a decent-to-good Democratic year, but if 2024 turns into a good Republican year, they could be in trouble.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Democratic pickup opportunities</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> Texas (Cruz), Florida (Scott)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conversely, it’s very slim pickings for Democrats. On paper, you’d think that Texas might be close — Ted Cruz won by less than 3 percentage points there in 2018 and Texas is more competitive than it once was — but the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-republican-gains-in-south-texas-win-them-more-house-seats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">erosion of the Democratic vote in South Texas</a> has prevented Texas from turning truly purple. And although Scott won by only 0.12 percentage points in 2018, Republicans did so well in Florida in 2020 and 2022 that I was tempted to demote his race all the way to the bronze tier. Plus, there’s a good chance that the GOP’s 2024 nominee will be either Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or Florida resident Donald Trump, which could help drive Republican turnout.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond that, any other races look like an extreme stretch for Democrats. Maybe Josh Hawley in Missouri could be vulnerable in a 2018-type environment, but that’s less likely in a presidential year and Hawley’s approval rating <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=79454b16-49f5-4cb0-9e32-bf3e045acc6d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t that bad</a>. Put him in the “honorable mention” tier, I guess.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given all this, I’d imagine the modal outcome from 2024 is something like Republicans picking up about three Senate seats. There’s uncertainty around that; it’s surely within the realm of possibility that Democrats hold the Senate, but it’s also possible that Republicans could wind up with 54 or 55 seats. And of course, all of these races are correlated. If the GOP is doing well enough to win the presidency in 2024, they should have no trouble also winning the Senate.<a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And keep in mind in that case that the GOP would only need one pickup to control the Senate since they’d have the vice president’s tiebreaking vote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a></p>



<h2><strong>2026</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Republican pickup opportunities </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier: </em>Georgia (Ossoff), Michigan (Peters)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> New Hampshire (Shaheen)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> Minnesota (Smith), Virginia (Warner)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2026 map is more balanced. Democrats undoubtedly feel pretty good about how they’ve performed in Georgia and Michigan in the past two cycles, but Jon Ossoff and Gary Peters won by extremely narrow margins in 2020 and it would be a mistake to assume they’re safe. It’s not a particularly deep set of pickup opportunities for Republicans, though if Democrats retain the presidency in 2024, you’d expect Republicans to have good midterms in 2026, and New Hampshire and perhaps even Minnesota and Virginia could potentially be in play. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Democratic pickup opportunities </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> Maine (Collins), North Carolina (Tillis)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> Alaska (Sullivan)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> Texas (Cornyn), Iowa (Ernst)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democrats will try again in the two states that were most disappointing to them in 2020: Maine and North Carolina. Given all the focus on Georgia, I wonder if North Carolina hasn’t become underrated as a place where Democrats could gain ground in the future; the states are fairly similar demographically and it wouldn’t take that much of a shift for Democrats to go from narrowly losing races in North Carolina to narrowly winning them. Susan Collins will be 74 years old in 2026, meanwhile, an age at which there’s typically some chance of retirement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats also have a below-the-radar pickup opportunity in Alaska, where Mary Peltola was elected to a full term in the U.S. House<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peltola had previously won a special election earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>32</sup></a> last month by a 10-point margin after ranked-choice votes were tabulated. GOP incumbent Dan Sullivan has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-every-senator-and-governor-ranks-according-to-popularity-above-replacement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mediocre approval rating</a> and a Peltola-Sullivan race would potentially be competitive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Suppose, though, that Democrats win the presidency but lose the Senate in 2024. It’s really not as crazy as it sounds. If every state votes identically to how it did in the 2020 presidential election — and every Senate race follows the presidential vote — then Democrats would come out of 2024 with the presidency but only 48 Senate seats after losing West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. Could Democrats pick up two Senate seats from the GOP in the 2026 midterm while controlling the presidency? Unlikely — but then again, Democrats gaining Senate seats this year seemed unlikely and they did it.</p>



<h2><strong>2028</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Republican pickup opportunities</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> Nevada (Cortez Masto), Pennsylvania (Fetterman), Arizona (Kelly), Georgia (Warnock) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier:</em> New Hampshire (Hassan)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier: </em>Oregon (Wyden)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All right, now we’re literally coming full circle to consider the races that were just contested in last month’s midterm. So we’ll keep it pretty brief. Yes, Democrats have to feel pretty good about their wins in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia — especially given that the overall political environment <em>wasn’t</em> that great for Democrats this year. But they were <em>narrow</em> wins, and (with the possible exception of Nevada) they came against a mediocre set of GOP opponents. Maybe some of these races are toward the silver end of the gold tier, but more likely than not they’ll be competitive again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And since we’re projecting a full six years out, I’m going to be a little bit more creative about considering long-shot opportunities in the bronze tier. Although the Senate races in Washington and Colorado received attention this year (Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/02/gop-spending-colorado-washington-senate-00049108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent a lot of money on both, only to lose by double digits</a>), they wound up coming just as close in Oregon with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/oregon-senate-perkins-qanon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAnon candidate</a> as part of a comparatively strong year for the GOP in the Beaver State. Could a more mainstream GOP nominee have made it a race? Oregon is quite white, it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_educational_attainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer people with college degrees</a> than the “Portlandia” stereotype might make you assume, and Democratic incumbent Ron Wyden will be 79 years old in 2028 …</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Democratic pickup opportunities</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Platinum tier:</em> None</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Gold tier:</em> Wisconsin (Johnson), North Carolina (Budd)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Silver tier: </em>Vance (Ohio)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Bronze tier:</em> Alaska (Murkowski), Florida (Rubio), Utah (Lee), Iowa (Grassley)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, we’re mostly just rehashing this year’s map. Ron Johnson, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/09/ron-johnson-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally hadn’t planned on running in 2020</a>, is another retirement threat in 2026 — and he barely won reelection anyway. In Ohio, Sherrod Brown could seek to return to the Senate if he loses in 2024 by challenging J.D. Vance. And 2028 is far enough from now that I wouldn’t want to rule out Democrats being competitive in states as far-flung as Utah, where independent Evan McMullin ran a fairly competitive race against Mike Lee this year.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even with an additional senator going into 2023, the 2024 map is still so bad for Democrats that keeping the Senate for years to come will be a fairly tough order. The party’s prospects might rest more upon limiting the damage in 2024 so that it has a chance to regain the Senate in 2026 or 2028. But a bad 2024 could make it very difficult for Democrats to regain the Senate before 2030 or 2032.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That bleak picture may shape the next few years of political maneuvering. When Vox’s Dylan Matthews <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanmatt/status/1590743015379062784?s=20&amp;t=eK3Zz1VKZ2Pu2fezgnxA4g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested on Twitter</a> that liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor (age 68) and Elena Kagan (age 62) should retire while Democrats have their Senate majority and be replaced by younger justices, it didn’t go over well. But it’s a perfectly rational suggestion if Democrats don’t feel like gambling with their judicial future. (Consider how consequential Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s decision <em>not</em> to retire has been for liberals.) Democrats have a narrow path to Senate control after 2024, but it’s narrow indeed, and one that might require the GOP continuing to nominate bad candidates — and a fair share of luck.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 midterms have come to an end with Sen. Raphael Warnock beating Herschel Walker in the Senate runoff in Georgia. At the time of recording this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a> on Wednesday morning, Warnock had an almost 3-point lead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That lead could grow slightly as the tallying is finalized, but, while it was a competitive race, it was not ultimately a nail biter. The crew takes a look at how this election compares with the one in November and past runoffs. They also discuss what it can tell us about Georgia’s politics going forward and what it means for Trump’s influence in the Republican party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In a bit of electoral déjà vu, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock won Georgia’s runoff on Tuesday, almost two years after he <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a special election runoff</a> to help hand Democrats a narrow 50-50 majority in the Senate via Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote. This time around, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgia-2022-midterm-election-results/story?id=92009770#senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warnock topped Republican Herschel Walker</a> to earn a full six-year term, which will have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/difference-51-seat-senate-democratic-majority-make/story?id=93278188" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major ramifications</a> for how the new Senate will conduct business in January. Warnock’s win gives Democrats 51 seats — including independent Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont — so the Democratic caucus will no longer have to constantly rely on Harris to break ties. Democrats will also now have majorities on each committee and will be able to more easily confirm President Biden’s judicial appointments.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet if we look even further into the future, it turns out the Georgia outcome could also play a role in deciding which party controls the Senate after the <em>next</em> election. The good news for Democrats is that they will have 51 seats instead of 50, which gives them a chance to maintain control even if they lose one seat, depending on whether the next vice president is a Democrat or Republican. The good news for Republicans, however, is that the 2024 Senate map puts them in a better position to take control of the chamber than it does for Democrats to hold onto it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have more than twice as many Senate seats to defend in 2024 as Republicans, an imbalance that gives the GOP a clear path to capturing the Senate — even if the Georgia result has given Democrats a little breathing room. At present, 34 Senate seats will be up for election,<a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate’s 100 seats are divided into three groups called classes. The 33 seats in &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_I.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class I&lt;/a&gt; are due up for election in 2024, and Nebraska’s &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_II.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class II seat&lt;/a&gt; will also be on the ballot because Republican Sen. Ben Sasse &lt;a href="https://www.3newsnow.com/news/local-news/sen-ben-sasse-to-resign-january-8-pillen-to-officially-pick-his-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;will resign in early 2023&lt;/a&gt; to become president of the University of Florida. The seat &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/03/jockeying-to-replace-sasse-locked-up-00064740" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;will remain in Republican hands&lt;/a&gt; after Sasse’s resignation, as the incoming governor, a Republican, is expected to appoint a Republican to the seat, but Nebraska will also hold a special election for it in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>33</sup></a> and of those, Democrats (including the independent senators who caucus with them) hold 23 to the GOP’s 11, as the table below shows.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That Democrats have so many seats to defend in 2024 is a byproduct of past electoral success. Each <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/senate-class-population-imbalance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class of Senate seats</a> is up every six years,<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a vacancy occurs that necessitates a special election before that six-year mark. Regardless, a seat due up in, say, 2024 will be up again in 2030 even if there’s an intervening special election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> so the group of seats up in 2024 was previously up in 2018 and each six-year mark prior to that. <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1994&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 1994</a>, Republicans enjoyed a wave election in which they gained eight Senate seats. But ever since, Democrats have developed a sizable advantage among this batch of seats: <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2000&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2000</a>, Democrats gained four seats amid a razor-tight presidential election; <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2006</a>, they gained six seats thanks to a midterm Democratic wave;<a data-footnote-id="35" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-35" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s if you still include Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as a Democrat (otherwise, it’s five). Lieberman won reelection as an independent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2006/08/09/5629128/lieberman-loses-connecticut-senate-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;after losing the Democratic primary&lt;/a&gt;, but continued &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-113sdoc11/pdf/CDOC-113sdoc11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;to caucus with his old party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2012&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2012</a>, Democrats gained two more thanks to upset wins in North Dakota and Indiana; and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2018&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2018</a>, they <em>lost</em> two net seats but managed to pick up a seat in increasingly competitive Arizona while avoiding more sizable losses by holding onto seats in Montana, Ohio and West Virginia.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-voted-protect-abortion-rights-midterms-fivethirtyeight-94370127</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But as a result, Democrats now must defend the now red-leaning seats of Sens. Jon Tester of Montana, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. All three won reelection in 2018, but those elections took place in a heavily <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/?states=PR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic-leaning environment</a> that they can’t count on having again in 2024. In addition to those three redder seats, Republicans will surely also target swing-state seats in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though Republicans have ample pickup opportunities, Democrats can realistically hope to flip only two GOP-held seats in 2024: Florida and Texas. Still, given the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-house-election-margin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong Republican showings in Florida recently</a> and the inability of Texas Democrats to break through statewide, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even as the state has become a lighter shade of red</a>, the GOP incumbents will likely start as favorites in these seats in a way that isn’t true for Brown, Manchin and Tester.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looming over each of these Senate contests is the presidential race that will undoubtedly influence down-ballot outcomes. In recent years, the party that carries a state in the presidential contest has usually won its Senate race. In 2020, just one of 35 Senate races went for a different party from the one that carried the state in the presidential election (Maine), while in 2016 all 34 Senate elections went for the same party that carried the state at the presidential level, as the chart below shows.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Most states vote for the same party for president and Senate" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9Tm2Q/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" data-external="1" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, in the next Congress, just five senators<a data-footnote-id="36" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-36" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we include King and Sanders as Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>36</sup></a> out of 100 will occupy seats in states that the other party’s presidential candidate carried in 2020 — and three of them are the red-state Democratic trio up in 2024. In other words, Republicans stand to benefit if the party’s presidential nominee can persuade some voters not to split their ticket in 2024 and vote for a GOP senator as well. Considering how red West Virginia and Montana are today, such a shift could be enough for Republicans to flip those two seats and win the Senate even if the GOP loses the presidency, should the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pool of split-ticket voters</a> shrink <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-midterm-voters-backed-different-parties-for-senate-and-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even further</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Georgia’s runoff in the rearview mirror, the 2024 election cycle can truly begin. And while the Democrats’ victory in the Peach State has helped give them a bit of wiggle room in the Senate, the overall map remains favorable to Republicans. To hold onto the Senate, Democrats need a lot of things to go right in 2024. While the 2022 midterm result showed how that can happen, Democrats will probably have to retain at least a couple of seats that are redder than any they had to defend this year — a difficult task in a world with fewer split-ticket outcomes between presidential and Senate voting.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The Georgia runoff is upon us! Today, the last U.S. Senate election of 2022 will finally be decided. And according to the polls, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is slightly ahead of Republican Herschel Walker — but the election is still very close.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">During the <a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/115465/web.307039/#/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nov. 8</a> general election, Warnock received 49.4 percent of the vote and Walker 48.5 percent. Although other Georgia Republicans won their races comfortably, Warnock’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/all-you-need-to-know-about-georgias-senate-race-through-tv-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advertising</a> and <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/10/06/warnock-walker-ride-eye-popping-fundraising-totals-into-georgias-senate-election-homestretch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising</a> prowess and Walker’s many <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/herschel-walker-responds-to-attack-ad-that-used-ex-wifes-accusations-of-domestic-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandals</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversies</a> helped send this race to a runoff. (Georgia is one of the few states that requires runoff elections when neither candidate gets a majority of the vote in the general election.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We aren’t issuing a forecast for this runoff as we did for the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general election</a>, but we <em>have</em> calculated a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a>. And as of Monday at 4 p.m. Eastern, Warnock was averaging 50.2 percent support, and Walker was averaging 48.2 percent. Again, this isn’t a prediction of the final results, just a summary of the polls conducted of the runoff.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1632" height="890" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png?w=1424 2x"></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">The polls in Georgia ahead of November’s election were pretty accurate. In our final polling average of the state’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election for governor</a>, Republican incumbent Brian Kemp led by 7.9 percentage points. He then won the election by 7.5. And in our final polling average of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Senate general election</a>, Walker led by 1.0 point, which was 2.0 points off the actual election result. Although the polls had the wrong candidate in the lead, they were mathematically quite close to the actual margin. Polls are meant only to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-read-2020-polls-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximate the final result</a>, not predict winners.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, of course, Warnock’s 1.9-point polling lead is not ironclad. Although most of the nine runoff polls give Warnock the lead, every single one has been within the margin of error. (Because margin of error applies to each candidate’s vote share, a candidate’s lead has to be almost twice as large<a data-footnote-id="36" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-36" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.6 times, to be precise, for &lt;a href="https://www.danvk.org/wp/2008-09-25/how-to-read-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;complicated mathematical reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>36</sup></a> as the margin of error to be statistically significant.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, a few of these polls have been from pollsters without established track records. That doesn’t mean they will be inaccurate, but it is a reason to take them with a grain of salt. For example, Phillips Academy just started polling this year, so they don’t have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight pollster rating</a>, our assessment of how accurate and methodologically sound pollsters are.<a data-footnote-id="37" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-37" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our pollster ratings look at polls conducted in the final 21 days of presidential primary elections as well as general elections for president, governor, U.S. Senate and House since 1998, including polls of special elections and runoffs for these offices. If a pollster has no polls that meet those criteria, it doesn’t get a pollster rating. Because we last updated our pollster ratings &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, new pollsters since then (like Phillips Academy) don’t have ratings yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>37</sup></a> The same is true for Patriot Polling, which only surveys people via landline telephone (not cell phones), a methodological red flag. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, Frederick Polls is a Democratic pollster that rarely releases public surveys. From 1998 to 2020, it released only seven polls that qualified for pollster-rating consideration, earning them only a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/frederick-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provisional grade of B/C</a>. Finally, we’ve analyzed 20 polls from Impact Research (under its former name, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/alg-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ALG Research</a>), but only four from <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/fabrizio-lee-associates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates</a>. Moreover, the two organizations’ partnership is new this cycle, so we haven’t had a chance to judge how accurate their polling is in combination.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">However, five surveys from more established pollsters (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/emerson-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/opinion-savvy-insideradvantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InsiderAdvantage</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/ssrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSRS,</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/surveyusa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyUSA</a><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/emerson-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> and the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/university-of-massachusetts-lowell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Massachusetts Lowell</a>) all consistently put Warnock a few points ahead of Walker. That said, it wouldn’t be shocking to see an unexpectedly strong performance from either of the candidates. Other factors agree with the polling that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-either-candidate-could-win-georgias-senate-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this race is tight</a>, and Warnock’s polling lead is still smaller than the average polling error in U.S. Senate races since 1998.<a data-footnote-id="38" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-38" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.4 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>38</sup></a> While Warnock may be better positioned than Walker, either candidate could still win.</p>
