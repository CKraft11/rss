<p data-paragraph="main">In September 2017, Hurricane Irma swept across the southern tip of Florida, swamping what was then the state’s 26th Congressional District. The following July, that district’s Republican representative, Carlos Curbelo, introduced a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill that would tax greenhouse-gas emissions</a> to help reduce the impact of climate change on his hurricane-prone constituency. Curbelo’s party affiliation raised eyebrows at the time, but for him, the threat of recurrent disasters sent political partisanship out the window. “This is not an academic discussion for those of us who live in South Florida. This is a local issue,” he <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/republican-carlos-curbelo-ready-unite-congress-against-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Audubon magazine</a> in 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And he’s not alone. Today, although <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/climate-deniers-117th-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some one-quarter of elected officials</a> walking the halls of Congress don’t believe human-caused climate change is even real, research suggests that politicians can be persuaded to take action on climate change and other environmental issues. Unfortunately, it might take a headline-grabbing hurricane to do it. In the past decade, several studies have suggested that lawmakers are more likely to take action on climate change when they — and their constituents — have had to deal with the disastrous consequences of previously doing nothing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1969 Cuyahoga River fire</a> that led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency to the 1990 Oil Pollution Act that was born out of a series of oil spills, most notably from the Exxon Valdez, a long history of environmental disasters have inspired improvements in environmental policy, said M. Daniele Paserman, an economist at Boston University. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Disasters make environmental problems more salient,” he said. Paserman’s research has found that, between 1989 and 2014, congresspeople from districts hit by a hurricane were more likely to <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25835/w25835.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sponsor or co-sponsor environmental regulatory bills</a> in the following year. And he’s not the only one who has noticed similar correlations. According to another study, which looked at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069614000758?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abnormal temperature and precipitation trends</a> between 2004 and 2011, members of Congress whose home states were experiencing weird weather were more likely to vote for all kinds of environmental legislation. More broadly, international research from 34 countries found that nuclear disasters increased the number of <a href="https://energsustainsoc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13705-020-00256-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewable-energy policies</a> implemented for as long as seven years after the event. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This line of research is relatively new and the number of studies relatively thin. But all of this builds on a larger question that has been studied more in depth: how personally experiencing the effects of climate change shape belief and behavior in the general public. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A 2021 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8284052/#:~:text=Does%20Personal%20Experience%20Shape%20Climate,2014%3B%20Howe%2C%202018)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">review of existing literature</a> discovered ample evidence that living through a natural disaster is associated with higher levels of self-reported belief that climate change is a problem and a greater concern about what this might do to you and your family. Our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own polling with Ipsos earlier this month</a> showed something similar. Even among Republicans, nearly half of those who had experienced an extreme weather event in the past five years told us they were worried about climate change, compared with only 17 percent who hadn’t experienced a natural disaster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there are limits to the ability of a disaster to prevent future calamities. For one thing, the same review paper that showed increased belief in climate change didn’t find a corresponding increase in behaviors that would deal with that issue. And changes in belief are still heavily moderated by what people already think. For example, in a 2019 survey of people who experienced severe flooding in the United Kingdom during the winter of 2013-14, the ones who walked away with the highest levels of concern about climate change were those who had <a href="https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/116789/1/Demski.%20Attribution%20matters.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already attributed floods to global warming</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, it probably shouldn’t be a shock that the much smaller number of papers looking at how politicians might change <em>their</em> behavior in the face of climate change comes with its own set of caveats and complications. Studies have indicated that <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/21/1/23/95076/Silver-Lining-to-Extreme-Weather-Events-Democracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only countries with strong democracies</a> see an increase in climate policy following climate disasters. And Paserman’s study found that the effects were tightly linked to proximity to the disaster. Even lawmakers who served in the same state where a hurricane occurred but whose districts were unaffected weren’t as likely to step up for political change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while that paper found that politicians who experienced climate disasters were more likely to push for climate policies regardless of party, a different study — the one that showed abnormal temperature and precipitation trends were correlated with representatives’ environmental votes — found that party did matter. Moderate Democrats made the biggest shift toward more environmental-policy support, said Erich Muehlegger, an economist at the University of California, Davis, and an author on that paper. “We didn’t find much of a result for Republicans, nor did we find much of a result for the more strident Democrats, though that might be due to the fact that they were always voting for environmental regulations,” he said. “You can’t become more pro-environment if you were already on top of all those issues.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s going to take a lot more research to fully understand why politicians sometimes change their policy in the face of climate disaster and sometimes don’t. Meanwhile, just because lawmakers are responding to natural disasters with environmental votes doesn’t mean they aren’t seeing other, seedier kinds of legislative opportunities from the same event. Ethan Kaplan, an economist at University of Maryland, College Park, and his colleagues found that politicians are likely to use the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster to push through votes favoring the concerns of special-interest donors <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/191433/1/cesifo1_wp7408.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when nobody is paying attention</a>. That’s not a contradiction to the idea that disaster could prompt politicians to take action on climate change. Instead, Kaplan said, the two things can run parallel. A disaster can create a distraction for donors’ goals in the short term, even as it prompts greater environmental policies in the long run. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-still-do-not-show-a-gop-bounce-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that there weren’t yet clear signs of a Republican comeback in polls of the midterm elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This week? The case for a GOP rebound is a little better.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one, Republicans can cite some individual polls that have been favorable for them. There was a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-struggles-party-democrats-2024-poll/story?id=90427262" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> this weekend from ABC News<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight is owned and operated by ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> and the Washington Post, which found Republicans 5 points ahead on the generic congressional ballot among likely voters — a result which would all but assure the GOP of winning the House and make the Senate an uphill battle for Democrats. Republican candidates have also pretty clearly gained ground in some individual Senate races, such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are counterexamples, though. Another <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly rated pollster</a>, Selzer &amp; Co., published a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/Selzer_Grinnell_Sept22_Toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> this week showing Democrats 4 points ahead on the generic ballot among likely voters. Meanwhile, Democrats can cite a few strong recent Senate polls of their own in states such as <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2022/09/27/exclusive-spectrum-news-siena-college-poll-shows-tight-ohio-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, Democrats’ chances of winning the Senate are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68-in-100</a>, according to the Deluxe version of our forecast. That’s down from a high of 71-in-100, which persisted from Sept. 13 to Sept. 20, though that change isn’t large in the big scheme of things. In the House, Democrats’ chances are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">31-in-100</a>, which reflects an even smaller change; their chances were 32-in-100 on Sept. 23 and 24.</p>

So here are five major reasons for hope for the GOP — and concern for Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As an added twist, we’ll engage in a bit of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/model-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model talk</a> as we review these reasons. That is, I’ll tell you whether I think these reasons for hope/concern (depending on who you’re rooting for) are adequately accounted for by our model — or whether they reflect information outside of its scope and assumptions.</p>



<h2><strong>The fundamentals still ought to be pretty good for Republicans</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, this election <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>could</em> be an exception</a> to the usual midterm pushback against the president’s party. But, it’s not always smart to bet on exceptions. So it’s worth going back over the reasons why I and other analysts<em> initially</em> expected this election to be a strong one for Republicans. </p>



<ul><li>The opposition party — in this case, Republicans — has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/">long history</a> of doing well in the midterms. It’s one of the more robust trends in American politics.</li><li>Though his numbers have improved recently, President Biden remains <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">fairly unpopular</a>, with an approval rating of 42 percent.</li><li>Americans remain <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html">quite unhappy</a> about the direction of the country, which tends to hurt the incumbent party.</li><li>Republicans have a big structural advantage in the Senate given that they do well with white, rural voters and that white rural voters are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/">considerably overrepresented in the Senate</a> relative to their overall share of the U.S. population.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this?</strong> Yes. The Classic and Deluxe versions of our model use a blend of polls and fundamentals when evaluating the overall political environment and individual races.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Deluxe version &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; uses expert ratings, in addition to polls and fundamentals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This makes a pretty big difference in the House, where our Lite forecast, which tries to predict the race based on polls alone, gives Republicans a 61-in-100 chance of a House takeover. Those odds jump to 68-in-100 percent in the Deluxe forecast, which takes fundamentals into account. This also boosts the odds of Republicans, who have a 23-in-100 chance of winning the Senate in Lite but a 32-in-100 chance in Deluxe.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The differences between the forecasts were larger at earlier points in the cycle; there isn’t as much time left now for the polls to converge toward the fundamentals. Still, the model assumes that Republicans are more likely to gain ground than to lose ground in the polls between now and November.</p>



<h2><strong>The “issue environment” could get better for Republicans</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/upshot/republicans-midterm-elections.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argument</a> recently advanced by Nate Cohn of The New York Times. During the summer, Democrats benefited from media and voter attention to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Jan. 6 hearings, and the FBI investigation of former President Donald Trump. These issues tend to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-trumps-presence-in-the-midterms-is-risky-for-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remind voters of Republican power and influence</a> and potentially make the election more of a 2020-like choice between Democrats and Republicans and less of a referendum on Biden and Democrats’ performance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But now, issues like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/politics/marthas-vineyard-massachusetts-migrants-planes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/13/business/markets-plunge-on-higher-than-expected-inflation-numbers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy</a> are again <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-feel-about-republican-governors-sending-migrants-to-blue-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting more headlines</a>. That’s not to say abortion and those other issues won’t matter, but the summer could have reflected a best-case scenario for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this?</strong> Not exactly. The model accounts for uncertainty due to future news events. But it doesn’t make any assumptions about whether these surprises tend to benefit one party over another.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But … I’d be careful overthinking this. People who cover politics for a living, including me, live in a bubble full of people who pay far more attention to day-to-day political developments than regular voters do. Pundits’ guesses about which stories voters will care about, or how they will affect their voting preferences, are often wrong. Moreover, the life cycle of stories tends to be pretty short. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s decision to send immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard was a huge story until about a week ago, but now we have a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/28/nord-stream-pipeline-explosions-eu-00059262" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devastating hurricane</a> and a new wave of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/energy-inflation-crises-risk-pushing-big-economies-into-recession-oecd-2022-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic concerns</a> that have usurped it. So in practice, assuming that future news events create uncertainty <em>in both directions</em> will <em>usually</em> be the best course.</p>



<h2><strong>Republicans could overtake Democrats in advertising</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">If I were actually <a href="https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7132/Which-party-will-win-the-2022-US-Senate-election-in-Wisconsin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">betting on election outcomes at prediction markets</a> — and no, I don’t do that for a variety of reasons! — I’d pay attention to the flow of campaign advertising. Advertising may not matter <em>that</em> much in terms of moving votes in an era with relatively few swing voters. But it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/upshot/do-campaign-ads-matter-donald-trump-gives-a-rare-chance-to-find-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certainly matters some</a>, and the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250168734_Short-Term_Effects_of_Advertising_Some_Well-Established_Empirical_Law-Like_Patterns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effects can be short-lived</a>. So if one candidate had a <em>temporary</em> edge on their airwaves, it might lead to a <em>temporary </em>surge in the polls, which would then recede.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So one potential source of concern for Democrats would be if they’d dominated the advertising race during the summer, but only temporarily.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Is this happening? I honestly don’t know. There are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-spend-millions-tv-ads-midterms-why-doesnt-trump-2022-09-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some accounts</a> of Republican groups having boosted spending recently. But while public fundraising and campaign spending is <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/raising-bythenumbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively easy to track</a>, outside spending also plays a large role and is more opaque. Moreover, outside spending has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/by_group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to favor conservatives and Republicans</a> this cycle. With that said, not every dollar is spent equally well. Outside groups <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/13/political-ads-advertisement-campaign-spending-iowa-tv-citizens-united-super-pac-candidate-dark-money/1283739002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t get the same favorable advertising rates</a> that campaigns themselves do, and it’s cheaper to buy ads in advance rather than at the last minute.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this?</strong> Not really. The model doesn’t make any assumptions at all about advertising. It doesn’t discount or adjust a poll because it came during an advertising blitz, for example. Nor does it make any assumption about future advertising spend. The model <em>does</em> account for fundraising; money raised from individual donors is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the factors that the model evaluates</a> in addition to the polls. But this is more because fundraising tends to be a proxy for grassroots support rather than because of any additional advertising leverage it provides.</p>



<h2><strong>Republicans are more likely than not to have an enthusiasm advantage</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason that the <a href="https://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1226a1MidtermPolitics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aforementioned ABC News poll</a> was so worrying for Democrats is because of the relatively large enthusiasm differential it showed between registered voters — among whom Democrats trailed on the generic ballot by only 1 percentage point — and likely voters, among whom they trailed by 5. That 4-point “enthusiasm gap” was somewhat reminiscent of the 2010 midterms, when there was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly a 6-point gap between polls of registered and likely voters</a>, leading to a catastrophic election for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But other polls do not show the same enthusiasm disadvantage for Democrats. As Cohn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/upshot/republicans-midterm-elections.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentions</a>, for instance, there was only a 1-point enthusiasm gap in The New York Times’s recent generic ballot polling. Other <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/17/republicans-enthusiasm-biden-popularity-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> in the wake of the Dobbs decision found that while Republicans were more excited than usual to vote at the midterms, so were Democrats. Democrats have also tended to have strong turnout in recent special elections and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/25/upshot/female-voters-dobbs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ballot referendums</a>. The consensus of the evidence points toward a modest enthusiasm gap favoring Republicans — enough to make matters harder for Democrats, especially in the House — but nothing like the magnitude of 2010.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? </strong>Yes, the model explicitly accounts for the likely GOP enthusiasm advantage. Specifically, it adjusts polls of registered voters to make them equivalent to polls of likely voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Initially, this adjustment is based on historical patterns: Republican voters have historically been more likely to turn out than Democratic ones, and voters of the opposition party are more likely to turn out than voters from the president’s party.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the model begins to override this prior assumption by looking at polls like ABC News’s that publish among both registered and likely voters, but for now it still plays some role and helps Republicans in our forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> In 2018, those factors offset one another (Republicans had the traditional enthusiasm advantage, but Democrats were the opposition party). But this year, they’re both working in the GOP’s favor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I can also see an argument that this assumption is too generous to Republicans, though. Voters at the midterms tend to be older, whiter and more well-educated than voters in presidential years. Historically, these factors all tended to favor Republicans. Now, however — while Republicans are still older and whiter — Democrats tend to dominate among college-educated voters, who are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-022-09717-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considerably more likely to turn out to vote</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>There’s still some reason for Democrats to be concerned about the reliability of the polls</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let me put this carefully. Two weeks ago, I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> about why I don’t agree with the <em>presumption</em> that polls — despite their shortcomings in 2016 and 2020 — are biased toward Democrats:</p>



<blockquote><p>Here, I’m going to present something of a rebuttal […] to the <em>presumption </em>I often see in discussion about polling that polling bias is predictable and necessarily favors Democrats. My contention is that while the polls could have another bad year, it’s hard to know right now whether that bias will benefit Democrats or Republicans. People’s guesses about this are often wrong. In 2014, for example, there was a lot of discussion about whether the polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-the-state-polls-skewed/">would have a pro-Republican bias</a>, as they did in 2012. But they turned out to have a pro-Democratic bias instead.</p></blockquote>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a lot of qualifications here. It doesn’t mean that the polls can’t have a bad year. But the idea behind the FiveThirtyEight model is that they’ll be biased toward Democrats in some years, they’ll be biased toward Republicans in some years, and they’ll be unbiased in some years — and it’s hard to know what you’re getting ahead of time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ve read various rebuttals to this article, some of which I find a little lacking. For instance, I simply don’t think it’s correct to claim, as Andrew Prokop <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/9/23/23353634/polls-bias-democrats-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently did in Vox</a>, that polls overestimated Democratic performance in 2018.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prokop makes this claim by focusing on so-called competitive Senate races, but there are a few problems with that. The definition of competitive races is arbitrary, and in 2018, many Senate races that were assumed to be competitive were conducted in strongly red states, such as Missouri, Tennessee and West Virginia. In House and gubernatorial races, by contrast, which provide for a more comprehensive picture, polls had a slight &lt;em&gt;Republican&lt;/em&gt; bias, &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to FiveThirtyEight’s analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a> To treat anti-Republican bias in the polls as a sort of inescapable empirical regularity based on a sample of two election cycles, neither of which was the most recent midterm, is making too much of limited evidence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But does that mean I give no credence at all to what we might call the Predictable Democratic Polling Bias (PDPB) hypothesis? No, of course not. Good <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/05/everybodys-an-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fox-like</a> forecasters can hold multiple ideas or hypotheses in their head at once. PDPB has some things going for it. My mental model of the race might be something like: mostly the FiveThirtyEight forecast, but with a little smidge of weight that PDPB is real.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s the case <em>for</em> PDPB? Again, I don’t think it’s an empirical one. Empirically, the evidence strongly shows that polling bias is unpredictable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the theoretical case that analyst Richard Hanania makes for PDPB in his recent <a href="https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-polling-might-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substack post</a> is plausible. If, fundamentally, Republicans are less likely to answer surveys because (for instance) they have lower social trust, that’s not necessarily an <em>intractable</em> problem. But it could be one that hasn’t been addressed yet. It could take pollsters a couple of election cycles to work out the right approach, especially if it requires abandoning traditional polling best practices.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly enough, PDPB wouldn’t necessarily doom Democrats in the Senate. Even if polls had a 3-point pro-Democratic bias, Democrat John Fetterman would <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still be favored in Pennsylvania</a>, where he leads by 6 points in our polling average. Democratic incumbents Raphael Warnock in Georgia and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada would technically be underdogs (they currently lead by 2.1 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively). But Georgia and Nevada have had fairly accurate polling in recent years. Any amount of PDPB would doom Democrats’ chances in the House, however.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? </strong>Sort of.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although the model doesn’t assume any sort of permanent polling bias, it does give some weight to the fundamentals, and as I mentioned above, the fundamentals are more favorable to Republicans than the polls alone. The Deluxe forecast also considers expert ratings, and although how it uses these ratings is slightly complicated (read the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">methodology section</a> for more), those do help Republican odds in the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps if you give a little bit of extra mental weight to PDPB, it would be enough to account for the relatively small differences between the FiveThirtyEight forecast and <a href="https://electionbettingodds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">betting markets</a>. For instance, betting markets give Republicans a 39 percent chance of winning Senate control, as compared to 31 percent in our Deluxe forecast, and a 75 percent chance of House control, instead of 68 percent. Those are small enough differences that I’m not sure I’d make huge bets on either side.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Protests in Iran <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/amid-protests-irans-guard-strikes-kurdish-groups-iraq-90513367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been raging</a> on for nearly two weeks because <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/calls-probe-iranian-womans-death-amid-protests-90195651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22-year-old Mahsa Amini died</a> in the custody of the “morality police” after she allegedly failed to comply with the nation’s veiling laws. The protests that <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/28/what-we-know-after-11-days-of-protests-in-iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began on the streets of Saqqez</a>, her hometown, have now spread to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/world/middleeast/iran-protests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 80 cities</a> across the nation, as Iranian women lead demonstrations in defiance of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62967381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a law that mandates</a> they cover their hair and wear loose-fitting clothes while in public. At least <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63047363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76 people have died</a>, although the toll is likely higher as internet restrictions have made information harder to confirm. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Amini’s death may have sparked this recent uprising, but data shows Iranian opposition toward required veiling isn’t new. The Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran, a Netherlands-based research foundation, conducted <a href="https://gamaan.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GAMAAN-Iran-Religion-Survey-2020-English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a comprehensive study</a> in 2020 on Iranians’ opinions about religion and found that a whopping 72 percent of literate Iranians over age 19<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, “The target population consisted of literate Iranian residents above 19 years old (who were capable of using the Internet and reading the survey questions). … This accounts for 85% of the adult population of Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> disagreed with the government mandating that women wear the hijab in public, compared with only 15 percent who agreed with it. Over the years, those who have subverted the law have faced <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/23/amini-hijab-morality-police-iran/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violent beatings</a> and, in the case of Amini, fatal consequences at the hands of the government. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These events have brought a simmering question to a boil: In a world <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-08-11/religion-giving-god" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly secular</a> and interconnected, what role do people think theology should play in determining law? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Iran is now associated with mandatory veiling, that was not always the case. In 1936, the penultimate shah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/iran-and-the-headscarf-protests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decreed a ban</a> on hijab in an attempt to promote European attire. Women who failed to comply with this prior law similarly faced punishments, such as imprisonment. The newer mandate, which Iranians are protesting now, was implemented when the pro-Western, secular monarchy was replaced with an Islamic theocracy after the 1979 revolution. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, the veil was banned, and now it’s mandatory. But once again, most Iranians are proponents of change — not just for hijab law but also for the role of religion in government more broadly. Only 22 percent of literate Iranians over age 19<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, “The target population consisted of literate Iranian residents above 19 years old (who were capable of using the Internet and reading the survey questions). … This accounts for 85% of the adult population of Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> believe an Islamic republic is the most suitable governing structure for their country, according to a <a href="https://gamaan.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GAMAAN-Political-Systems-Survey-2022-English-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> by GAMAAN conducted in February. Meanwhile, in a separate question, 88 percent agreed that having a democratic system would be a good idea. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also in that study, two-thirds said they did not want a government run according to religious law, which challenges the inherent premise of the country’s current governing structure. In contrast, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/13/half-of-americans-say-bible-should-influence-u-s-laws-including-28-who-favor-it-over-the-will-of-the-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half of all Americans thought</a> the Bible should have at least some bearing on the law, despite this nation’s <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/separation_of_church_and_state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">principles separating church and state</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the decades since its 1979 revolution, Iran has faced its fair share of political uprisings — due to claims of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/world/middleeast/14iran.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rigged elections</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/protests-grip-major-iran-cities-gas-prices-killed-67076102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soaring gas prices</a>, for example. But this current political moment has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/world/middleeast/iran-protests-raisi-khamenei-hijab.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uniquely united</a> Iranian women across socioeconomic, ethnic and regional lines. Furthermore, the recent demonstrations are not simply a protest of the current ruling politicians but also one that challenges how religion underpins the law overall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Outside of Iran, however, the global trend has been toward repression of religion in the public sphere. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/30/key-findings-about-restrictions-on-religion-around-the-world-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew has tracked</a> government limitations on religion since 2007. According to data published in 2021, Pew found that the global level of politically affiliated religious restriction was higher than it had been for most of the prior decade. Meanwhile, the history of Iran shows that both forced and forbidden faith can lead to dangerous consequences for citizens. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-internet-censorship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing internet shutdowns</a> will likely keep international eyes from seeing everything happening in Iran, including the government’s violence toward those speaking up. But quashing protests will not necessarily mean quashing dissent. Although Ali Khamenei, Iran’s current supreme leader, has long posited <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa/supreme-leader-khamenei-says-u-s-is-irans-number-one-enemy-idUSKBN1D211H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside influences, especially the U.S.</a>, as the greatest threat to his rule, this moment suggests that Iran’s own citizens — and its women in particular — could present a huge challenge to the power of theocracy.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The share of Democrats who believe President Biden should run for office again has ticked up slightly over the past two months, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/09/28/democrats-believe-biden-should-run-2024-primary-harris/">per recent polling from Morning Consult/Politico</a>. Fifty-nine percent of Democratic voters said they’d support his reelection campaign in a Sept. 23-25 survey, up from 51 percent in early July and 53 percent in early August. In the case that he does not run, however, a plurality of Democratic voters (28 percent) said they would support Vice President Kamala Harris instead, followed by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (13 percent). </li></ul><ul><li>In light of Hurricane Ian, the Jan. 6 House Select Committee postponed its ninth hearing, which was scheduled for Sept. 28 and would have been the first since July. Though a new date has yet to be announced, 58 percent of Americans support resuming the hearings following those in the summer, according to <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_092722/">a poll from Monmouth University</a> conducted Sept. 21-25. Unsurprisingly, that number reveals a highly partisan divide: 83 percent of Democrats reported wanting the hearings to continue, but only 31 percent of Republicans agreed. And while 62 percent of Democrats said the hearings should carry on as long as necessary, 75 percent of Republicans said the investigation should conclude as soon as possible. </li></ul><ul><li>On the heels of President Vladimir Putin granting Russian citizenship to former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, a Sept. 28 <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/09/28/c07fb/2">YouGov survey</a> asked Americans about his notorious 2013 leak of top-secret information on government surveillance. Thirty-nine percent said Snowden’s actions constituted “the right thing to do.” <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/09/28/c07fb/1">Additional polling</a> found that almost 6 in 10 Americans think it is “somewhat” (29 percent) or “very” (29 percent) common that the U.S. government surveils ordinary citizens who aren’t suspected of committing a crime. Nonetheless, a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/09/28/c07fb/3">third question</a> showed that only around a quarter of Americans (27 percent) take any precautions to avoid surveillance of their personal devices, although that number varies by age: While only 19 percent of adults 65 or over say they take such precautions, that share increases to 35 percent among those under 30. </li></ul><ul><li>Overall, just 26 percent of Americans are at least somewhat interested in learning more about the metaverse, but according to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/09/27/frequent-moviegoers-are-more-open-to-metaverse/">polling from Morning Consult</a> conducted Aug. 24-25, that share rises to 63 percent among moviegoers who frequent theaters at least three times a month. That’s even more than gamers (55 percent), sports betters (50 percent) or those with five or more streaming subscriptions (40 percent). Those moviegoers were also much more likely than Americans in general to report having read, heard or seen mentions of the metaverse.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This 2016 story followed a team of Waffle House operations analysts as they decided whether to close any of the chain’s locations in preparation for Hurricane Matthew, a Category 5 storm that ended up affecting the Florida coast as a Category 2 storm. This week, as at least 21 Waffle House locations in Florida closed due to </em><a href="https://www.al.com/life/2022/09/hurricane-ian-so-severe-that-florida-waffle-houses-are-closing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hurricane Ian</em></a><em>,</em><em> we thought we should revisit what happens when the famously resilient restaurant shuts its doors for a storm — and why even the federal government pays attention when it does. </em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a warm, cloudy morning in the first week of October, in an anonymous office park just outside Atlanta, operations analyst Matt Stark opened a computer program, ran through some data and looked thoughtfully at the results.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Out in the Atlantic Ocean, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Matthew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hurricane Matthew</a> was hurling winds of 115 miles an hour toward the coast of Florida. Hundreds of miles inland, in the headquarters of Waffle House Inc., Stark’s software predicted that 477 of the chain’s almost 1,900 restaurants might be affected by the onrushing storm.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This meant two things. First, as the storm made landfall, some locations of Waffle House — which boasts that every restaurant stays open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year — would probably have to close because of power loss or concerns for workers’ safety. And second, sometime after they did, someone would invoke the “Waffle House Index,” the slightly flippant measure of how bad a storm can get.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Matthew brought on both those expected scenarios. Waffle House announced Oct. 6 that it was pre-emptively closing some restaurants on a 90-mile stretch of Interstate 95 between Fort Pierce and Titusville in Florida. (In the next few days, as the storm churned up the coast and flooded North Carolina, it would close 98 all told.) And as soon as the announcement went out, media tracking the storm, and customers on social media, invoked the closings as a sign of the apocalypse.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article106546297.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami Herald</a>: “When Waffle House surrenders to a hurricane, you know it’s bad.” The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/10/07/hurricane-matthew-is-so-scary-even-waffle-house-is-evacuating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a>: “Hurricane Matthew is so scary even the always-open eatery is evacuating.” A faithful <a href="https://twitter.com/e20b255b/status/784131483627696128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer on Twitter</a>: “GOD IN HEAVEN THIS IS THE END!”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In those areas, the Waffle House Index had just gone to red.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Disaster responders pay attention to that index, which was created — in the midst of 2004’s devastating Hurricane Charley — by W. Craig Fugate, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency since 2009. Fugate was director of emergency management for Florida when Charley slammed the state with unexpected force: Its winds strengthened abruptly and it went from a Category 2 to a Category 4, and the storm suddenly changed direction and struck the state’s Gulf Coast at Sanibel, 150 miles south of its predicted landfall. Tens of thousands of people were reportedly left homeless.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fugate was in his office with state meteorologist Ben Nelson and members of the Florida National Guard, color-coding infrastructure loss on a map — green for operating, yellow for affected, and red for destroyed — and the group decided to take a look at some of the damage, and try to find a meal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They went to a Waffle House and noticed they had a limited menu, with nonperishable items,” Alexa Lopez, FEMA’s press secretary, told me. “The next day, they were driving around and they went to a different Waffle House, and the same thing happened, a limited menu.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, she said, the group was inspired first to rank Waffle Houses in the same way: green for fully operational, yellow for a limited menu and red for closed. “Which is pretty bad, because Waffle House is always open,” Lopez added. And, second, to use those observations as a proxy for how much a disaster disrupts a community. Fugate has since been quoted as saying: “If you get there and the Waffle House is closed? That’s really bad. That’s where you go to work.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The concept of restaurant operations as an indicator of storm impact percolated slowly into emergency-management culture — the magazine Environment Health Safety Today wrote about it <a href="http://ehstoday.com/fire_emergencyresponse/disaster-planning/waffles-risk-management-0706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in July 2011</a> — and broke out into the open around the time of Hurricane Irene in August 2011 (when, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904716604576542460736605364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to The Wall Street Journal</a>, 22 Waffle Houses lost power but only one stayed closed longer than a day)<strong>.</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the so-called index isn’t actually an official metric. FEMA doesn’t publish it anywhere; no one, except for Waffle House itself, counts how many restaurants are running lean or forced to close. But the company does give that count to the agency, and FEMA uses it — along with wind speeds and power outages and other objective measures — to judge a storm’s impact, and to figure out where its own crews and other emergency responders can get fed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, so obvious: If a storm is bad enough to close restaurants that “never close,” we can agree that storm is bad. Hurricane Matthew was the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/first-above-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season-since-2012-produced-five-landfalling-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest storm</a> of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, which ended Nov. 30.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the Waffle House Index also stands for something less obvious. It is an indicator of how complex and long supply chains are — for food, for fuel, for power — and of what it takes to plan around infrastructure that can be fragile in unexpected ways.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The essence of the index is not just that the situation is bad,” Panos Kouvelis, director of the Boeing Center for Supply Chain Innovation at Washington University in St. Louis, told me. “Companies like Waffle House, and Wal-Mart and Home Depot, operate in areas that are frequently hit by disasters, where their operations may go down at the same time the demand for their services go up. So they have had to develop very well-defined playbooks for being prepared.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But preparation is a complicated endeavor in an economy where few things are sold in the places where they were made. Vanilla comes from Madagascar. The United States imports most of its salt. The plywood needed to protect windows from storm debris might have been manufactured in China, and a storm in the Gulf of Mexico can force enough interruption on petroleum refining to choke off supply on the other side of the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“When I talk to companies about whether they understand their supply chains, they generally know one step up and back: who they buy from and who they sell to,” said Amy Kircher, director of the Food Protection and Defense Institute at the University of Minnesota. “They don’t understand that there are five or 10 steps in the chain before the product reaches them. Or that the alternate suppliers they consider their contingency plan are all buying from the same place.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At Waffle House headquarters in November, Stark and his colleagues on the chain’s storm team — Vice Presidents Pat Warner and Will Mizell and Communications Director Kelly Thrasher-Bruner, who handles social media in disasters — walked me through how they prepare. As we talked, Stark pulled up an updated post-Matthew map. Of 200 restaurants that ended up in the storm’s path, just one, in inland North Carolina, gleamed red, for “still affected”; it had been flooded and needed cleaning out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s a big deal for us to shut down, because we’re not used to turning everything off and turning the lights off and closing the door,” said Warner, who estimates that he has worked “more than 10” hurricane responses in 17 years. “So our goal is to open up as quickly as possible afterward. The operations team works with the distributor to get food ready to go in. The construction team lines up generators. If you have generators you have to have fuel, so we line up that.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the edge of the predicted storm zone — which Stark monitors from a temporary “war room” assembled by putting mobile giant screens in a conference room — the company positions personnel who can swoop in: carpenters, electricians, IT specialists, a food-safety expert and someone to talk to local governments and law enforcement and soothe concerns about curfews. A little farther out, restaurants in other markets line up “jump teams”: spare personnel who volunteer to work in place of locals who might have evacuated or might need to repair their homes or care for family. In Hurricane Matthew, the company sent in an extra 250 people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We say we throw chaos at chaos,” Mizell said. “We just throw a lot of resources down there to get restaurants open. Our CEO will be there. In Matthew, our chairman was there, too.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before the carpenters and computer specialists or the replacement cooks and servers arrive, the company assesses how long it has been since supplies were delivered and — just as crucial — how long since the local trash removal company last emptied the dumpster. “Most restaurants get a delivery once a week,” Stark said. “If it got there Wednesday and the storm hits Thursday, they should have enough food, but if the storm hits Tuesday, we may have to hurry up and get some food there.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Waffle House uses one main distributor, Illinois-based US Foods, which has depots scattered across the Southeast, where most Waffle Houses are concentrated, and where many hurricanes that strike the U.S. make landfall. So supplies don’t need to travel far in advance of a storm and are close by once roads are clear.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That model of staging supplies and personnel in layers outside an emergency, in order to swoop in quickly once it abates, isn’t unique to Waffle House. It’s also followed by the military and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which oversees the Strategic National Stockpile of emergency medications, vaccines and antidotes for natural disasters and biological attacks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We think about, What are the timelines in which people have to be provided medications?” Greg Burel, the stockpile’s director, told me. “Our primary stock is laid down in undisclosed locations around the country that give us access to large swaths of the population and that are accessible” by more than one type of transportation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the CDC also puts smaller, lighter assets — the equivalent of a temporary field hospital or a stash of medications that could be deployed immediately — “as far forward as we can if we have advance notice, but not so far forward that it becomes victim to that event,” Burel said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The first rule of operating in a disaster, though, is keeping personnel safe. Every Waffle House employee gets a key fob with lists of relevant phone numbers. Local managers keep track of who has challenging home situations — disabled parents, children with special needs, single heads of household — and might need extra help. Every location has a wall-mounted “crisis response” flier that includes detachable wallet cards listing personal-preparedness steps for hurricanes, tornadoes and ice storms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The cards also remind employees how needed they will be at work. “We will be very busy,” the current hurricane-preparedness card says, “and you will make lots of money!”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="862" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/waffle_inline.jpg.webp" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/waffle_inline.jpg.webp" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/waffle_inline.jpg.webp?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/waffle_inline.jpg.webp?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Once employees arrive or return and a location can open, they work through the storm manual: a giant binder, a kind of choose-your-own-adventure game composed in eggs and grits. “Here’s how you run the restaurant if you’re without power, without gas for the grills, without water,” Mizell said. “We can cook on the grills even if we don’t have electricity. We can bring in bottled water and canned Coke products and serve on to-go plates. We can get porta-potties.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The storm team examines what worked and didn’t after every disaster, each time learning new lessons. In Hurricane Katrina — when they closed 107 locations in Mississippi and on the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain — roads were so bad they stashed supplies in a refrigerated semi-trailer with armed guards, and fuel so scarce they brought in their own tank trucks. When Katrina struck in 2005, Twitter had not yet launched; now Bruner uses it not just to alert customers to closings, but to crowdsource whether roads are open and where the power is on.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Waffle House began working on storm response before Katrina — Warner said he thinks the first organized attempt was <a href="http://www.weather.gov/ilm/HurricaneHugo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hurricane Hugo</a>, which hit Charleston, South Carolina, in September 1989 — but from then to now, the company’s biggest need in disasters hasn’t changed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“People,” Warner said. “We can get the food there, by hook or by crook. It costs more, but we’re willing to spend it. But if we don’t have people, we can’t open up.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Once again, everyone <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-20/hollywood-s-paltrow-joins-soros-backing-beto-o-rourke-in-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t</a> <a href="https://abc.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/video/vdka29896870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop</a> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/23/beto-o-rourke-texas-democrats-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking about</a> <a href="https://www.cc.com/episodes/fgmych/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-september-21-2022-beto-o-rourke-season-27-ep-135" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beto O’Rourke</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a><a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> shows a single-digit contest in the Texas gubernatorial race between O’Rourke and the Republican incumbent, Greg Abbott. Earlier this year, O’Rourke made headlines for his <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/07/15/texas-governor-2022-abbott-orourke-fundraising-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking fundraising</a>, and the fallout from a succession of high-profile events in the state — the <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/texas/2022/08/25/431599/texas-republicans-long-sought-trigger-law-on-abortion-now-in-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triggering of a preexisting state law</a> banning abortions, continued <a href="https://www.sacurrent.com/news/texas-experienced-more-power-outages-than-any-other-state-over-the-past-20-years-report-says-29896472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strains on the power grid</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/us/uvalde-back-to-school.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass shooting</a> at an elementary school in Uvalde, one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history — are giving him unexpected leverage against Abbott. As a result, this gubernatorial election could be one of Texas’s most competitive since Democrats last held the office in the 1990s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s be real about one thing, though: The overall electoral environment might be improving for Democrats, but O’Rourke is still a serious long shot. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm-election forecast</a><a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> gives Abbott a 95-in-100 chance of besting his ubiquitous Democratic challenger. But is it possible that after his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closer-than-expected</a> Senate race against Ted Cruz in 2018 and rise to national prominence after a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-beto-orourkes-pivot-didnt-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly eight-month campaign</a> in the 2020 presidential election, a narrow loss against Abbott in November could be a victory for Texas Democrats in the long run?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea that O’Rourke could be laying the groundwork for future Democratic victories in Texas isn’t a crazy one. After all, other <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-georgia-turned-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Southern states like Georgia</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-hope-georgia-will-become-the-next-virginia-but-it-could-end-up-being-the-next-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia and North Carolina</a> have become somewhat more competitive over the past <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several election cycles</a>. But another close statewide race for O’Rourke this year doesn’t necessarily mean Texas is on the verge of turning blue — or even purple. That’s because O’Rourke is, well, O’Rourke, and without a stronger campaign infrastructure throughout the state, it will be hard for most Texas Democrats running in statewide elections to replicate his level of fundraising and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/02/11/beto-orourke-supporters-texas-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fanfare</a>. And, fundamentally, Texas is still a red-leaning state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">O’Rourke’s campaign style is hard to emulate because, for one, he’s become a buzzy celebrity candidate since his 2018 race, and he has a gift for making headlines. When he’s not <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/08/11/beto-orourke-uvalde-gun-heckler/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standing up to hecklers</a> at campaign events or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/25/beto-orourke-greg-abbott-uvalde-shooting-interrupt/?itid=lk_inline_manual_22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interrupting Abbott at a news conference</a> in Uvalde, where 19 students and two teachers died <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/us/uvalde-back-to-school.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a mass shooting</a>, O’Rourke has made a name for himself by <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/what-makes-beto-run-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zig-zagging his Toyota Tundra</a> across the state, snapping selfies with voters and <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article264407536.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping f-bombs</a> to fire up his base. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the chart below shows, public curiosity about O’Rourke has waned since his 2020 run, according to Google Trends data, but he’s still able to draw national attention. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Search interest for Beto O'Rourke peaked in 2019" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3tY0d/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">But politicians can only get so far on personality alone — and O’Rourke is no exception. That doesn’t mean he isn’t a strong candidate, though. A poll fielded in late August and early September by the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/blog/new-uttexas-politics-project-poll-abbott-maintains-45-40-lead-over-o%E2%80%99rourke-52-support-busing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin</a> gave Abbott only a 5-percentage-point edge over O’Rourke. And another, more recent, poll from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a> conducted in late September gave Abbott a slightly larger, 7-point edge. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, it’s unlikely that O’Rourke will be able to build a lasting campaign infrastructure for future Texas Democrats to replicate if they want to run statewide. That’s because of one major problem: an apparent lack of organization among the Democratic Party in Texas. To build on O’Rourke’s 2018 — and likely 2022 — margins against incumbent Republicans, the party would need to build and sustain a solid campaign infrastructure well past this year’s midterm elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“One of the issues for Democrats here is that there’s been a lot of turnover in their candidate pool,” said James Henson, the executive director of the Texas Politics Project. “To me, that’s a pretty big indicator that there’s not really an established, institutional foundation in the Democratic Party here in the way that you <em>do</em> see it on the Republican side.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition to issues with <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-democrats-recruitment-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruitment and turnover</a> facing Democrats running in marquee Texas races — save for O’Rourke and former oil executive Mike Collier, who is <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/politics/texas-lieutenant-governor-race-2022/285-08a76600-ec40-44f2-a83b-77233a2fa39e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick</a> again after losing to him by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-texas-elections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 points in 2018</a> — the party has <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/01/analysis-lupe-valdez-long-time-cop-why-didnt-she-lead-school-safety-co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run inexperienced candidates</a> against formidable Republicans and doesn’t have a presence in a sizable chunk of the state. Case in point: Over 50 of Texas’s 254 counties have <a href="https://www.texasdemocrats.org/county-parties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no organized county party or leaders</a>, according to the state Democratic Party’s website. A notable number of those counties are in rural parts of the state too, and even in 2018, O’Rourke won the support of only <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/02/beto-orourke-rural-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 percent of the voters</a> living in Texas’s 186 rural<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined here as having a &lt;a href="https://tlc.texas.gov/docs/policy/Def_Rural_Statutes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;population of less than 50,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a> counties, according to The Texas Tribune. Cruz, in contrast, won over 75 percent of the vote there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, Henson told me, there’s no obvious successor who can build off — and improve upon — the infrastructure that O’Rourke’s campaign has created. “In the past, there were times when successful campaigns, at least indirectly, provided people with a model for organizing and professional skills,” Henson said. “But that’s just not happening here in Texas.” In 2018, O’Rourke’s close contest against Cruz helped Democrats Lizzie Fletcher of Houston and Colin Allred of Dallas flip two congressional districts by each unseating a long-term Republican incumbent. Democrats had a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/06/texas-midterm-election-results-texas-house-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net gain of 12 seats in the Texas House</a> as well. But then, in 2020, Texas Democrats <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/22/texas-democrats-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell short</a> of their electoral goals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are other reasons, though, why a close win for O’Rourke doesn’t necessarily speak to Democrats’ political future in Texas. For one, the Republican Party’s brand is still strong in Texas. When it comes to key policy issues, polling suggests that voters still overwhelmingly trust Republicans over Democrats. The August-September Texas Politics Project survey, for example, showed that voters were more likely to trust Abbott over O’Rourke on handling issues like the U.S.-Mexico border situation and the economy. Voters trusted O’Rourke more on abortion, however. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet while voters were divided over who could better handle gun violence, Texans said the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/most-important-issue-facing-texas-august-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top issues</a> facing the state were border security, immigration, political corruption/leadership and inflation/rising prices — abortion and gun control/gun violence were further down their list. That means that any Democrat running after O’Rourke would need to win voters’ trust on these issues — and that’s a tall order given that even O’Rourke has had only limited success.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="On issues most important to Texans, voters trust Abbott more" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/J3OFw/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="559" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/15/texas-demographics-census-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demographic changes in Texas</a> that at one point may have been viewed as good news for Democrats might not end up working in their favor. The state’s Hispanic population is growing, but demographics are not destiny in American politics — and those voters might be <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/democrats-losing-texas-latinos-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hard bloc</a> for Democrats to make further gains with, especially after Texas’s border counties <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved sharply to the right</a> in 2020. Voters in other rural parts of the state have also been hard for Democrats to win, and despite O’Rourke’s campaigning in rural counties, it’s not clear whether even he is <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/02/beto-orourke-rural-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making significant inroads</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And so far, O’Rourke hasn’t necessarily provided a foolproof model for winning over <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/2022-gubernatorial-vote-intention-august-2022#party-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican and independent voters</a>, whose support he’d need to beat Abbott in what is still a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red-leaning state</a>. O’Rourke might be a major presence in Texas, but he’s not actually that popular. A September poll from the <a href="https://www.uttyler.edu/politicalscience/files/dmn-uttyler-sept2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Tyler for The Dallas Morning News</a>, for instance, found that almost half of the state’s registered voters — 47 percent — had a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion of O’Rourke compared with 40 percent who viewed him in a positive light. He didn’t fare well with independent voters, either: 46 percent had an unfavorable view of O’Rourke versus 34 percent who had a favorable opinion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The survey didn’t ask respondents to assess Abbott’s favorability, but exactly half of voters said they strongly or somewhat approved of his job performance as governor; meanwhile, 47 percent said they disapproved. Those numbers have given O’Rourke’s opponents an opportunity, too. Since his presidential campaign, he has given Republicans a useful foil to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/15/texas-beto-orourke-guns-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspire their own turnout</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, for Texas Democrats to succeed statewide, they’d need to have a healthy mixture of O’Rourke’s popularity, an appeal to a wider swath of voters and, ideally, not be a bogeyman or bogey(wo)man for Republicans. That’s a big ask in a state that hasn’t fielded especially strong Democratic candidates beyond O’Rourke in the past few statewide election cycles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, because the Democratic candidate is O’Rourke — a micro-celebrity in the state and nationwide — the race could be close. That said, his race likely won’t say much about Texas Democrats’ larger ambitions to flip the state because there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done before they get there.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are election deniers, and then there’s Kari Lake. While <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">201 Republican nominees</a><a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 28 at 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> have fully denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, few have made claims of fraud as central to their campaign as Lake, the Republican nominee for Arizona governor. A <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/07/trump-gop-kari-lake-00050215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">darling among former President Donald Trump’s endorsees</a>, Lake has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-denying-primary-candidates-are-crying-fraud-win-or-lose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeated his unfounded claims</a> that the 2020 election was “stolen” and spread <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/08/1116394618/arizona-pinal-county-election-woes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baseless conspiracy theories</a> about election fraud. And she looks well-positioned to take on her Democratic opponent, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, as it’s currently a toss-up with Hobbs at a 52-in-100 chance to Lake’s 48-in-100, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to our midterm forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 28 at 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So why then, in another statewide race in this purple state, is a fellow Trump-endorsed election denier facing tougher odds? Blake Masters, the Republican nominee for Senate, has just a 17-in-100 chance of winning against incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s Senate forecast</a>. Like Lake, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9fQaWdTIZQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masters has claimed</a> Trump “won in 2020,” and said he <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/2022-live-primary-election-race-results/2022/08/03/1115185686/blake-masters-trump-pick-funded-by-billionaire-thiel-wins-arizona-senate-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn’t have accepted the results</a> if he were in office at the time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, these races are about more than election denialism. While 2020 has cast a long shadow over many campaigns, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/27/arizona-voters-concerns-inflation-abortion-threats-democracy/8124857001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most voters in the state are more concerned</a> with issues like inflation and abortion than election fraud. And even when it comes to election denial, there is some daylight between Lake and Masters’s positions. Still, these candidates have a lot of similarities, at least on paper, so why is one in a toss-up and the other struggling to keep up? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s stress test a few theories of where these two candidates are similar — and where they differ — to see if we can unravel the mystery of Blake and Lake. </p>



<h2><strong>Different races, different opponents</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One possible explanation is simply that Lake and Masters are squaring off against different opponents. Kelly has a couple of advantages that Hobbs doesn’t. For one, Kelly is an incumbent, and a popular one — in a September survey of likely Arizona voters <a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/politics/2022/aarp-arizona-2022-elections-voter-survey-governor.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00550.011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by AARP/Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research</a>, the senator had a 50 percent approval rating, including a 14 percent approval rating among Republicans (as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/09/rising-partisan-antipathy-widening-party-gap-in-presidential-job-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far as cross-party approval</a> goes, that’s pretty good). As a former astronaut and the husband of <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/14267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Rep. Gabby Giffords,</a> he has a lot of name recognition and a healthy amount of public goodwill. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Hobbs has been unavoidably at the center of the election denial issue. As secretary of state, Hobbs was responsible for administering the 2020 election and certifying the results, making her <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/10/11/the-unstoppable-kari-lake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persona non grata</a> for voters who baselessly believe that the election was fraudulent. Hobbs was also <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/12/08/katie-hobbs-apologizes-recognizes-discrimination-talonya-adams-firing/6426337001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embroiled in an actual scandal</a> last year over the prior firing of a staffer while she was in the state Senate. And Hobbs has <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/09/12/katie-hobbs-is-a-chicken-for-ducking-a-debate-kari-lakes-campaign-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to debate Lake</a>, a move that has given her opponent <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/09/12/katie-hobbs-is-a-chicken-for-ducking-a-debate-kari-lakes-campaign-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of fuel</a> for attacks while preventing voters from seeing the two candidates square off head-to-head (though they will both <a href="https://ktar.com/story/5264155/katie-hobbs-kari-lake-set-to-participate-in-town-hall-event-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be participating</a> in a town hall forum next week). Combined, these factors show Hobbs as a weaker opponent than Kelly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But FiveThirtyEight’s polling averages suggest that’s not the sole explanation for the differences in these two races. The polls show <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masters struggling to keep up</a> with Kelly, while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake is giving</a> Hobbs a run for her money. But if you look at total vote shares, it’s clear that the biggest difference is not between Kelly and Hobbs — it’s between Lake and Masters. Kelly, Hobbs and Lake are all within spitting distance of each other: Kelly has 49 percent support, Hobbs 47 percent, and Lake is right on Hobbs’s tail with 46 percent. But Masters is the odd one out with only 42 percent support, showing that in these races, the biggest gulf is between the GOP candidates, not their opponents. </p>



<h2><strong>Mo’ money, no problems?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">If their respective opponents aren’t to blame for the discrepancy between Lake and Masters, maybe their bank accounts are. While never a guarantee of a win, a well-funded campaign can sometimes explain the difference in a close race. In the governor’s race, the most recent <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/Reporting/Explore#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2023%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state election filings</a> show Lake has brought in $3.8 million and spent $3.6 million, while Hobbs has outraised her only marginally, <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/Reporting/Explore#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2023%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing in $4.4 million</a> and spending $3.9 million. In the Senate race, Masters <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AZ00372/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised just over $5 million</a>. But Kelly. Oh, Kelly. He has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/fundraising-totals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the highest-funded election campaigns</a> in the country, having raised over $54 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0AZ00350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as of July</a>, spending over $30 million, so it’s almost certainly even higher as we head into the midterms. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it certainly <em>seems</em> like we found our outlier, but as I mentioned above, the starkest differences in the polls are between support for the GOP nominees, not the Democrats. Kelly’s flush coffers have likely helped him tamp down his opponent more effectively than Hobbs, but it also doesn’t explain the whole story. </p>



<h2><strong>Beyond 2020</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s return to the assumptions at the top that Lake and Masters are, at least on paper, very similar candidates. While it’s true that they both have repeated lies about the 2020 election and have been endorsed by Trump, they differ in a couple of crucial ways. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First is that Masters <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/politics/blake-masters-campaign-website-changes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has backtracked from the 2020 election issue</a>, scrubbing language from his website claiming that Trump would have won “if we had had a free and fair election.” At first glance, this dovier posture would seem to play to Masters’s benefit. After all, Biden did win Arizona in 2020 — albeit by less than 1 percentage point — and moderate candidates <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jrodden/oslo/canes_wrone_et_al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to perform better</a> than more extreme ones. While we don’t know that Masters has suffered uniquely by taking this stance, we do know that GOP voters in Arizona aren’t exactly disqualifying candidates who take an <em>extreme </em>stance. For example, in the race for Arizona’s secretary of state, Republican candidate Mark Finchem has remained an extreme election denier (including <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/09/23/mark-finchems-fealty-to-the-big-lie-was-center-stage-in-debate-with-adrian-fontes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending most of a recent debate</a> regurgitating baseless conspiracy theories) and yet <a href="https://ktar.com/story/5256448/republican-mark-finchem-leads-adrian-fontes-in-arizona-secretary-of-state-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led in a recent poll</a> (though, notably, a full quarter of voters in that poll were undecided). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Lake has actually been the <em>less</em> extreme candidate between the two when it comes to an issue more important to voters: abortion. Masters spent the primary advocating for a national “personhood law,” which typically means a full ban on abortions nationwide, and <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2022/09/21/politifact-senate-candidate-blake-masters-backs-15-week-arizona-abortion-law-with-no-rape-incest-exceptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has supported</a> a federal 15-week abortion ban bill introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham. Since winning the primary, Masters has removed the “personhood” language from his website and <a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/elections/decision/amidst-changing-website-attack-ads-blake-masters-reiterates-his-stance-on-abortion/75-b84518d9-505f-4d50-9a1b-0fafcf2928ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said he supports</a> a federal ban on third trimester abortions. Lake says she is pro-life, but her <a href="https://www.karilake.com/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion platform</a> focuses on support for people who are pregnant and access to birth control, not addressing abortion bans. When asked directly about bans, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1554913738289037312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1554913738289037312%7Ctwgr%5E1a76fbc2dacded870689446f9b661bfb33c8e9f0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azcentral.com%2Fstory%2Fopinion%2Fop-ed%2Fej-montini%2F2022%2F08%2F04%2Fabortion-katie-hobbs-stance-solid-and-kari-lake-squishy%2F10236018002%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake has dodged the question</a>. Toss in the fact that, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/us/politics/kari-lake-arizona-republican.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after two decades</a> on local TV as a newscaster, Lake enjoys a generous dollop of name recognition, and the puzzle pieces start to come together. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We can also see something like this reflected in that AARP poll: Among Republicans, Lake is extremely popular, attracting 88 percent of likely GOP voters (Hobbs similarly has 94 percent support from Democrats), but Masters lags behind, drawing just 80 percent of likely Republican voters. Republican likely voters view Lake more favorably, too, at 80 percent favorability compared to Masters’s 71 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whichever way you slice it, Masters is coming up short where Lake is prevailing, and it’s clear her more extreme election stances haven’t stopped her from strongly contending against her Democratic opponent. While candidates like Masters are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/us/politics/election-deniers-trump-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easing away from</a> the Trumpiest rhetoric after securing their nomination, Lake may yet prove that you can still win while embracing an extreme position. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Sept. 30, 2022, 2:36 p.m.): </strong>This story has been updated to clarify that Katie Hobbs has a 52-in-100 chance of winning the Arizona governor’s race and Kari Lake has a 48-in-100 chance, not that they are projected to win 52 percent and 48 percent of the vote, respectively.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The last few weeks have been tumultuous for the issues of climate change and immigration. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/09/15/hottest-summer-august-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Record-setting summer temperatures</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/15/americas-extreme-summer-weather-of-2022-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic floods</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/how-climate-rapid-intensification-revved-up-ian-quicktake-l8klznxs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devastating hurricanes</a> have raised the stakes for the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/24/inflation-reduction-act-could-cut-climate-damages-by-1point9-trillion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate-change provisions</a> contained within the Inflation Reduction Act. Meanwhile, Republican governors in Florida and Texas <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-immigration-ron-desantis-charlie-baker-4fe96d293de4b189299a372b85c95add" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have attracted media attention</a> for paying to transport migrants and asylum seekers to liberal areas of the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These two issues aren’t obviously linked, but they have one major commonality: They rank among the most partisan in the United States. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/11/25/u-s-public-views-on-climate-and-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Those on the left care a great deal</a> about climate change, while <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/09/08/republicans-and-democrats-have-different-top-priorities-for-u-s-immigration-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those on the right are more likely to identify</a> immigration and border security as an important issue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In light of recent developments in both these areas, we decided to focus the fifth wave of our <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a> on climate change and immigration. Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we’ve been asking the same group of about 2,000 Americans what they feel are the country’s most important issues. In our latest poll, “inflation or increasing costs,” “crime or gun violence” and “political extremism or polarization” continued to appear on Americans’ list of most important issues, as they’ve ranked among the top three in each wave of our survey since we began polling in late April. But climate change (20 percent) and immigration (19 percent) were next in our most recent wave, as the chart below shows.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted Sept. 6-19, 2022, among 1,564 respondents. As was the case in the previous waves of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple-choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. The sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> </p>

Overall, 36 percent of Democrats and just 5 percent of Republicans ranked climate change as a top issue facing the country. Conversely, 38 percent of Republicans and 6 percent of Democrats cited immigration as a top concern. This split has appeared consistently across all five waves: In each, 21 percent to 36 percent of Democrats have named climate change as a top issue, and 32 percent to 38 percent of Republicans have said the same of immigration. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When it comes to climate change, Americans are divided by party on more than simply its importance. When asked how much of climate change is caused by humans, 88 percent of Democrats and just 35 percent of Republicans said that it was “entirely” or “mostly” caused by humans, with independents between the two at 65 percent.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independents included respondents who identified as “independent” or “something else,” or who skipped the question for party identity. Respondents were also given the options of “barely” or “not at all” caused by humans, “don’t know” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> When asked whether the U.S. should pass regulations related to climate change that were “more strict,” “less strict” or “about as strict as they are today,” 76 percent of Democrats, 43 percent of independents and only 17 percent of Republicans wanted stricter regulations.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were also given the option of “don’t know” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And when asked to choose between two approaches to dealing with climate change, 89 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of independents supported prioritizing changes today that would reduce the effects of climate change before they happen, while 57 percent of Republicans preferred adjusting to climate change as it’s happening to minimize disruptions to daily life. Willie Yelverton, a 50-year-old Black man from Pennsylvania who identified as a Democrat, told us that even seemingly mundane changes would be important to reducing the impact of climate change. “[The government will] need to institute standard issue tax breaks for reusable materials,” he said. “There’ll have to be bans on goods that don’t have a path to be recycled and or reused going forward. Those are small line items, but it’s a very tough pill to swallow.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, we did find more agreement across party lines when it came to legislative action to address climate change. We asked Americans whether they supported three climate-change measures <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/what-the-inflation-reduction-act-does-for-green-energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included in the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which became law last month (we asked this without referring to the Inflation Reduction Act by name). As the chart below indicates, Americans across the political spectrum were at least somewhat receptive to them.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were classified as in support of these three proposals if they said they “strongly support” or “somewhat support” a proposal. Respondents could also say that they “somewhat oppose” or “strongly oppose,” or that they were “not familiar” with a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Many support Inflation Reduction Act climate change proposals" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0Riuu/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="347" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, more than 60 percent backed each of the three proposals, which included an increased emphasis on developing and using alternative energy sources, increased government regulation on corporations’ carbon emissions and giving tax credits to corporations that reduce carbon emissions. This included a majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents, too, save for increasing government regulation of business’ carbon emissions — although a plurality of Republicans still backed this idea (47 percent). Despite decently strong support for these proposals, Americans were largely unfamiliar with the Inflation Reduction Act, with only 38 percent stating that they were “very” or “somewhat” familiar with it.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options included “heard of, but that is about it,” “never heard of,” or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also found that, regardless of party, a respondent’s concern about climate change related to whether he or she had experienced unusual climate events. Republicans displayed a striking worry gap based on experience: Forty-six percent of those who had encountered extreme weather in the past five years said they were worried about climate change, compared with just 17 percent who hadn’t (a gap 8 percentage points larger than the one seen among Democrats, who already had a majority of respondents express worry about climate change independent of their experiences).<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme weather includes events such as extreme heat or cold, large wildfires, excessive rain, snow or drought. Respondents could select “yes,” “no,” “don’t know” or skip the question. Respondents were considered worried if they selected “very” or “somewhat” worried. They were also given the options of “not very worried,” “not at all worried,” “don’t know” or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> A 61-year-old man from Florida who identified as a person of color and a Republican said he had recently experienced an extreme weather event, noting particular concern over “the obvious destruction of natural resources due to excessive heat, diminished water reserves and unusual number of heat domes impacting climate across multiple continents.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-feel-about-republican-governors-sending-migrants-to-blue-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media spotlight hovering over immigration</a>, partisan divides toward immigration should also come as little surprise. When we asked if rules surrounding <em>legal</em> immigration should become “more strict,” “less strict” or “remain about the same,” a plurality of Republicans (43 percent) preferred stricter rules, while 36 percent preferred the status quo, and 12 percent backed looser regulations (the remainder didn’t know or skipped the question). By comparison, only 11 percent of Democrats favored more restrictive rules, with 73 percent split evenly between wanting things to remain about the same or become less strict. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Republicans were more unified on the issue of illegal immigration, as 78 percent said they wanted stricter rules toward those entering the country without proper authorization, compared to just 24 percent of Democrats who said the same. Michael Ritchie, a 27-year-old white man from Texas who identified as a conservative-libertarian independent, told us he wanted the government to incentivize legal immigration and disincentivize immigrants entering the country without legal permission. “I don't think there can ever be enough boots on the ground, per se, to completely secure the border,” he said. “But creating new policies or revamping immigration policies that would keep people from coming here simply for free rides or anything like that, but also make it easier for people to come here legally.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That aligns with another finding in our poll: Among the 1 in 5 respondents who named immigration as a top issue facing the country, 95 percent said undocumented immigration was a bigger issue for the country, compared with just 1 percent who said legal immigration. “The federal government abandoned its duty to protect our borders. The flow of immigration outside the proper process is a symptom that anything can cross it without control,” said a 41-year-old Hispanic man from New York who identified as Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And unlike the policy ideas to tackle climate change, Americans were more split on the best ways to address immigration concerns. When we asked whether respondents supported or opposed five immigration-related proposals, the only one that received majority support was the U.S. accepting more refugees from Ukraine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Americans are split on immigration" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/68w0R/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="398" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as we’ve <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/09/19/most-americans-express-support-for-taking-in-refugees-but-opinions-vary-by-party-and-other-factors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seen in other polls</a>, Americans view refugees differently based on where they’re from, as only 45 percent overall wanted to accept more refugees from Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Republicans were far and away most supportive of expanding the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico (80 percent) and further restricting the number of visas given out (62 percent), while solid majorities of Democrats opposed these ideas (75 percent and 60 percent, respectively). Outside of supporting an increase in Ukrainian refugees and opposing the building of a border wall between the U.S. and Canada, independents were split pretty evenly on these proposals. </p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not as if these issues stand apart from each other. A 24-year-old multiracial woman from California who identified as a Democrat said, “[Climate change] will have such a large impact on America’s future, yet it’s turned into a ‘political issue’ with so much disinformation being spread. People are refusing to make the changes necessary to reverse climate change because of politicians who tell them lies.” Others tied immigration to issues such as health care. “Illegal immigration is a burden on the health care, judicial, education, etc. systems in the U.S. Even legal immigration hurts the U.S. with overpopulation,” said a 63-year-old white man from New York who identified as a Republican. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And how these issues motivate or persuade voters to back one party or the other will be of vital importance when voters go to the polls in November. With fewer than six weeks until the midterms, 46 percent of respondents told us they were certain or almost certain to vote, up from 42 percent back in the first wave in the spring. And among those likely voters, Democrats and Republicans are about evenly split on the generic ballot, with 41 percent saying that they plan to vote for a Democrat and 40 percent planning to vote for a Republican (which is within the margin of error). Still, 17 percent of likely voters told us they intended to vote for a third-party option or didn't know how they planned to vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Based on their highly partisan nature in today’s political environment, climate change and immigration may not immediately jump out as issues that help undecided voters make up their minds. But we’ll get a firmer answer to this question next month, when we take a closer look at which issues voters are thinking about the most when they cast their ballots. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">With about a month before the midterm election, some Republican candidates across the country are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/republicans-tried-sidestep-issue-abortion-now-seeking-reset-rcna47415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrambling to moderate</a> their position on abortion. Supporting the recent Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — which overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the constitutional right to abortion — might be a winner in a Republican primary, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/2022-live-primary-election-race-results/2022/08/02/1115317596/kansas-voters-abortion-legal-reject-constitutional-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early signs</a> are that it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes it harder</a> to win a general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The conventional wisdom is that that’s in part because women <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/25/upshot/female-voters-dobbs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more motivated</a> to vote this election season thanks to the Supreme Court’s ruling. Conventional wisdom isn’t necessarily based on evidence, though. And while abortion is an increasingly important issue for women, there are signs it is galvanizing some men too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the Dobbs decision were motivating more women than men, then there’s a metric where that change would probably show up: <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the gender gap</a>. The gender gap is calculated by looking at the difference between the share of men and women who voted for a particular candidate or party. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-won-the-right-to-vote-100-years-ago-they-didnt-start-voting-differently-from-men-until-1980/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A higher share of women than men</a> have voted for Democrats in every midterm election since 1980, and in the past two midterm cycles the gap has been even bigger. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2018 midterm elections are a good example. That year, according to the exit polls, 59 percent of women — and only 47 percent of men — voted Democratic, which means the gender gap was historically wide, at nearly 12 percentage points.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It will be hard to exceed that gap, even with abortion at the forefront of many voters’ minds. Our analysis of polls conducted between June and September suggests that, yes, women are leaning heavily toward Democrats, while men are more likely to support Republicans. But in our polling average,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 24.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the size of the gender gap will vary depending on the poll. We looked at two Pew Research Center polls — one conducted in August 2018 and one in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/23/midterm-election-preferences-voter-engagement-views-of-campaign-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 2022</a> — and found that, in contrast with our average, the gender gap for Democrats among registered voters was a little wider in 2022 (6 points) than it was at the same point in 2018 (5 points), although it’s in the same ballpark. And it is noteworthy that Pew’s data says the 2022 gender gap is looking similar to the gap at the same point in 2018, given that Democrats have more electoral headwinds this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I expect that the [Supreme Court] ruling will lead women — especially Gen-Z women — to be far more engaged with the midterms than they would have been otherwise,” said <a href="https://www.melissadeckman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melissa Deckman</a>, the CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit polling organization. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the gender gap is a measure of one fairly specific thing: how women vote <em>relative</em> to men. And that can be complicated when it comes to abortion, because men and women overall have very similar views on the issue. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-dividing-line-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we’ve written before</a>, whether someone supports or opposes abortion rights has much more to do with their view of gender roles than their own gender. It’s possible, for example, that if left-leaning men are also unusually motivated to turn out, the gender gap could be smaller. A similar dynamic happened in 2020, when <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-gender-gap-may-have-shrunk-in-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">men moved toward President Joe Biden</a>, resulting in a smaller gender gap compared with 2016. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, the evidence about how men are responding to the Dobbs ruling is mixed. Over the past few months, polls have found <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-july-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/support-for-legalized-abortion-grows-since-dobbs-ruling-wsj-poll-shows-11662210020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over</a> again that rising concern over abortion is most dramatic among women, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/07/1121427463/more-women-are-registering-to-vote-how-could-that-affect-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> of surging voter registration have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/20/roe-abortion-dems-voter-registration-00057618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused on women</a>. <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/node/408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly Dittmar</a>, a political science professor at Rutgers University-Camden, said this makes sense because women — in particular, reproductive-aged women who support legal abortion — are more likely than men to feel personally threatened by the sudden loss of abortion rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there have also been reports of higher-than-usual voter registration among young men. An analysis of a series of polls by the nonpartisan firm PerryUndem,<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted using YouGov’s online panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> shared with FiveThirtyEight, before and after the Dobbs ruling found that men of reproductive age were more likely to prioritize “safe and legal abortion” as a voting issue. In our polling average,<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> we found that the gender gap for both Democrats and Republicans grew from June through September, but the gap grew more for Republicans than for Democrats. The two gaps are lopsided because men’s share of support for Democrats has grown as well as women’s, which means that the full magnitude of the shift doesn’t show up in that party’s side. Meanwhile, the shift in the Republicans’ gender gap shows something different: While the share of men supporting Republicans hasn’t changed meaningfully since June, the share of women supporting Republicans has declined, causing the gap to increase.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.fdu.edu/profiles/daniel_cassino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Cassino</a>, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, said that abortion-rights opponents might also be fired up by the Dobbs decision — but that’s less likely to show up as a change in the polls because those people are a solid part of the Republican base and more likely to vote in midterm elections to begin with. “This year, motivating those [anti-abortion voters] doesn’t really help Republicans, because they’re already motivated,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">He explained that reports of higher-than-usual voter registration among women and young voters are another complicating factor because it’s hard for pollsters to account for unexpected surges in turnout. Young voters tend to have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/645223716/on-the-sidelines-of-democracy-exploring-why-so-many-americans-dont-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly low turnout</a>, and pollsters sometimes rely on how demographic groups have behaved in the past <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2016/01/07/measuring-the-likelihood-to-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when they create models</a> to determine who’s likely to vote and who isn’t. If young women are unusually motivated to vote this year, that could throw off pollsters’ estimates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And then there are all the other factors that influence how people vote. Inflation and the economy <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/395408/abortion-moves-important-problem-list.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are other issues</a> that still consistently show up at the top of voters’ priority lists, and that’s not good for Democrats. Even though the economic outlook has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/13/business/economy/us-economy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved in some respects</a> over the past few months, <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_Politics_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202209021321.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll</a> found that only 26 percent of Americans said that Democrats would do a better job handling the economy, while 39 percent said Republicans would do a better job. (An additional 20 percent said that neither party would do a better job, and 12 percent said they’d do an equally good job.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So the question isn’t just whether abortion is motivating women more than men — it’s whether concern about abortion will lead voters who might be skeptical about the Democratic Party to vote for its candidates anyway. That group includes men as well as women, and their decisions will do a lot to shape how wide or narrow the gender gap turns out to be.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When Rep. Kurt Schrader, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-oregon-portland-congress-kurt-schrader-0bce17b40f80f96950358b5c4ee1862e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven-term incumbent</a> endorsed by President Biden, lost his primary in May, he joined a small but slowly growing list of congressional veterans defeated by progressive candidates with the backing of an increasingly influential campaign apparatus on the left. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This renewed progressive movement emerged following Sen. Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential primary run, yet despite some <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/historic-upset-28-year-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-unseats/story?id=56188380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile wins</a> in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-ayanna-pressleys-upset-win-in-massachusetts-isnt-really-like-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a>, its candidates <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-establishment-is-beating-the-progressive-wing-in-democratic-primaries-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost more often than they won</a> due to a scattershot strategy. Then, in 2020, when progressives <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got more targeted with their electoral strategy</a>, their win rate increased. But in 2022, the progressive movement appears to have taken a small step back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight tracked every endorsement made by a major progressive group for Senate, House and governor this primary season. We consider a candidate “progressive-backed” if they were endorsed by Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or any of the following groups: <a href="https://indivisible.org/candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indivisible</a>, <a href="https://justicedemocrats.com/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Democrats</a>, <a href="https://www.ourrevolution.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>, the <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunrise Movement</a> or the <a href="https://www.boldprogressives.org/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progressive Change Campaign Committee</a>.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some of these groups have local chapters, we counted only the candidates endorsed by national organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> We also looked at candidates backed by various groups and leaders representing the more moderate or establishment wing of the Democratic Party and found that, overall, the Democratic establishment has an edge in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/26/ohio-11thdistrict-primary-turner-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle for the party’s soul</a>. </p>



<h4><strong>Incumbents largely staved off progressive challengers</strong></h4>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Eleven candidates endorsed by at least one of those progressive organizations or people went into the 2022 election cycle hoping to topple an incumbent.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes two who were incumbents themselves, Reps. Marie Newman and Andy Levin. New congressional maps threw them into the same district as their fellow Reps. Sean Casten and Haley Stevens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> Only one of them won: Schrader’s opponent, attorney Jamie McLeod-Skinner. By contrast, in 2020, progressives won three out of 17 such battles.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of these races, one of the most closely watched was in Texas’s 28th Congressional District, where progressive attorney Jessica Cisneros took on Rep. Henry Cuellar for the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/05/jessica-cisneros-henry-cuellar-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second time</a>. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/24/jessica-cisneros-henry-cuellar-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuellar is a long-time moderate in the party</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/texas-primary-candidates-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an opponent of abortion rights</a>. In 2020 Cisneros came within 4 percentage points of unseating him. Cisneros and her supporters were looking to replicate the success of Rep. Marie Newman, who defeated eight-term Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in 2020 after she lost to him by 2 points in 2018. (Lipinski also opposed abortion rights.) But despite all seven progressive entities we tracked being in her corner, Cisneros came up short: After forcing a runoff, she lost to Cuellar by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/21/henry-cuellar-jessica-cisneros-south-texas-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 289 votes</a>. (Newman is out this cycle too. She lost to fellow incumbent Rep. Sean Casten.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Incumbents’ myriad advantages help them <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">win primaries most of the time</a>. For one, they (usually) have the support of party leadership. For instance, in the race between Cisneros and Cuellar, Cuellar was endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn and House Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries. And while Biden does not typically issue primary endorsements as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-endorsees-have-started-losing-more-but-dont-read-into-that-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his predecessor did</a>, the president made <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Endorsements_by_Joe_Biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three exceptions for House candidates this cycle</a>, all for incumbents facing progressive primary challengers: Schrader and Reps. Shontel Brown and Danny Davis. Schrader lost, but both Brown and Davis prevailed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Races like these that pit a progressive against an establishment Democrat are watched closely as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-16/oregon-congress-primary-democrats-schrader-mcleod-skinner-left-vs-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referenda on the future direction of the party</a>. And among more moderate Democrats, progressive losses are seized upon to suggest that the party’s base is still pro-establishment — or at least satisfied with the status quo. For instance, Jeffries, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-house-incumbents-challengers/2021/07/13/5dad62a4-e327-11eb-8aa5-5662858b696e_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a known critic of the progressives in his party</a>, was asked in August if he thought the progressive movement had stopped gaining ground. <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/08/hakeem-jeffries-again-challenges-left-eve-primary/376162/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He responded</a>, “Politically, the left did have some success in primarying Democratic incumbents in 2018, and 2020 … But a lot of their electoral momentum began to dissipate shortly after Biden was elected … Perhaps the voters are sending us a message.”</p>



<h4><strong>Progressives had more luck in open-seat races</strong></h4>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jeffries’s analysis ignores that progressive-backed candidates do much better in primaries without an incumbent on the ballot. For example, in 2022, the progressive-backed candidate won 14 out of the 25 open-seat primaries in which they ran — good for a 56 percent win rate. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And some of these were pretty big wins. For instance, after Rep. Mike Doyle announced his intention not to run for reelection in Pennsylvania’s safely Democratic 12th Congressional District, most progressive groups lined up behind state Rep. Summer Lee. As a result, Lee edged out Doyle’s chosen successor by less than 1 point. Likewise, in Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race, progressive-backed Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes was such a formidable candidate that his closest rivals could not gain traction and <a href="https://www.wpr.org/once-competitive-race-wisconsins-democratic-u-s-senate-primary-all-decided" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out one by one</a>. That eventually led to his primary coronation (though it remains to be seen whether he will win the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general election in November</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, progressives also won fewer of these primaries than they did in 2020. That year, their win rate in incumbent-less primaries was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a robust 69 percent</a> (22 wins in 32 tries). Part of the decline could be because of the emergence of a well-funded opposition mobilizing against them. For example, progressives endorsed two congressional candidates in North Carolina, former state Sen. Erica Smith and Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam, who failed to win their primaries. In both those elections, the same foe stepped up to block them: the <a href="https://businessnc.com/new-aipac-money-boosting-don-davis-valerie-foushee-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Democracy Project</a>, a pro-Israel super PAC funded by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The United Democracy Project spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00799031/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $24.3 million</a> this election cycle helping to elect moderate Democrats over progressives, with their biggest outlay coming on behalf of former Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Glenn Ivey over former Rep. Donna Edwards in Maryland’s 4th Congressional District.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Edwards is ideologically progressive, interestingly, none of the seven progressive entities we tracked endorsed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> The super PAC’s efforts were not always successful — it also spent heavily against Lee, for example — but it did win more races it got involved in than progressives did: seven out of nine, or 78 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, progressives’ win rate was far lower than the win rate of candidates supported by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official House campaign arm of the Democratic Party. All 18 candidates who were put on the DCCC’s “<a href="https://redtoblue.dccc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red to Blue</a>” list before their primaries advanced to the general election.<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Governors Association does not endorse in open-seat primaries, and in a departure from past practice, nor did the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, the party went head-to-head against progressives only once: in New York’s 11th Congressional District, where former Rep. Max Rose defeated Army veteran Brittany Ramos DeBarros. Ramos DeBarros was endorsed by Indivisible, Our Revolution and the PCCC. In fact, 13 of the DCCC’s Red to Blue candidates faced no Democratic opposition in their primaries. This is a good reminder that progressive and establishment candidates aren’t necessarily in opposition. </p>



<h4><strong>Different progressive groups have different strategies</strong></h4>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also important to remember that not all progressive groups are the same. Some groups and leaders still see the value in endorsing a longer-shot candidate with little chance of winning to influence agenda-setting or remind more establishment candidates that their party’s tent is big. Others, by contrast, are more strategic, hoping to funnel their resources into the races they feel they have the best chance of winning. As a result, certain progressive endorsers have better records than others. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, Justice Democrats have a 100 percent win rate in incumbent-less primaries (three for three), up from 67 percent in 2020 (two for three) and a marked improvement from 2018 (32 percent), when they endorsed more broadly (50 candidates). As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressive-groups-are-getting-more-selective-in-targeting-incumbents-is-it-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we wrote in 2020</a>, of all the progressive groups emerging since 2016, Justice Democrats, in particular, seem most targeted in their recruitment efforts and deliberate about their endorsements, which helps explain their success. Ocasio-Cortez (three for four) and the Sunrise Movement (three for five) also succeeded with limited endorsement strategies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the progressives who were a bit freer with their endorsements, Sanders did the best with an 80 percent win rate in incumbent-less primaries (eight for 10), up from 75 percent in 2020 (six for eight) and 56 percent in 2018 (five for nine). This could reflect Sanders’s status as the godfather of the party’s progressive wing, but given the growth in his <em>own</em> win rate, it could be the product of a shrewder endorsement strategy. Finally, the PCCC was the only progressive endorser we looked at with a losing record (36 percent, or four for 11).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 primaries continued to display all the factors working against progressives — factors that have kept the soul of the Democratic Party fairly establishment-friendly. But it’s also important to remember that progressives are playing the long game. They may not have won as often as their opponents. Still, many <em>did</em> win their primaries and will join a growing number <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/greg-casar-summer-lee-delia-ramirez-house-progressives-1389261/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already on the inside</a>. It may not be a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congressional-republicans-left-office-in-droves-under-trump-just-how-conservative-are-their-replacements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sudden transformation</a>, but progressives are slowly gaining strength within the Democratic Party with every passing election cycle.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the 2020 election cycle, Democrats’ decades-long dream of winning Georgia finally became a reality. The state voted for a Democrat, Joe Biden, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/joe-biden-wins-georgia-flipping-state-democrats-74308658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the presidential race</a> for the <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first time since 1992</a>, and it elected <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/odds-georgia-democrats-make-history-senate-runoffs/story?id=75095109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two Democrats to the U.S. Senate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking back, it’s hard to pinpoint what turned Georgia blue. Was it antipathy toward then-President Donald Trump? After all, anti-Trump sentiment among Democrats was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/17/democrats-are-twice-likely-republicans-name-trump-reason-their-pick-congressional-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly high</a> in 2018 and 2020. Then again, the wheels for a Democratic takeover were already set in motion when the party’s gubernatorial nominee, Stacey Abrams, pioneered a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-democrats-may-have-found-their-own-southern-strategy-a-black-centric-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new playbook focused on Black voters</a> in 2018, something that nearly won her the governorship that year and motivated more Georgians to vote blue in 2020 and 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, a lot of what happened in 2020 can be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-new-great-migration-is-bringing-black-americans-back-to-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credited to Black voters</a>. In the prior two decades, Georgia slowly tilted toward Democrats, in large part because of an influx of Black Americans moving back to the South since the 1970s, a <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/great-migration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reversal of the Great Migration</a> that started in the 1910s. This trend has been particularly pronounced in Georgia.

<p data-paragraph="main">“Not only do you have a higher percentage of Black people coming in, but they are geographically dispersed. And they’re largely voting for Democrats. So, from a political perspective, the map is changing every day. I wouldn’t necessarily call Georgia a blue state, but it certainly is purple, and it can go blue during any given election,” said Andre Perry, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 election forecast,<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate race is a toss-up</a>, while the governor’s race is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more squarely in Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s column</a>. Still, though, in a state that has changed so much in the past 20-odd years, a lot may come down to how many — and if — Black voting-age Georgians cast their ballots.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, both parties have made an intentional effort to reach Black voters this year. Abrams’s campaign, for instance, has hosted conversations called “Stacey and the Fellas” to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfowler/2022/09/12/stacy-abrams-talks-georgia--gubernatorial-race-and-expanding-the-electorate-days-before-the-midterms/?sh=52bd6f964076" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engage Black men</a> in the state. And in an August campaign event, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-stacey-abrams-if-black-men-vote-for-me-ill-win-georgia/RSMN2D6JNNG2VBENLYE6H7COAM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she bluntly explained why</a>: “If Black men vote for me, I’ll win Georgia.” But Spencer Crew, a professor of history at George Mason University, told us it’s clear that Republicans are also trying to appeal to Black voters. For example, prominent Republicans’ decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/politics/hershel-walker-georgia-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back former NFL star Herschel Walker</a>, a Black man, to challenge Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, also a Black man, is “a recognition from the party that Black voters are important and that they’re trying to figure out ways to tap into that electorate.” It’s possible there will be an opening for Republicans, too, as Black voters have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-falling-poll-numbers-georgia/2021/10/10/3606c99e-2002-11ec-8200-5e3fd4c49f5e_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soured on Biden</a> and a renowned celebrity like Walker could be serious competition.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But either party’s success will likely hinge on how they perform in Georgia’s capital city, Atlanta. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Case in point: In 2020, the counties in Atlanta’s metro areas<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined as U.S. Census core-based statistical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> that saw the biggest increases in the number of Black Americans casting their ballots also saw some of the strongest shifts toward Biden and were key to helping him win. About 32 percent — or over 136,000 — more Black voters showed up in 2020 than in 2016, when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was on the ballot.</p>

Since 2000, the growth in Atlanta’s Black voting-age population has been close to four times as fast as the growth of its white<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined throughout this article as single-race and not Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a> voting-age population. Moreover, the city’s surrounding metro area has been a center of Black voting-age population growth in the U.S., with close to 700,000 more Black Americans 18 years old or over calling the Atlanta area home since 2000. Put another way, this 6-percentage-point increase in the area’s Black voting-age population has been a pivotal factor in its politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“For the Black community, Atlanta is clearly an attractive place in the South to go live. And clearly that’s impacting the political environment in and around the city as well and the surrounding suburbs,” Crew said. The election of two Democratic senators following a very close race for governor “shows that the state’s demographics are changing and the organizing of Black voters is shifting the balance of power.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cobb and Gwinnett counties, the Atlanta area’s most-populated urban counties<a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index, calculated as the natural logarithm of the average number of people living within a 5-mile radius of a given resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a> after Fulton, have grown by over 200,000 Black Americans of voting age in 20 years. In 2000, the two counties were heavily Republican and had an average vote-share margin of R+27 in that presidential election. But by 2020, the average vote share had swung 16 points toward Democrats. </p>

And some counties, like Fulton, haven’t seen sharp increases in Black voters but have still moved to the left. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that racial demographics alone cannot tell us everything about Georgia’s political landscape. Educational attainment has also been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/?ex_cid=story-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a driving factor</a>. It all comes down to whether these factors are reflected in who turns out. We can see this in the suburbs, which were simply vital for Biden in 2020, when he won Georgia by close to 12,000 votes. As the chart below shows, Democrats’ biggest suburban gains in vote margin from 2016 happened in counties where Black voters turned out in high numbers, underscoring the importance of Black suburban voters.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="852" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mejia.samuels.BLACK-VOTERS-GA.0926_4-desktop.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mejia.samuels.BLACK-VOTERS-GA.0926_4-desktop.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mejia.samuels.BLACK-VOTERS-GA.0926_4-desktop.png?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mejia.samuels.BLACK-VOTERS-GA.0926_4-desktop.png?w=2048 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1058" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mejia.samuels.BLACK-VOTERS-GA.0926_4-mobile.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mejia.samuels.BLACK-VOTERS-GA.0926_4-mobile.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mejia.samuels.BLACK-VOTERS-GA.0926_4-mobile.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mejia.samuels.BLACK-VOTERS-GA.0926_4-mobile.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The reversal of the Great Migration in recent decades has been <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-new-great-migration-is-bringing-black-americans-back-to-the-south" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propelled largely by young, college-educated Black Americans</a>, whose votes were key to Biden’s winning Atlanta, which was in turn important to his success in the state overall: 60 percent of Georgia’s electorate came from the capital city’s metro area.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Those middle-income Black people who truly fit the profile of the ‘suburban mom or dad’ like to see leaders who look like them,” said Perry, of Brookings. “So they’re electing Black people in the counties and municipalities they’re moving into. So there is also a power shift that’s going on at the local level that can bubble up to affect statewide races.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s no question, then, that Black voters have transformed Georgia’s electorate and put it at the forefront of southern Black political might. This is especially true in the state’s suburbs, which have gotten <em>really</em> competitive. Most suburbs in Atlanta have shifted toward Democrats by 31 points or so in 20 years and have gained, on average, more than 315,000 voting-age Black Americans, far outpacing the growth of the white voting-age population by 200,000. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“White voters are leaving the suburbs, and Black Americans are moving into the state’s cities and suburbs,” said William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “And you’re seeing that big time in Atlanta, which is essentially a prototype of what the Black population can do in terms of changing not only the demography but also the <em>political </em>demography of different parts of the state.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Frey told FiveThirtyEight that the white population has declined since 2016, especially in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Henry County, for example, lost nearly 13,500 white people while gaining more than 30,000 Black people between 2016 and 2021. “There are several counties that have had absolute declines of their white population and gains of [their] Black one, like Gwinnett and Cobb counties,” he said. This, according to Frey, suggests a significant share of the state’s white voters are moving out of the suburbs and urban areas and into more rural parts of the state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Keneshia Grant, a professor of political science at Howard University, went one step further describing what may happen if the rate of Black people moving into Atlanta remains high, saying there could be “a tipping point at which the number of people living in these metropolitan areas or metropolitan-adjacent areas will be high enough to overcome the rural areas.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider what happened in Georgia in the last presidential and Senate elections, particularly Warnock’s defeat of Republican Kelly Loeffler in the Senate runoffs. His win was due, in part, to almost every single suburb in the state <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifting further to the left</a> from the November 2020 presidential election, with nearly 92 percent of November’s Black voters turning out again in January 2021 for the runoffs, but Warnock also benefited from more Republican-heavy parts of the state <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-2021s-biggest-upset-elections-tell-us-about-the-losing-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not turning out to vote</a>. Both he and Jon Ossoff, the other Democrat who won in the Senate runoffs, improved on Biden’s margins, especially in counties with the largest share of Black voters.</p>

But, once again, the suburbs are likely to be important for both parties as they fight for control of the U.S. Senate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Perry, there’s a good chance that having multiple Black candidates on the ticket will energize voters in ways they weren’t previously. Abrams’s close election in 2018, he added, also might encourage Black Democrats to go out and vote, even in a midterm year. Nationally, turnout among Black voters is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1096123/voter-turnout-midterms-by-ethnicity-historical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically lower</a> than that of voters overall in both midterm and general elections. But it’s possible Georgia may see higher turnout this year, as the state saw an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-high-turnout-in-georgia-doesnt-mean-voting-restrictions-havent-had-an-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uptick in early voting</a> in the May primaries. That said, it’s still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-high-turnout-in-georgia-doesnt-mean-voting-restrictions-havent-had-an-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too early to know</a> how the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-georgias-new-voting-law-is-such-a-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictive voting law</a> Georgia recently passed will affect turnout in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But don’t miss the forest for the trees. That higher early-voting turnout in the Georgia primaries was among <a href="https://sos.ga.gov/news/georgia-election-law-results-record-early-voting-turnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both Democrats <em>and </em>Republicans</a>. At this point, it doesn’t seem as if Republicans have made inroads with Black voters in the state, as a Sept. 8-12 poll from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3855" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a> found that Black likely voters overwhelmingly support Abrams (91 percent) and Warnock (92 percent) over their GOP opponents. But the overall toplines show just how competitive these statewide races are: The gubernatorial race showed Abrams behind Kemp by just 2 points, while the Senate matchup had Warnock leading Walker 52 percent to 46 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, greater turnout among Black voters won’t guarantee Democratic victories up and down the ballot, as a lot of other factors are at play in Georgia. But as Perry told FiveThirtyEight, recent Democratic victories in the state have also energized Black voters. “Once you start getting a few people elected and get some statewide wins under your belt, then you start believing that you belong and that those seats are yours,” Perry said. “There is a palpable empowerment that Black people are feeling in Georgia like they’ve never felt before.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The Deluxe version of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight midterm forecast</a> just shifted slightly, but it’s not because of anything that happened in politics. Rather, it’s because we identified — and fixed — an error related to missing data that was leading to incorrect odds for several Senate, House and gubernatorial races. We wanted to take some time to explain what happened, how we identified it and the effect the correction had.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Thursday, <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a> — one of three election forecasters whose race ratings factor into the Deluxe version of the FiveThirtyEight midterm forecast — <a href="https://twitter.com/kkondik/status/1573028316981886977?s=20&amp;t=pYC6OhjJG8aZYBRDwMps1g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved the Ohio 9th Congressional District</a> from “toss-up” to “leans Democratic.” When we went to input this change into our forecast, though, we found that our spreadsheet of race ratings was missing any Crystal Ball rating for the Ohio 9th whatsoever. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Upon closer inspection, we discovered we were actually missing Crystal Ball ratings for dozens of races. We used to have this data, but a look back at old files shows it was accidentally deleted on June 30.<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see a sudden change in our forecast odds on that date for &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/arizona/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;certain races&lt;/a&gt;, but it went unnoticed because June 30 was the day we launched the forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>32</sup></a> (Ratings from the other expert race raters, <a href="http://www.insideelections.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Elections</a> and the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook Political Report</a>, were unaffected.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Friday, we re-collected the Crystal Ball ratings data and added it back into the model — and the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deluxe version of the forecast</a> has changed slightly as a result. (The Lite and Classic versions of the forecast, which don’t incorporate expert race ratings, remain unchanged.) Democrats’ overall odds of winning the House increased by 0.7 percentage points to 32-in-100, but their odds of winning the Senate decreased by 0.5 points to 70-in-100. More importantly, though, some individual races did shift significantly. Here’s every race whose odds changed by at least 1 percentage point.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">We know how much readers rely on our forecast to be as accurate as possible, and we’re aware that, for some people — politicians, campaign staffers and voters alike — the forecast represents something more than just a number on a page. So we’re taking steps to ensure this error doesn’t recur. We usually use an automated process to collect and update race ratings, but we’ve turned that off so that we can manually check all future ratings changes from all three election forecasters. And while we’re still unsure how the data got deleted, we are actively investigating to ensure we patch up any systematic problems in our workflow. We hope you’ll continue to use and trust our forecast.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ever since we launched our election model in late June</a>, it has moved entirely in one direction: toward Democrats. Pretty much every week, they’ve either gained ground in our forecast or held steady. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This week has been more in the “held steady” category. In the Deluxe version of our model, Democrats’ chances of keeping the Senate are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71 percent</a>, while their chances of holding the House are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">31 percent</a>. Neither number has meaningfully changed from a week ago.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Democrats’ position has continually improved, I’ve tended to focus on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimistic scenarios for Democrats</a>. Frankly, I’ve been looking for an opportunity to reiterate why Republicans could still have a pretty good midterm. They are, after all, reasonably clear favorites to flip the House, and a 30 percent chance to flip the Senate is nothing to sneeze at, either. That 30 percent chance is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty much the same one</a> our model gave to Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton on Election Day in 2016.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that Republicans <em>could win</em> doesn’t mean that their situation is <em>improving</em>. I’ve seen <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/18/democrats-midterm-reality-check" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-polls-tighten-border-crime-grow-issues-note/story?id=90201864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bcf24508-37b5-40e7-b976-2b9bb79c3720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> about Republican momentum in the polls that I don’t think are yet justified in the evidence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s leave our probabilistic forecast aside for now and just look at the polls themselves. Specifically, we’ll look at what our polling averages say as I write this on Sept. 22 and how that compares to one month ago, on Aug. 22. A fair amount has happened since then: The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its student loan forgiveness program on Aug. 24; there’s been some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/13/business/markets-inflation-stocks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fairly negative inflation news and other economic data</a>; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/politics/marthas-vineyard-massachusetts-migrants-planes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 50 migrants to Martha’s Vineyard</a>; Russia is facing significant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/world/europe/russia-retreat-northeast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setbacks in its war with Ukraine</a>; and campaigns are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-spend-millions-tv-ads-midterms-why-doesnt-trump-2022-09-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicking into higher gear in many states</a> after Labor Day.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First up, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic Congressional ballot</a>. Democrats currently lead by 1.9 percentage points in our average. That reflects continued improvement from Aug. 22, when they led by 0.4 percentage points.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="920" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/generic-ballot-2-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/generic-ballot-2-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/generic-ballot-2-3.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/generic-ballot-2-3.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Our generic ballot average, however, is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-a-new-less-volatile-version-of-our-generic-ballot-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designed to be somewhat slow-moving</a> — so if there’s been a recent reversal in the improving electoral environment for Democrats, it may be slow to detect it. Our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential approval average</a> is more aggressive, by contrast. As of Sept. 22 at 5 p.m. Eastern, Biden has a 42.5 percent approval rating and a 53.0 percent disapproval rating. That’s mediocre, although similar to where several other presidents have been in advance of their first midterm. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="920" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/biden-approval-rating-2-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/biden-approval-rating-2-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/biden-approval-rating-2-3.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/biden-approval-rating-2-3.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Nonetheless, those numbers are improved from Aug. 22, when Biden had a 40.9 approval rating against 54.3 percent disapproval.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What about individual Senate and gubernatorial races? FiveThirtyEight publishes <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling averages in these races</a> once there are a sufficient number of polls. Technically speaking, these polling averages are calculated separately from the version used by our forecast model, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performs various fancy adjustments to the polls</a> (for instance, our model adjusts outdated polls based on changes in the generic ballot). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the purposes of this article’s exercise, though, the comparative simplicity of our standalone polling averages should work well. So let’s look at all races where there have been a) at least two polls between the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade on June 24<a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;clearly seems to have been an inflection point in the race for Congress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>33</sup></a> and Aug. 22, and b) at least two polls between Aug. 22 and now. In these states, we have enough data to establish a post-Dobbs baseline and to see whether there’s been a meaningful shift. Eleven Senate races meet this criteria;<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I excluded Utah, where the race is between an independent and a Republican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> here is how the polling average has changed in each one:</p>

 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">If you squint, you can see some movement toward Republicans. On Aug. 22, Democrats led by 4.7 percentage points in these races on average, and now they lead by 3.8 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But few individual races have moved all that much. Republicans have gained at least a full percentage point in Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin, while Democrats have done so in New Hampshire.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly enough, this movement has often been in line with what the “fundamentals” in each race might have predicted. Most <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expert groups</a> had rated races such as Wisconsin and Nevada as tossups, even though polls had shown Democrats ahead there. So this may just be reversion to the mean, given that neither race had been polled terribly often, rather than any actual shift in voter sentiment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, a look at gubernatorial races, using the same parameters as we did for the Senate races:</p>

 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">These don’t show any shift toward Republicans. On average, Democrats led by 1.4 percentage points on Aug. 22, and they lead by 1.9 percentage points now. Some individual races have changed, of course, but these moves have been in either direction. Democrats have gained at least a percentage point in Florida, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, while Republicans have done so in Arizona, Michigan, Massachusetts and New York.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We could go race by race and debate which of these shifts are “real” and which reflect noisy or low-quality polling. But that’s beside the point, which is that there hasn’t been any <em>systematic </em>rebound by Republicans. In the 24 gubernatorial and Senate races listed here, Democrats led by an average of 2.9 percentage points on Aug. 22, and they lead by 2.8 percentage points now. There’s been essentially no change, in other words.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, that may not be true in the future. It may be too soon to see the impact of recent news stories in the polls. I tend to think DeSantis’s stunt in sending migrants to Massachusetts will engender more of a reaction on cable news and on Twitter than it will necessarily matter to normal swing voters. But a sustained focus on immigration could <a href="https://twitter.com/richardmskinner/status/1572597839275991042?s=20&amp;t=igJI5MbN_n9Ka7AIwGNYpw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be worse for Democrats</a> than one on other issues such as abortion. And as I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last week</a>, our model does expect the political environment to get slightly better for Republicans between now and November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mostly, though, we’ve reached that part of the election cycle where you ought to be wary of media narratives about which party has “momentum.” There are a lot of competitive elections this cycle, and since Labor Day, we’ve started to see a lot more polling. It’s very, very easy to cherry-pick your way into a story that fits your preconceived notions about the race. But when there’s a major, nationwide shift in the race — as there was toward Democrats after the Dobbs decision — you usually don’t have to squint to see it.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">What effect is social media having on our politics and society more broadly? According to critics, we’re living through an unregulated era of social media that will one day look as outdated as tobacco did in its pre-regulation era.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In his new book, “<a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/max-fisher/the-chaos-machine/9780316703314/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Chaos Machine: The Inside Story of How Social Media Rewired Our Minds and Our World</a>” New York Times reporter Max Fisher explores how social media impacts the psychology of its users and changes how people think, behave and communicate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Galen Druke talks to Fisher about his book and why he believes this is leading to social and political crises in the U.S. and around the world.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">When nearly 50 migrants arrived unexpectedly in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, last week, it rekindled the ever-smoldering debate around immigration in America. This was exactly what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/09/15/marthas-vineyard-desantis-migrants-venezuela/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intended</a> when his administration chartered the two flights to relocate the migrants, at least <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/17/1123629690/migrants-sent-to-marthas-vineyard-are-being-rehoused-in-cape-cod" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of whom were asylum seekers</a>. This move followed in the footsteps of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/us/texas-migrants-bus-washington-dc-new-york/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whose administration has been relocating migrants</a> to liberal places like New York City and Washington, D.C., for months. And just as Americans were divided over these specific actions, they continue to be split on the issue of immigration more broadly — and often hold surprising and contradictory views. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/xeu4apb94g/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from The Economist/YouGov</a> fielded in the days after the Martha’s Vineyard flights found that Americans were evenly split over whether or not they approved of Texas and Florida sending undocumented immigrants to northern cities without giving those cities notice: Forty-four percent “somewhat” or “strongly” approved, while 44 percent “somewhat” or “strongly” disapproved (12 percent were not sure). Democrats were more likely to disapprove of the relocation efforts, with 71 percent disapproving, while three-quarters of Republicans approved. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/09/21/gop-governors-interstate-migrant-maneuvers-divide-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from Politico/Morning Consult</a> found that 42 percent of registered voters said it was appropriate that “some Republican governors from states along the U.S.-Mexico border have been sending thousands of migrants to liberal states and cities in the U.S.,” with another 41 percent saying it was inappropriate. There wasn’t a strong consensus on either side of the political aisle, however. Fifty-nine percent of Democrats said it was inappropriate, and 66 percent of Republicans said it was appropriate, but a quarter of Democrats and 1 in 5 Republicans took the alternate view. And <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/09/19/dcebc/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a separate poll from YouGov</a>, Americans were likewise divided when asked whether they approved or disapproved of Southern Republican governors sending undocumented migrants to Democratic-controlled cities without giving those cities notice. This division held even in different regions of the country. About 41 percent of Americans in each listed region (Northeast, Midwest, South and West) approved of these moves from GOP governors, and roughly 44 percent in each region disapproved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ views on this specific news story reflect broader divides around immigration. When asked <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/18/most-americans-see-border-situation-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an August Economist/YouGov poll</a> whether immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship, or whether they should be required to leave the country, Americans were split 44 percent to 41 percent. They were similarly divided in other <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/09/19/dcebc/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov data</a> from this week: Thirty-seven percent of Americans said undocumented immigrants were treated “fairly,” and 38 percent said “unfairly.” And in <a href="https://echeloninsights.com/in-the-news/april-22-omnibus-immigration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an April survey from Republican pollster Echelon Insights</a>, likely voters were evenly split on a number of immigration-related questions. Thirty percent said immigration should stay at its current level, while 45 percent said it should be decreased and 15 percent said it should be increased. Meanwhile, 39 percent strongly supported building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, while 32 percent strongly opposed it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Where Americans find consensus on immigration is in the belief that illegal immigration is a problem in the first place. In <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/18/most-americans-see-border-situation-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that August Economist/YouGov poll</a>, 59 percent of Americans said the current situation at the U.S.-Mexico border is a crisis. While Republicans were very likely to say so (81 percent did), a plurality of Democrats (45 percent) agreed the situation is a crisis. A majority of Americans also said it was “completely” or “somewhat” true that the U.S. is experiencing an “invasion” at its southern border, according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/npr-immigration-perceptions-august-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an NPR/Ipsos poll conducted in July</a>. At the same time, in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/09/19/most-americans-express-support-for-taking-in-refugees-but-opinions-vary-by-party-and-other-factors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an August Pew Research Center survey</a>, a sizable majority of Americans (72 percent) said taking in refugees should be a “very” or “somewhat” important goal for U.S. immigration policy, and this is true for both Democrats (85 percent) and Republicans (58 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Concerns about immigration are clearly shared among Americans of all political persuasions, and the recent relocation of migrants to Martha’s Vineyard has helped bring it back into focus. While the percentage has gone down over time, a majority of Americans “mostly” or “completely” agreed with the statement that “the current increase of migrants attempting to enter the United States on the southern border due to the fact that Joe Biden was elected president,” according to <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/Fox_June-10-13-2022_Complete_National_Topline_June-30-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a June Fox News/Beacon Research/Shaw &amp; Company Research poll</a>. And in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/poll-gop-winning-economy-immigration-democrats-are-ahead-abortion-heal-rcna48297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an NBC News/Hart Research Associates/Public Opinion Strategies survey conducted earlier this month</a>, a majority of registered voters (56 percent) said the Republican Party better handles border security, and a plurality (46 percent) preferred the GOP on immigration. It’s possible Republicans like DeSantis are doing everything they can to put the issue front and center just weeks away from the midterm elections in an attempt to change the channel from issues less favorable to Republicans, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-keep-failing-to-pass-abortion-bans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like abortion</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites </strong></h2>



<ul><li>A recent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-biden-age-poll-term-limits-medical-checks-poll-2022-9">Insider/Morning Consult poll</a> found that almost half of Americans (41 percent) thought the age of our political leaders, such as the president and those in Congress and on the Supreme Court, is a major problem, and another 37 percent considered it a minor one — a breakdown that remained fairly consistent across political leanings. Seventy-five percent of Americans were in favor of introducing age maximums for members of Congress, too. Additionally, a majority agreed that a president should “definitely” undergo a physical and mental assessment to take office, with Americans ages 55 to 64 (71 percent) most likely to say so. </li><li>Older Americans were more likely than younger Americans to say that formerly incarcerated people who have served their prison sentence deserve to be considered for jobs, according to a Sept. 16 <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/legal/survey-results/daily/2022/09/16/0d1e1/1">YouGov survey</a>. Eighty-two percent of adults ages 65 and older agreed, compared with 67 percent of those ages 18 to 29. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/legal/survey-results/daily/2022/09/16/0d1e1/2">Additional data from YouGov</a> also found that nearly all Americans over 65 (93 percent) said that it’s at least somewhat harder for formerly incarcerated individuals to find employment, while about three-quarters of adults ages 18 to 29. </li><li>Americans were down on both capitalism and socialism, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/09/19/modest-declines-in-positive-views-of-socialism-and-capitalism-in-u-s/">per a survey conducted by Pew Research Center</a> in August. Slightly more than half (57 percent) of Americans have a “very” or “somewhat” positive stance toward capitalism, which is down from 65 percent in May 2019. On the flip side, 36 percent of Americans today held a positive view of socialism, which is lower than the 42 percent who approved three years ago. Still, a higher share of adults (65 percent) agreed socialism at least somewhat helps people meet basic housing, health and food needs, compared with those who said the same about capitalism (47 percent). Meanwhile, 64 percent also said that capitalism could provide people with equal opportunities to be successful, while only 52 percent said the same about socialism. </li><li>A <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/entertainment/articles-reports/2022/09/14/half-of-americans-enjoy-true-crime-yougov-poll">YouGov poll</a> conducted Aug. 29-Sept. 5 found that half of Americans enjoy true crime content, a breakdown that constitutes a notably higher share of women (58 percent) than men (42 percent). The study also showed a gender breakdown in the who is engaging with more violent topics within the genre: Sixty percent of women reported ever consuming murder-related true crime, while only 43 percent of men said the same. One set of responses, in particular, to another question in the survey might help elucidate that breakdown: Seventy percent of women agreed that the genre helps listeners become “more vigilant and safety-conscious” in their own lives. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Twenty years ago, Tallie Ben Daniel was a college student wandering the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz, when she came across a bumper sticker that read “Free Palestine.” Born to an Israeli family in Los Angeles, Ben Daniel had never heard the phrase before. “I had zero context for what that meant. And I didn’t understand,” she recalled. “Free Palestine from what?” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, Ben Daniel is an advocate for Palestinian human rights. She’s currently the managing director of Jewish Voice for Peace, an organization that challenges the way the Israeli government treats Palestinians. But her past confusion makes sense against the backdrop of the early 2000s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In general, U.S. support for Israel was a common, unquestioned stance on both sides of the aisle, while the aftermath of 9/11 only <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/09/1035418760/how-the-events-of-9-11-still-affect-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deepened Americans’ rapport with Israel</a> from the lens of solidarity against terrorism claimed by Islamic extremists. Even among those concerned for the Palestinians, many <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oslo/etc/cron.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clung to the fleeting optimism</a> that the Oslo Accords of the 1990s could yield a peaceful two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2001, when <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350393/key-trends-views-israel-palestinians.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup polled</a> Americans on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, views were clear and consistent: Only 16 percent of Americans sympathized more with the Palestinians, while 51 percent sympathized more with the Israelis. Back then, this wasn’t even a particularly partisan issue — only 18 percent of Democrats sympathized more with Palestinians. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two decades later, though, the landscape has changed. The share of Americans with more sympathy toward the Palestinians has ticked up to 26 percent. And that support has more than doubled among Democrats: Today, 38 percent report feeling more sympathy for the Palestinians. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A confluence of factors over the past decade seems to be driving this shift. Social media has changed how war is witnessed across the globe — especially among young people — and a growing awareness of social inequities in the U.S. may be reshaping how some Americans perceive conflict internationally, too. But most of all, the Palestinian-Israeli question has become a topic that embodies an intra-party identity issue for Democrats, one that has increasingly pushed liberals to reconsider what constitutes progressive politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/israel-gaza-conflict/story?id=24552237" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer 2014</a> marked one of the <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most deadly episodes of violence in Gaza</a>. In May that year, Israel Defense Forces soldiers <a href="https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20140612_autopsy_finds_nadim_nawarah_killed_by_live_ammunition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed two Palestinian teenagers</a>. In June, <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v36/n15/mouin-rabbani/israel-mows-the-lawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped</a> while hitchhiking in the West Bank and ultimately killed, and the IDF launched a full-force defense operation in response. According to the <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/key-figures-2014-hostilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a>, 73 Israelis were killed — 67 soldiers and six civilians. Meanwhile, 2,251 Palestinians were killed, 551 of them children. Those casualty numbers affected the way the world saw the conflict, and the narrative of justified self-defense that the IDF presented wasn’t universally accepted outside Israel, said Dov Waxman, director of the Y&amp;S Nazarian Center for Israel Studies at UCLA.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s really the last decade, during which so many events and shifts and factors have changed thoughts in the public domain,” Waxman said.” Indeed, myriad dynamics — for example, how U.S. social-justice movements drew parallels to the escalating violence of the 2010s and how Donald Trump’s allied stance toward Israel raised eyebrows during his presidency — have gradually moved the needle on how the American public views the Palestinians. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, what happened in 2014 was the first large-scale escalation in the age of widespread social media. In the years since, researchers have pointed to the ways in which social media has reframed how the international community observes war in real time, whether over the past decade with the <a href="https://cepr.org/multimedia/twitter-changes-how-media-reports-conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palestinians</a> or this year with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/world/europe/ukraine-war-social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukrainians</a>. Whereas bumper stickers once spread messages locally, hashtags were now sending information buzzing around the globe. Until then, most wide-scale information, particularly about life in Gaza, came through mainstream media outlets. Now, for the first time, people around the world were exposed and had access to <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-social-media-amplifies-new-voice-in-mideast-conflict/1968253.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firsthand accounts from Palestinians</a>, many of which challenged (or at least contextualized) the details reported by large outlets. Some posts also singled out headlines and language used by such publications, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/01/12/israel-palestine-conflict-news-headlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accusing their framing</a> of the violence as unfairly neglecting the Palestinian struggle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“That summer, it was just so clear, how disproportionate the violence was,” said Ben Daniel. “The Israeli government will often talk about their assaults as ‘it’s a war,’ but it became clear that there was only one side with a military.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Her change in perspective is indicative of how Americans’ opinions on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have shifted, too — with change especially pronounced among younger Americans. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/26/modest-warming-in-u-s-views-on-israel-and-palestinians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center data from March</a>, 61 percent of American adults under 30 have a favorable view of the Palestinian people, compared with 56 percent who have a favorable view of the Israeli people. Ben Daniel thinks it’s important that these young Americans have also been witnessing growing civil rights movements at home.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Younger Americans express warmest views of Palestinians" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RwdWD/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="474" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Around the same time, Black Lives Matter was having a resurgence. And alliances between folks at, say, Ferguson [Missouri] and Palestine shifted consciousness in general,” said Ben Daniel. She believes that the violence in Gaza in 2014 and the support of Black Lives Matter happening in tandem and underpinned by social media helped circulate comparisons to the conflict by paralleling police brutality in the U.S. with IDF tactics in Gaza.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the Black Lives Matter movement, which formed following the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/trayvon-martin-trials-stirred-racial-tensions/story?id=19671013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 2013 acquittal</a> of the neighborhood-watch volunteer who <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-return-jail-bail-revoked-trayvon-martin/story?id=16484963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed Trayvon Martin</a>, has aligned itself with the Palestinian cause. <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-tweet-support-for-ferguson-protesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2014</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/16/black-lives-matter-palestinian-struggle-us-left" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again in 2021</a>, pro-Palestinian activists and Black Lives Matter activists have demonstrated their support for each other on social media.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a growing share of Americans began confronting uncomfortable and embedded injustices in their own country, the parallel details in Palestinian accounts of systematic oppression contextualized a conflict halfway across the world in a new light. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This comparison has been moving. But it has also been controversial. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It can be a starting point for people new to the conflict, but I caution against taking the comparison too far. That’s ignoring a lot of more complicated dynamics and history,” said Laura Birnbaum, the national political director of J Street, a prominent pro-Israel advocacy group that supports a two-state solution. Comparing the BLM and pro-Palestine movements isn’t something everyone will see as fair, Birnbaum said. She and other supporters of Israel don’t think it’s reasonable to analogize Jews in Israel as white, slave-owning colonizers when the Jewish state exists because of the historical oppression of its people. And some still see Israel in a precarious position as the only non-Muslim-majority country in the Middle East, Waxman said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is another place where age may come into play. Whereas some older generations of Americans lived through the latter half of the 20th century, when Israel’s existence was not necessarily considered a guarantee, millennials and Gen Zers are more likely to view Israel as a strong nation with ample financial and military power, Waxman said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the very least, the use of the BLM comparison shows how the framing of this conversation has changed. What was once a debate over the logistics of land division has now, for liberal Democrats, turned to a discussion about Palestinians’ human rights. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Liberal Democrats sympathize most with Palestinians" aria-label="Range Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Vl69Y/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="283" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that, Waxman said, helps explain why the pro-Palestine position has become a facet of progressive and Democratic identity. “In the past, supporting Israel was seen as aligned with or consistent with liberal values. And, increasingly, it’s seen as contradicting liberal beliefs and values,” he said. This shift has happened primarily among the most liberal Democrats. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/390737/americans-pro-israel-though-palestinians-gain-support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> polling from February indicates that liberal Democrats sympathize more with Palestinians compared with Democrats as a whole, by 52 percent to 38 percent. Moderate and conservative members of the party still tend to sympathize more with Israelis. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that is exactly what we’ve seen with a small but growing set of politicians. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/17/clinton-sanders-supporters-differ-sharply-on-u-s-global-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research survey from April 2016</a> showed a widening gap on this issue between supporters of Hillary Clinton and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, the most publicly pro-Palestinian members of Congress — Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who herself is Palestinian American, and Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose hijab renders her visibly Muslim — have also aligned themselves with the party’s progressive left arm. This divide between moderate and liberal Democrats on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is evocative of recurring debates in the direction of the party <a href="https://apnews.com/article/democrats-divided-progressives-centrists-say-trust-gone-a3d66f83ddac9b18e607f46429dbc408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">across a host of issues</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the schism occurring within the Democratic Party over Israel is only further facilitated by how staunchly Republicans have doubled down on their support. Conservatives are more sympathetic toward Israel than ever, and interestingly, evangelical Christians, who skew overwhelmingly Republican, report <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/03/more-white-evangelicals-than-american-jews-say-god-gave-israel-to-the-jewish-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even stronger pro-Israeli beliefs</a> than Jewish Americans according to Pew. Meanwhile, Waxman and Ben Daniel also suggested that Trump’s close allyship with Israel’s then-prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem — a city claimed by both Israel and Palestine — as Israel’s capital only drove the notion of unconditional support for Israel further to the right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Palestine-Israel question has become an increasing variable in politics, determining campaign funding for certain candidates. Earlier this year, in the Democratic primary for North Carolina’s 4th Congressional District, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, helped <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/05/17/aipac-super-pac-funnels-millions-in-dark-money-to-progressive-candidates-in-democratic-races_partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise about $2 million for state Sen. Valerie Foushee</a>, who ran against and ultimately defeated pro-Palestinian and hijabi candidate Nida Allam, a Durham County commissioner. As is usually the case, however, the money in Foushee’s campaign didn’t go toward pro-Israel campaign messaging but instead to closer-to-home everyday issues that resonated with constituents on the ground, like Foushee’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd07H0trD4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-choice abortion stance</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That is indicative of the fact that, while the pendulum is shifting for Democrats, it hasn’t really affected policy yet, Waxman said. That’s because no matter their political identity or age, Americans don’t rate Israel as a high priority issue in their daily lives. “Americans aren’t voting on this, really,” Waxman said. “It’s too far removed compared to other, more everyday issues.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, opinions on the Palestinian cause show that issues don’t have to dictate votes to be relevant within a party. This topic will likely continue to matter for Democrats, even if it doesn’t help get them elected. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Sept. 22, 2022, 7:05 p.m.):</strong> This article and the second chart have been updated with Gallup polling data from Feb. 1-17. They previously cited Gallup polling data from 2021. The second chart has also been updated to clarify that the share of Americans who sympathize more with Palestinians is being subtracted from the share of Americans who sympathize more with Israelis, not Israel itself.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">One <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major storyline</a> coming out of the 2020 election was the rightward shift of Latino voters, who supported former President Donald Trump at a higher rate than they had four years earlier. Although about 3 in 5 Latinos <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for President Joe Biden</a>, this still represented a decline in Democratic support from 2016, when around 2 in 3 backed Hillary Clinton. With November fast approaching, the outcomes in a number of races in the 2022 midterms could hinge on whether Democrats continue to lose ground among Latino voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nowhere is this more true than in Arizona and Nevada, two states with large Latino populations and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly competitive races</a> for U.S. Senate and governor. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exit polls</a> from 2020 and other <a href="https://naleo.org/COMMS/PRA/2022/2022-Arizona-Voter-Profile.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey data</a> suggest <a href="https://naleo.org/COMMS/PRA/2022/Nevada-2022-Profile.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Latinos will make up</a> about 20 percent of the 2022 electorate in both states. It’s important to remember that Latino voters aren’t a single voting bloc, as they have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-no-such-thing-as-the-latino-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diverse views and backgrounds</a>. Still, they will <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help decide control of the Senate</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/election-deniers-office-2024-fivethirtyeight-89613076" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key swing-state governorships</a>, and recent polls provide mixed signals about how blue or red these voters might broadly go.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In early September, Emerson College looked at the Senate and governor races in both states, finding extremely tight races across the board among likely voters. In Arizona, <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/arizona-2022-mark-kelly-faces-tight-race-with-blake-masters-katie-hobbs-and-kari-lake-in-dead-heat-for-governorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson found</a> Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly ahead of Republican Blake Masters by only 2 percentage points, 47 percent to 45 percent, while Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Republican Kari Lake were tied at 46 percent in the governor’s contest. In Nevada, <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/nevada-2022-us-senate--gubernatorial-elections-in-statistical-dead-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pollster’s survey</a>, sponsored by KLAS-TV and The Hill, found Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto trailing former Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt by 1 point, 42 percent to 41 percent, while Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak and Republican Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo were knotted up at 40 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In all races, however, the Democratic nominee led among Latino voters: Kelly held an 11-point edge and Hobbs a 12-point advantage, while Cortez Masto led by 19 points and Sisolak by 16 points. Now, like most surveys, the sample sizes for Latinos in Emerson’s polls weren’t very big, meaning those data points have a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger margin of error</a>. Nevertheless, they do provide some much-needed information about what’s going on among Latino voters in these two key states. And considering the tight overall margins, the data also shows how reduced Democratic support among Latinos could make or break their chances.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Emerson’s findings suggest Democrats are in a worse position among Latinos now than in 2020. Back then, Biden carried 61 percent of Latino voters in both <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a>, according to the 2020 exit polls. <a href="https://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Election-Polling-Resources/Explaining-Exit-Polls.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exit polls are</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/upshot/there-are-more-white-voters-than-people-think-thats-good-news-for-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imperfect measures</a>, but they also found that Kelly won among Latinos 65 percent to 35 percent in his narrow 2020 special election victory. By comparison, Emerson’s poll gave Kelly an advantage among Latinos of 53 percent to 41 percent — a far smaller advantage than he enjoyed in 2020. The Nevada poll gave Democrats a larger lead in terms of margin but also put Cortez Masto and Sisolak’s overall support among Latinos in the mid-40s, with a large share of undecideds. If those undecideds mostly split evenly, the Democrats would perform at a similar level to what the 2020 exit polls found, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/16/polling-isnt-broken-we-too-often-miss-its-hidden-signals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s impossible to say at this point</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You should never take one poll as gospel, and other recent surveys have found Democrats performing somewhat better among Latinos. A <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/AZ-crosstabs_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-August-12-16_released-Aug-18-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mid-August survey</a> of Arizona by Beacon Research/Shaw &amp; Company Research for Fox News found Kelly with an overall lead of 8 points among registered voters, and Hobbs a 3-point lead. Among Latinos, Hobbs led by 9 points — similar to Emerson’s finding — but Kelly held a 20-point advantage, 53 percent to 33 percent. Although the Fox News poll had a higher share of undecided Latino voters than the Emerson survey, Kelly’s lead was not far from the sort of margin Biden enjoyed in 2020 (though still an underperformance relative to Kelly’s own 2020 margin). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Nevada, a mid-August poll from <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/8_22_2022_tables.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University/Reno Gazette-Journal</a> gave Cortez Masto a 7-point lead overall among likely voters, 45 percent to 38 percent, and Sisolak a 3-point advantage, 43 percent to 40 percent. They each led among Latinos, with Cortez Masto leading 48 percent to 30 percent and Sisolak 47 percent to 31 percent. That lead, with a smaller share of undecideds, was comparatively stronger than the Democrats’ leads in Emerson’s survey.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although we don’t have data for Latino voters from every poll of these races, these Democratic candidates’ overall electoral situations are currently at least a little favorable — if far from certain. Kelly holds an 8-point lead in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a>,<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> and the FiveThirtyEight 2022 midterm election forecast <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">views Kelly as a favorite</a>, while Hobbs <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holds a slimmer 3-point advantage</a> in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona’s toss-up governor’s race</a>. In Nevada, Cortez Masto has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-point edge</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sisolak a 2-point lead</a>, and our forecast <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes each</a> of them <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a slight favorite</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the economy remains an opportunity for Republicans to make inroads with Latino voters. In Emerson’s polls of Arizona and Nevada, a sizable plurality of likely voters named the economy as the most important issue for their vote (36 percent in Arizona, 42 percent in Nevada), including a plurality of Latino voters. Among all voters who cited the economy (so not just Latinos), the Republican candidates garnered 62 to 67 percent of the vote. And while it’s a national poll, the survey released <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/politics/latino-vote-polling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a> by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/16/upshot/september-2022-times-siena-poll-crosstabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siena College/New York Times</a> also found that registered Latino voters were split about which party they agreed with more on economic issues.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the second-most-cited issue in Emerson’s Arizona and Nevada polls was abortion access (16 percent in Arizona, 18 percent in Nevada), and voters who identified it as the key issue in determining their vote almost uniformly backed the Democratic candidates. Abortion is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/16/abortion-latino-issues-voters-midterms-00052119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an important issue</a> for Latinos, too, and a <a href="https://www.unidosus.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/unidosus_mifamiliavota_nationalsurveyoflatinovoters_81022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent national poll</a> from BSP Research/UnidosUS/Mi Familia Vota found 59 percent of Latino voters thought Democrats would do a better job addressing abortion, compared with only 11 percent who thought Republicans would.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That tension between economic concerns and abortion rights may be especially pivotal for Latino voters because a large number of them are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-latinos-really-moved-toward-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persuadable voters</a>. That’s because many <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912919888577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack strong ties to the two major political parties</a>, often because they are first-generation Americans or had first-generation parents who weren’t as politically engaged and <a href="https://www.robertofcarlos.com/uploads/6/9/4/3/69439129/late_to_the_party_on_the_prolonged_partisan_socialization_process_of_secondgeneration_americans.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t pass along their partisan views</a>. In a 2020 postmortem, Latino-focused Equis Research found that approval for Trump’s economic policies <a href="https://equisresearch.medium.com/2020-post-mortem-part-one-16221adbd2f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was a pivotal reason</a> for Republican gains among Latino voters. But it’s possible that the headwinds of abortion politics could hinder Republicans from building on that improvement, as 61 percent of Latino respondents told Siena College/New York Times that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So while the polling in Arizona and Nevada suggests Democrats could be in a weaker position in 2022 among Latinos than they were in 2020, abortion <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does seem to have fired up</a> the Democratic base and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-is-becoming-a-winning-issue-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially turned off</a> some persuadable voters — many of whom are Latinos — from the GOP. We anxiously await more polling to get a better idea of just how Latino voters are trending in Arizona, Nevada and elsewhere.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">When people of color see politicians who look like them, it can have profound effects. <a href="https://wappp.hks.harvard.edu/files/wappp/files/should_blacks_represent_blacks_and_women_represent_women_a_contingent_yes1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political science research</a> suggests that this so-called “descriptive representation” increases Americans’ <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust in politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25749258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engagement with politics</a>. But in the U.S., the percentage of people of color running for office lags far behind their share of the population (<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">41 percent</a>). And it’s not enough for nonwhite candidates to simply run; to achieve any sort of proportional representation, obviously, they also have to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2022, 30 percent of the candidates who ran in Democratic or Republican primaries for Senate, House or governor were people of color, according to new data collected throughout the primary season by political scientists <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/fraga-bernard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernard Fraga</a> and <a href="https://hunterrendleman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hunter Rendleman</a>.<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using statements made by candidates, membership in racial and ethnic caucuses or organizations, racial and ethnic advocacy organizations, news articles and candidate websites. This research is, by nature, not comprehensive — for example, Fraga and Rendleman were unable to confirm some candidates’ racial identities — but the data is close enough to identify important trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a> And the data shows that only 28 percent of the candidates appearing on the November ballot will be people of color. In other words, in all likelihood, 2023 will not be the year that people of color are proportionally represented in the halls of government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unsurprisingly, as has been the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/18/democratic-party-was-more-racially-diverse-1996-than-republican-party-is-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case for decades</a>, Democrats had a more diverse candidate pool. At least 46 percent of their candidates this cycle were people of color, as opposed to only 19 percent of Republican candidates. But, in 2022 — possibly because white candidates were more likely to have advantages like incumbency and fundraising, possibly because of racism on the part of voters, possibly for other reasons — candidates of color from both parties had a harder time winning their primaries. As a result, when we mapped Fraga and Rendleman’s data onto the primary results, we found that people of color will constitute just 39 percent of Democratic general-election candidates and 16 percent of Republican general-election candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, several distinct racial groups are included in those numbers, and some are better represented than others. Here is the full breakdown by race for all candidates who ran in this year’s primaries:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Black candidates make up a majority of candidates of color in both charts. According to Fraga and Rendleman, 16 percent of all Democratic and Republican candidates for Senate, House and governor this cycle were Black. In comparison, 15 percent of the final nominees for those offices identified as Black. That’s slightly higher than their share of the U.S. population, which is 14 percent. But of course, one party had a lot more Black candidates than the other: 28 percent of Democratic candidates running in primaries identified as Black, but only 8 percent of Republican candidates did. And while at least 111 Black Democrats are on the November ballot, there are only 31 self-identified Black Republicans. Still, Black Republican members of Congress have been so rare in the past 150 years that there’s a good chance that the 118th Congress will have a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-black-republicans-make-a-comeback-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record number</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The researchers found that Hispanic and Latino Americans are the second-most-common minority group in 2022’s candidate pool, making up 8 percent of all candidates and 9 percent of the final nominees. But both numbers are much smaller than their share of the population (19 percent, though they constitute a smaller share of the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/cvap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citizen voting-age population</a>). Hispanics and Latinos are also more evenly split between the parties: 53 Democrats and 31 Republicans are running in the general election. That mirrors the fact that, while Latinos still <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22436307/catalist-equis-2020-latino-vote-trump-biden-florida-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lean Democratic overall</a>, they are much more of a swing demographic than Black voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also interesting patterns among 2022’s Latino candidates. At least 26 Latino Democrats on the November ballot identified as being of Mexican descent, and at least five as Puerto Rican. But Fraga and Rendleman could identify only two who are Cuban American. By contrast, they found Republicans have nominated at least seven Cuban Americans. Fraga and Rendleman could find only 10 Mexican American Republican nominees and no Puerto Rican ones. This jibes with data that shows <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-no-such-thing-as-the-latino-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuban Americans are a Republican-leaning group</a>, but Puerto Ricans and especially Mexican Americans are generally Democratic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Asian Americans are also underrepresented, constituting 6 percent of the U.S. population but only 4 percent of total candidates and 3 percent of nominees. Once again, the researchers found that Democratic nominees who are Asian American outnumber Republican nominees who are Asian American, 18 to 13. There is evidence that some Asian American voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/20/us/politics/election-hispanics-asians-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted toward Republicans in 2020</a>, but they remain Democratic-leaning overall. There are also significant differences in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-asian-americans-are-thinking-about-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how various Asian American groups vote</a>. For example, Indian Americans are predominantly Democratic, while Vietnamese Americans lean Republican. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that a plurality of Democrats’ Asian American nominees were found to be of Indian descent (at least seven), while a plurality of Republicans’ were of Vietnamese descent (at least three).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Members of other racial and ethnic groups could also make history this November. At least eight nominees are Native American: five Democrats and three Republicans. Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, became Congress’s first-ever Alaska Native when she was <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/09/13/mary-peltola-makes-history-as-first-alaska-native-person-sworn-into-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sworn in last week</a>. And if Republican Rep. Markwayne Mullin wins his Senate race in Oklahoma, he would be the Senate’s only Native American member. Each party also nominated at least three candidates of Middle Eastern descent, including Republican Mehmet Oz, who would be the <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-08-27/mehmet-oz-senate-first-muslim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Muslim in the U.S. Senate</a>. Finally, Fraga and Rendleman found that Republicans nominated two Native Hawaiians (both in Hawaii itself). Democrats, meanwhile, nominated none. And given Hawaii’s blue hue, it is quite likely that Native Hawaiians will again go unrepresented in Congress following the retirement of Rep. Kai Kahele.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, these candidates still have to overcome one final hurdle before they really live up to the hopes of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/abs/what-is-a-descriptive-representative/93AF3B26486FFE76B201FBA07E35D1C9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">descriptive representation</a>: They need to win in November. For many of them, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that will be a challenge</a>, as they are running as Republicans in deeply Democratic districts or vice versa. Ultimately, that means that the final number of people of color sitting in Congress or governor’s offices at this time next year will be even smaller than the numbers here. </p>]]></description>
