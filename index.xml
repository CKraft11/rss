<p data-paragraph="main">If the U.S. Supreme Court really does overturn Roe v. Wade, abortion would effectively become illegal in 13 states — and heavily restricted in many others — because of trigger laws designed to go into effect either immediately or within weeks. Each of these laws is a little different, but all of them make some kind of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/us/abortion-trigger-laws.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exception for the health or life of the mother.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But determining when someone’s health or life is at risk is not always straightforward. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Medical science doesn’t come with tidy boundaries between life and death, emergency and non-emergency. Sometimes it’s not clear if an emergency is life-threatening until it’s too late. Other times, a medical problem could mean losing years of one’s life or struggling with long-term health problems but not necessarily dying today or tomorrow. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’re looking for patients, clinicians and hospital administrators who have had to navigate these kinds of situations. We’re especially interested in talking to people who have had to ask a hospital board to approve an abortion in this kind of case, or who have been on the boards considering such cases. We want to understand how biology and medicine leave patients and the people who care for them in gray areas that can’t be easily legislated. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Political division <a href="https://legacy.voteview.com/political_polarization_2015.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been on the rise</a> for years in the U.S. The gap between the two parties <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/solutions-to-political-polarization-in-america/confronting-asymmetric-polarization/3966003B2517E22BF288796AC4985F34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only grown more sharply</a> in Congress, while the share of Americans who interact with people from the other party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-and-republicans-should-argue-more-not-less/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has plummeted</a>. Furthermore, many Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/03/04/about-one-fifth-of-democrats-and-republicans-get-political-news-in-a-kind-of-media-bubble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only read news or get information</a> from sources that align with their political beliefs, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-partisans-look-at-the-same-evidence-on-ukraine-and-see-wildly-different-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exacerbates fundamental disagreements</a> about the basic facts of many political problems.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, hatred — specifically, hatred of the other party — increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defines our politics</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to overstate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how dire the situation is</a> because it’s been this way for a while. It’s something, too, that everyday Americans are feeling — and are worried about. “American citizens are growing more extreme and isolated in their political views,” said a white woman in her mid-30s from Wisconsin who identified as a Democrat. “No one can respect each other’s opinions and try to work together in a peaceful way,” said a Republican Hispanic man from California in his mid-20s. “Individuals and the media hard-sell their own views with no understanding or attempted understanding of other viewpoints,” said an independent Black woman from Texas in her mid-60s.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polarization and extremism ranked third across a list of 20 issues that we asked about in the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a>, which was conducted from May 26 to June 6. Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we interviewed the same 2,000 or so Americans from our previous survey, and of the 1,691 adults who responded, 28 percent named “political extremism or polarization” as one of the most important issues facing the country,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As was the case in the first wave of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. Sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.9 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> trailing only “inflation or increasing costs” and “crime or gun violence,” the latter of which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/over-40-percent-of-americans-now-rate-gun-violence-as-a-top-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surged in the aftermath</a> of mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans are pretty concerned with political polarization" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cnADC/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="607" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Americans typically have not ranked polarization or extremism as a top concern. Historically, concerns around the economy or fear of military conflict have loomed the largest in American minds. But over the past decade, Gallup has seen a larger share of people cite <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/165302/dysfunctional-gov-surpasses-economy-top-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction with the government or poor leadership</a> as the nation’s top issue, reaching <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246800/record-high-name-government-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record highs</a> in recent years. This is similar to what we found in our survey, too. Almost 3 in 10 Americans said they were worried about extremism and polarization, which is essentially unchanged from our poll last month.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats were the most likely to name polarization or extremism as a top worry, at 33 percent, but independents and Republicans weren’t too far behind at 28 percent and 23 percent, respectively. This does seem, though, to be an issue that Americans who are more politically engaged care about. For instance, 38 percent of likely voters named it as a top concern, compared with 28 percent overall, which marked the largest gap between likely voters and Americans as a whole on any issue we measured.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How Americans define “polarization” varies. Some spoke of the inability of the two major parties to compromise, while others blamed political leaders or the other party. But overall, regardless of how they identified politically, most Americans blamed elites for America’s divides. Sixty-four percent said they felt political polarization is mostly driven by political and social elites, compared with only 11 percent who thought it had more to do with how ordinary Americans think and behave.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 25 percent said they didn’t know or skipped the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> “Both political parties have moved way to the outside, and there's no center pole for people to meet at,” said Sandra O’Kay, an elderly woman from Virginia who identified as an independent. “Congress is not making the rules. They're just fighting one another.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And when we asked about what specific groups or ideas might be driving polarization, there was also a fair amount of consensus on the four leading contributors: politicians, wealthy donors, social media companies and mainstream media outlets. After that, though, agreement broke down, and there were some stark differences across party lines. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans blame politicians and the media for stoking divisions" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2pDYG/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="481" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The biggest splits by party came over the role of conservative media outlets, religion and religious leaders. Nearly two-thirds of Americans thought conservative media had a “major” or “significant” impact on political division. However, as you can see in the chart above, this was strongly split along party lines. Eighty-one percent of Democrats said this, compared with only 48 percent of Republicans, while independents echoed where Americans fell overall. Democrats were also more likely to say that religion or religious leaders were major drivers of polarization, which probably reflects the fact that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/pp_2020-06-02_party-id_2-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are much more likely to be religiously unaffiliated</a> than Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were also smaller but still noticeable splits over the role racism, capitalism and wealth inequality play in stoking division. For instance, solid majorities of both Democrats and Republicans said that they felt that racism had had a major or significant impact on polarization, with 82 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of Republicans answering that way. However, given that Republicans and Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-still-a-huge-partisan-gap-in-how-americans-see-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view discrimination very differently</a>, they likely answered this way for very different reasons. Meanwhile, Democrats were likelier to blame wealth inequality and capitalism than were Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of this disagreement on what’s driving polarization likely reflects just how far apart the two parties are on a variety of issues; however, even where there are stark disagreements, those differences are often still overstated. We asked respondents in our survey whether they agreed with five statements that we thought were polarizing, and to guess how members of the other party would respond. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the topic of whether abortion should be legal in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, a majority of Democrats and Republicans were on the same side — about 89 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans agreed with this statement. However, their <em>perceptions</em> of each other were starkly different: Democrats thought that a minority (only 30 percent) of Republicans agreed, whereas Republicans correctly thought that a solid majority (68 percent, which is still an underestimate) of Democrats agreed with the statement.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans hold some misperceptions about one another" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qQR4v/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="679" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That said, there were other instances where Democrats and Republicans knew just how divided they were on an issue. For instance, on the topic of what should be taught in middle and high schools, 64 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans said that schools should teach about sexual orientation and gender identity. And respondents from both parties guessed within 2 percentage points of the actual share of the other party that agreed with the statement. We saw a somewhat similar picture regarding whether middle and high schools should teach race and racism in the U.S. Eighty-three percent of Democrats said they should, while Republicans perceived Democratic support at 65 percent; meanwhile, just 29 percent of Republicans agreed, while Democrats thought 19 percent of Republicans were in support.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The disconnect between Democrats and Republicans over race and racism is further exemplified by their vastly different responses to Republican South Carolina Sen. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/29/992063405/president-biden-gops-tim-scott-offer-diverging-views-of-race-in-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Scott’s</a> statement, “America is not a racist country. It's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present.” In our survey, we asked respondents to score eight public statements on whether they represented an extreme or non-extreme viewpoint,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We defined “extreme” as responses that said the statement was “very” or “somewhat” extreme, and “not extreme” as responses that rated the statement as “not very” or “not at all” extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> and when they were asked to rate Scott’s anonymized quote as “extreme” or “not extreme,” almost three in four Democrats said that it was extreme, as opposed to just 34 percent of Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These partisan differences are in part related to the ethnic diversity of Democrats, as Black and Hispanic Americans account for a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/pp_2020-06-02_party-id_2-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger portion of the Democratic Party</a> than the Republican Party. Tellingly, respondents’ answers also varied by race or ethnicity, with nearly three-quarters of Black Americans and 57 percent of Hispanic Americans finding the statement extreme, compared to 48 percent of white Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Suffice it to say, there are <em>real</em> differences between the two parties, but most Americans (62 percent) still want the U.S. to actively reduce political polarization. Only 9 percent think that the U.S. should let things be.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 percent said that they didn’t know or skipped the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> But as our poll shows time and time again, many Americans don’t think political leaders and elites represent their interests. “I feel like I have to just kind of read up on what people are saying and what people are doing and try to figure out who's the least extreme, who I side with. [To make the U.S. less polarized,] I think [we need] cooperation and collaboration between everybody, politicians and people in general,” said Sara from Alabama. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s evident, too, that polarization is weighing heavily on many Americans, as it’s hard to see a way out of our current partisan gridlock. “I think things have to hit such a dark, grizzly, rock-bottom state,” said Randal Strauss, a 55-year old independent man from Nebraska. “Where people think, hey, something's got to change.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This week’s primaries are a gamble — and not just because many of them are in Nevada. Former President Donald Trump is backing challengers to not one but two incumbent members of Congress, which will once again put the power of his endorsement to the test. Meanwhile, both parties face decisions about how far right or left of center a nominee can be in a swing seat and still stand a chance of winning in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, four states are holding primaries on Tuesday: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina. We aren’t expecting any races in Maine or North Dakota to be competitive, but to make up for it, there’s a special election in Texas that either party could plausibly win. So grab your lucky dice and let’s roll through the important elections this week.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st and 7th congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plenty of Republicans — like South Carolina’s own senators, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott — have walked the line between criticizing and praising Trump and have managed to stay on his good side, but Rep. Nancy Mace, of South Carolina’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong>, has not. Despite working for his 2016 presidential campaign early in the primary season, Mace <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/newsmaker-scs-nancy-mace-speaks-out-about-jan-6-and-her-former-boss-donald-trump/article_0134c7f8-61ce-11ec-8f9a-c317e9d5151b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripped Trump a new one</a> after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, saying that the insurrection had “wiped out” “[e]very accomplishment that Republicans have made over the last four years.” However, she quickly tried to mend those fences with votes against a bipartisan Jan. 6 commission and for ousting anti-Trump Rep. Liz Cheney from House Republican leadership.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump didn’t buy it. In February, he <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-49ynqegxvm1542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> former state Rep. Katie Arrington — a loyalist who shares his false belief that the <a href="https://www.wltx.com/article/news/local/vote/mace-arrington-meet-in-south-carolina-1st-district-unitedstates-house-representative-debate-politics/101-29a0132a-8f28-4804-a2e5-86456ea8d9e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a> — in the Republican primary against Mace. Notably, too, Arrington has experience taking down incumbents in this coastal, Charleston-area seat: She <a href="https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/politics/elections/state/2018/06/13/trump-backer-arrington-defeats-sanford-in-primary/11985379007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford</a> in the 2018 Republican primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mace looks like a tougher foe, however. First, she outraised Arrington by a whopping <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0SC01394/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.1 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2SC01150/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$909,447</a>, as of May 25. Second, Mace isn’t as anti-Trump as Sanford, who briefly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/12/mark-sanford-presidential-bid-trump-069872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran against Trump</a> for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination; she didn’t vote to impeach Trump, for instance. She’s also <a href="https://m.facebook.com/nancyrmace/videos/im-standing-in-front-of-trump-tower-with-a-message-this-morningsc01-lowcountryfi/1054561101770084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that Arrington (who lost the general election in 2018) would lose the seat to Democrats in the fall, though redistricting made the 1st District safely Republican (it has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> of R+17), so that isn’t an honest argument. The primary could go either way: The only non-internal poll of the race, conducted May 26-29 by the <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SC01-GOP-Primary-Poll-Report-0601.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group</a>, gave Mace 46 percent and Arrington 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door in the <strong>7th District</strong>, though, another anti-Trump Republican looks like he’s in more trouble. Rep. Tom Rice was one of the more anonymous members of the House GOP caucus before Jan. 13, 2021, when he shockingly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-elections-impeachments-south-carolina-7278bdc701aaa2d74d1f46c97a6233e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to impeach Trump</a> for his role in the Jan. 6 riot. (The vote came so far out of left field that some observers initially thought it was an error.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Six other Republicans, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/454411952597146/permalink/697460194958986/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all</a> <a href="https://www.spencermorrisforcongress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of</a> <a href="https://barbaraarthurforcongress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">them</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/GarrettBartonSC/status/1473815874561667075?s=20&amp;t=BrkMwQl3bZd9Mabp7BE0jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ardent</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMcBrideUS/status/1409976933601927170?s=20&amp;t=BrkMwQl3bZd9Mabp7BE0jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article259273459.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defenders</a>, filed to run against Rice, and initially the field was <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1504097178700165123?s=20&amp;t=GA4y7JlS1eh2Ch6Jjg-Wxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite muddled</a> — Rice wasn’t polling great, but neither was anyone else. But in February, Trump tapped state Rep. Russell Fry as <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/myrtle-beach/politics/donald-trump-endorses-russell-fry-in-primary-challenge-to-sc-congressman-tom-rice/article_863bba62-8387-11ec-ab26-63ae4d94c45d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his preferred candidate</a>, and Fry shot up in the polls. According to another <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SC07-GOP-Primary-Poll-Report-0601.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group poll</a>, also conducted May 26-29, Fry entered the home stretch with 42 percent support to Rice’s 25 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With other candidates like self-funder Ken Richardson still earning a decent share of the vote, however, it looks very possible that no one will win a majority on Tuesday. If that happens, the top two finishers — likely to be Fry and Rice — will head to a runoff on June 28. But given the size of the anti-incumbent vote, Rice is probably cooked either way.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch: </strong>34th Congressional District </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas’s primaries <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/texas-election-biden-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were on March 1</a> with its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/11-primaries-to-watch-in-alabama-arkansas-minnesota-and-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runoff elections</a> on May 24, but there’s one more election on our radar in the Lone Star State before this November’s general election: the special election in the <strong>34th District</strong> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/24/filemon-vela-resign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the resignation</a> of Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The winner of Tuesday’s special election will finish Vela’s truncated term, which ends in January. But Republicans in the state are eager to go ahead and flip the 34th District as they attempt to make inroads in South Texas — along with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several other border-area seats</a> in the fall. Republican gains in the 34th might be short-lived, though, because while Tuesday’s election will happen under the previous, more competitive boundaries of the 34th District — which has a partisan lean of D+5 — the November election, which will decide who succeeds Vela for a full term in Congress, will be held under new district boundaries that are much more favorable to Democrats — its boundaries have a partisan lean of D+17. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the Republican side, the biggest name in the four-person field is Mayra Flores, the current GOP nominee for the seat in the November general election. Not only does Flores have the backing of Texas Gov. <a href="https://www.gregabbott.com/governor-greg-abbott-endorses-mayra-flores-for-congressional-district-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Abbott</a>, but she also has the support of the <a href="https://congressionalleadershipfund.org/trailblazers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Leadership Fund</a>, a super PAC close to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. There haven’t been many public polls of the race, but a new <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5u8kf9ryfiwrb7i/RRH%20Elections%20TX-34%20Poll%20Release.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RRH Elections/Poll Project USA</a> poll gave Flores a 9-point edge over her nearest opponent, former Cameron County Commissioner Dan Sanchez, a Democrat. According to the survey, Flores led among likely or completed voters with 43 percent support, while Sanchez netted 34 percent. Another internal party poll conducted in late April by <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TX-CD-34_Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnar Research Partners for Flores</a> and the National Republican Congressional Committee similarly gave Flores an edge over Sanchez, 24 percent support to 19 percent. In that survey, Democrat Rene Coronado, a civil service director, came in third, at 9 percent, while Republican Juana Cantu-Cabrera, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-34.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Flores’s opponents</a> in the March primary, earned 7 percent. Forty-one percent of voters, however, were still undecided. And as far as outside spending goes, Flores has an edge here, too. She and <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1534518699805261825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her allies</a> have <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1529849232521322503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poured hundreds of thousands</a> of dollars and resources into TV ads, and as of May 25, Flores significantly outraised Sanchez. Sanchez does, though, have a little bit more cash on hand (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00811901/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$104,017</a>) than Flores (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00768994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100,387</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a historically Democratic seat. Vela <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/V000132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represented the district since 2013</a>, and Democratic presidential candidates handily beat Republicans in the district in <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/3/23/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-statewide-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012 and 2016</a>. And in 2020, President Biden still won the district by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 percentage points</a>. But the Republican offensive has caught Democrats off guard in an area of the state <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/04/joe-biden-texas-border-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they have long dominated</a>. Part of the struggle for Democrats here is that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee didn’t get involved in the race <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1533090469504245761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until recently</a>, when it launched a $100,000 ad buy in partnership with Sanchez’s campaign. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It seems as if Democrats’ strategy has been to avoid investing heavily in this race and instead wait until the fall. It’s also worth noting that Sanchez <em>isn’t</em> running to fill Vela’s full term; instead, it’s Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez — who opted to not run in Tuesday’s special election — who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-34.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sailed through the March 1 primary</a> and will be the party’s nominee against Flores this fall. So, even if Sanchez were to<em> </em>win, he’d hold the seat only until January. National Democrats, meanwhile, have maintained that Gonzalez will easily triumph in November, especially since that race will take place under district lines that are more favorable to Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, though, another possible wrinkle in Tuesday’s race is that the special election could<em> </em>go to a runoff given the presence of Coronado and Cantu-Cabrera, two lesser-known candidates, on the ballot; if no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the top two vote-getters go head-to-head later this year. Still, Sanchez <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/06/republicans-south-texas-special-election-tx-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has expressed confidence</a> that his party can win the seat outright.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most vulnerable politicians in the country this year, and eight Republicans are running for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> in hopes of replacing her. The front-runner is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who boasts endorsements from both <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/donald-trump-endorses-ex-nevada-ag-adam-laxalt-for-senate-2424479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> and the <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/elections/pac-endorsed-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Club for Growth</a>, an anti-government-spending outside group that has a lot of influence in Republican primaries. Laxalt was a co-chair of Trump’s 2020 campaign in Nevada and <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2021/11/08/adam-laxalt-trumpism-and-the-big-lie-a-chronology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a lawsuit</a> two days after the election, falsely alleging that thousands of improper votes had been cast in Nevada. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Army veteran Sam Brown has run a <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/05/10/republican-candidate-sam-brown-nevada-senate-race-primary-election-2022/7374118001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunningly effective grassroots campaign</a> that has contrasted his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/outsider-nevadas-gop-senate-primary-surges-rattling-trumps-pick-rcna31225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsider status</a> with Laxalt’s establishment roots. (Laxalt is the grandson of former Nevada Gov. and Sen. Paul Laxalt.) Brown has also somehow tried to position himself as even Trumpier than Laxalt, too, arguing that Laxalt was <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/09/in-an-odd-early-morning-debate-brown-says-laxalts-efforts-to-save-trump-were-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not aggressive <em>enough</em></a> in trying to stop alleged voter fraud. As of May 25, Brown has raised more than $2 million from small donors and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2NV00308/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $4 million</a> in total, which he has used to outspend Laxalt on TV and radio ads through June 1. A <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-laxalt-has-a-14-point-lead-over-brown-in-week-before-election-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 6-7 poll</a> from OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent still gave Laxalt a 48 percent to 34 percent lead among likely voters, but that represented a tightening of the race since <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-cortez-masto-leads-laxalt-in-senate-race-but-biden-disapproval-foreboding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even more Republicans — 15! — are vying for the right to take on Democratic incumbent Steve Sisolak in the race for <strong>governor</strong>. When former Sen. Dean Heller <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/dean-heller-launches-bid-for-governor-attempts-political-comeback-three-years-after-senate-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the race</a> last year, he <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/independent-poll-sisolak-cortez-masto-hold-slim-leads-over-likely-gop-opponents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked like the favorite</a> based on his political experience (he didn’t lose a single election from 1990 until 2018) and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/dean-heller-running-governor-nevada-refuses-say-joe-biden-won-n1279869" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born-again Trumpism</a>. But Heller <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sisolak-raises-record-4-5-million-in-2021-has-more-cash-than-all-gop-foes-combined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with fundraising</a> and <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/05/gop-ex-u-s-senator-dean-heller-lags-race-nevada-governor/7403033001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to make voters forget his moderate past</a>. By January 2022, a new front-runner <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-sisolak-leads-governor-candidates-lombardo-tops-gop-field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had emerged</a>: Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ironically, Lombardo is not as Trumpist as Heller on issues like <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/immigration-proves-to-be-flashpoint-between-lombardo-other-gop-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and the <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/01/southern-nevada-sheriff-looks-north-first-bid-governors-office/7818738002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election</a> (when asked if it was fair, he said he didn’t have enough information to say), but Trump <a href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/2022/04/28/trump-endorses-joe-lombardo-governor-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him anyway</a> in late April, after it became clear he was leading. Despite that vote of confidence, however, Lombardo doesn’t seem to be running away with the nomination. The aforementioned <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-lombardo-maintains-gop-governor-primary-lead-lg-and-sos-races-remain-close" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights/Nevada Independent poll</a> gave him just 34 percent, little changed from January. But instead of Heller (who took just 10 percent), his closest competitor was Trump true believer Joey Gilbert, an attorney and former professional boxer who <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/01/06/gubernatorial-hopeful-joey-gilbert-no-regrets-about-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a>. Gilbert received 21 percent support in the poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans also face a choice of whom to nominate in Nevada’s three competitive, Democratic-held U.S. House seats. Thanks to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>, that list now includes the <strong>1st District</strong>, which went from a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+22 to just D+4 in an attempt to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/democrats-gamble-with-their-nevada-gerrymander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shore up the other Democratic seats</a>. Eight Republicans are <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/jun/10/scrum-of-challengers-jockey-to-face-titus-in-nevad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting for the nomination</a>, and without any public polls of the primary, it’s hard to say who’s favored. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One strong contender could be Carolina Serrano, who led the Trump campaign’s Hispanic outreach efforts in Las Vegas in 2020. In addition to her campaign experience, Serrano has raised the most money as of May 25 (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV04094/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$568,123</a>) and has Laxalt’s endorsement. But Army veteran Mark Robertson has raised nearly as much (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV03153/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$542,621</a>) and has the backing of diehard Arizona conservative Rep. Andy Biggs. Pro-Israel activist David Brog has also raised a respectable <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV01298/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$381,728</a>, and former Rep. Cresent Hardy could draw support from those looking for an experienced hand (though he has somehow raised just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NV04059/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9,000</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whoever wins will face Democratic Rep. Dina Titus in November … probably. Titus <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/titus-facing-hardest-race-in-recent-years-to-retain-seat-in-newly-competitive-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces a challenge in the Democratic primary</a> from progressive activist Amy Vilela, who has been endorsed by <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/bernie-sanders-endorses-vilela-in-house-primary-against-incumbent-titus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>. It’s rare, of course, for an incumbent to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose in a primary</a>, but there are a couple reasons to think this could be a sleeper race. First, because of how drastically Nevada’s congressional map was redrawn, only 52 percent of people in the new 1st District are Titus’s current constituents, meaning she may not get the full benefits of incumbency. Also, despite getting outraised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NV03036/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV01264/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$490,568</a>, Vilela has actually spent more money than Titus ($437,195 to $329,210) as of May 25, suggesting Titus may not be taking the challenge seriously. (That said, it’s possible that Titus has spent a lot more since then.) If Vilela does pull off an upset, though, it could make it more challenging for Democrats to hold this newly competitive seat in the current, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning</a> political environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans also have their eye on defeating Democratic Rep. Susie Lee in the <strong>3rd District</strong>, with its partisan lean of only D+2. Attorney April Becker looks like the <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/09/attorney-leads-in-fundraising-endorsements-in-cd3-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cream of a five-candidate crop</a>: She has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV03161/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> and has a ton of institutional support from the <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidates/april-becker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Republican Congressional Committee</a>, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Nevada Republican Party. Groups that aim to elect more Republican women to Congress, such as <a href="http://maggieslist.org/candidates/2022-candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie’s List</a> and Rep. Elise Stefanik’s <a href="https://elevate-pac.com/our-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-PAC</a>, are also <a href="https://viewpac.org/who-we-support/#NEVADA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing her</a> to <a href="https://winningforwomen.com/2022-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the hilt</a>. However, two men — engineer John Kovacs and Army veteran Noah Malgeri — have also raised a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NV/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respectable sum of money</a> for their campaigns and can’t be counted out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, three candidates are <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/trio-of-republicans-target-horsford-in-4th-district-2577111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking the Republican nomination</a> to take on Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford in the <strong>4th District</strong>, which is now Nevada’s bluest House seat, at D+5. Assemblywoman Annie Black is probably Democrats’ dream opponent; she has <a href="https://anniefornevada.com/anniegrams/the-real-big-lie-is-that-biden-won-fair-and-square/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vociferously argued</a> that the 2020 election was stolen, and she <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2021/jan/09/democratic-group-wants-nevada-lawmaker-who-cheered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a> outside the Capitol (but also condemned those who actually broke into the building). However, she has raised only about half as much money as Air Force veteran Sam Peters, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV04128/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$360,755</a> versus <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NV04023/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$716,382</a>, respectively. Peters, though, is no moderate; he has said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/us/politics/republican-election-fraud-claims.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have voted to certify</a> the results of the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Republican <strong>Secretary of State</strong> Barbara Cegavske term-limited, Nevadans will also elect a new top election official this year — an extremely important post given Nevada’s status as a key swing state. And most of the candidates in the Republican primary are at least sympathetic to — if not fully convinced by — Trump’s false belief that the <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/jun/09/gop-secretary-of-state-candidates-largely-cling-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That includes the two front-runners, former Assemblyman Jim Marchant and former state Sen. Jesse Haw, who were tied for first place in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CTiQCmW_nxI108fJ9qg6VzVm_pGvctHi/edit#gid=1338850840" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> of the race. However, Marchant has been much more assertive about his antidemocratic convictions. After losing a congressional race in 2020, Marchant <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-rejects-marchant-request-for-new-election-in-congressional-race-over-voter-fraud-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued for a rerun of the election</a>, claiming he was a victim of fraud. “Your vote hasn’t counted for decades,” he <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-debates-secretary-of-state-candidates-cast-wildly-different-visions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told voters at a February debate</a>. “You haven’t elected anybody. The people that are in office have been selected. You haven’t had a choice.” Marchant says he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/candidates-say-trump-won-2020now-running-oversee-future-elections-rcna26241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have certified the 2020 election</a> in Nevada if he had been secretary of state at the time, and he wants to ban the use of electronic voting machines, mail voting and early voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Haw, who has been blanketing the state with <a href="https://twitter.com/haw_jesse/status/1519346263031894016?s=20&amp;t=rGq0l2QaQq7Cm2tfa-sbYQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV ads</a> thanks to his significant financial advantage over his opponents, has been more evasive. He <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/elections-and-big-lie-come-to-the-fore-in-secretary-of-state-primaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Nevada Independent</a> that the 2020 election “had a lot of shenanigans and potential fraud” but has focused mostly on besmirching Nevada’s liberal election laws, such as a new regulation allowing non-family members to return other people’s absentee ballots.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://dc.medill.northwestern.edu/blog/2022/05/24/nevada-sos-race/#sthash.92Cx5p68.cSjmsZ6M.dpbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only Republican</a> who has publicly acknowledged that President Biden legitimately won the election is Sparks City Councilman Kristopher Dahir, but he took only 3 percent in the poll. The winner of the GOP primary will face attorney Cisco Aguilar, the only Democrat in the running, in November.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, two Republicans are also running in hopes of unseating Democratic <strong>Attorney General</strong> Aaron Ford, the state’s chief law-enforcement officer. Former Nevada Cannabis Association President Tisha Black’s campaign is being run by consultants with <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-primary-for-nevadas-top-cop-pits-establishment-backed-lawyer-against-conservative-firebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ties to the Republican establishment</a>, but she faces a spirited challenge from conservative activist Sigal Chattah. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Chattah says she decided to run for attorney general because of her belief that Nevada’s COVID-19 restrictions were unconstitutional, and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwwGGjk2XUs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provocative rhetoric</a> on and off the campaign trail has sometimes gotten her in trouble. (Most notably, a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/ag-candidate-in-feud-with-former-ally-says-text-not-racist-leaked-to-damage-her-2528181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text message was leaked</a> in which she said Ford, who is Black, “should be hanging from a [expletive] crane.”) She also says she wants to <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/20/chattah-black-spar-in-republican-ag-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prosecute women who have abortions</a>, though she has acknowledged that abortion is legally protected in Nevada and that she is obligated to uphold the law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Black and Chattah have also pledged to use the power of their office to prosecute voter fraud, which they believe is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/state-ag-races-litmus-test-gop-election-claims-82706738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more common than it really is</a>. (“Our democracy, I believe, is in question,” Black told the <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-primary-for-nevadas-top-cop-pits-establishment-backed-lawyer-against-conservative-firebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada Independent</a>.) The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1i21SmRkaavn80r1vqV89tVJcUY5JdO/edit#gid=1473190800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only poll of the primary</a>, conducted back in early May by OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent, found a toss-up race, with the two candidates virtually tied and a plurality of voters undecided.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This week’s primaries are a gamble — and not just because many of them are in Nevada. Former President Donald Trump is backing challengers to not one but two incumbent members of Congress, which will once again put the power of his endorsement to the test. Meanwhile, both parties face decisions about how far right or left of center a nominee can be in a swing seat and still stand a chance of winning in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, four states are holding primaries on Tuesday: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina. We aren’t expecting any races in Maine or North Dakota to be competitive, but to make up for it, there’s a special election in Texas that either party could plausibly win. So grab your lucky dice and let’s roll through the important elections this week.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1239146693-711.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1239146693-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1239146693-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1239146693-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Former state Rep. Katie Arrington is one of two primary challengers in South Carolina who has former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. <p>Sean Rayford / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>South Carolina</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st and 7th congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plenty of Republicans — like South Carolina’s own senators, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott — have walked the line between criticizing and praising Trump and have managed to stay on his good side, but Rep. Nancy Mace, of South Carolina’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong>, has not. Despite working for his 2016 presidential campaign early in the primary season, Mace <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/newsmaker-scs-nancy-mace-speaks-out-about-jan-6-and-her-former-boss-donald-trump/article_0134c7f8-61ce-11ec-8f9a-c317e9d5151b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripped Trump a new one</a> after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, saying that the insurrection had “wiped out” “[e]very accomplishment that Republicans have made over the last four years.” However, she quickly tried to mend those fences with votes against a bipartisan Jan. 6 commission and for ousting anti-Trump Rep. Liz Cheney from House Republican leadership.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump didn’t buy it. In February, he <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-49ynqegxvm1542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> former state Rep. Katie Arrington — a loyalist who shares his false belief that the <a href="https://www.wltx.com/article/news/local/vote/mace-arrington-meet-in-south-carolina-1st-district-unitedstates-house-representative-debate-politics/101-29a0132a-8f28-4804-a2e5-86456ea8d9e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a> — in the Republican primary against Mace. Notably, too, Arrington has experience taking down incumbents in this coastal, Charleston-area seat: She <a href="https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/politics/elections/state/2018/06/13/trump-backer-arrington-defeats-sanford-in-primary/11985379007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford</a> in the 2018 Republican primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mace looks like a tougher foe, however. First, she outraised Arrington by a whopping <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0SC01394/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.1 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2SC01150/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$909,447</a>, as of May 25. Second, Mace isn’t as anti-Trump as Sanford, who briefly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/12/mark-sanford-presidential-bid-trump-069872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran against Trump</a> for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination; she didn’t vote to impeach Trump, for instance. She’s also <a href="https://m.facebook.com/nancyrmace/videos/im-standing-in-front-of-trump-tower-with-a-message-this-morningsc01-lowcountryfi/1054561101770084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that Arrington (who lost the general election in 2018) would lose the seat to Democrats in the fall, though redistricting made the 1st District safely Republican (it has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> of R+17), so that isn’t an honest argument. The primary could go either way: The only non-internal poll of the race, conducted May 26-29 by the <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SC01-GOP-Primary-Poll-Report-0601.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group</a>, gave Mace 46 percent and Arrington 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door in the <strong>7th District</strong>, though, another anti-Trump Republican looks like he’s in more trouble. Rep. Tom Rice was one of the more anonymous members of the House GOP caucus before Jan. 13, 2021, when he shockingly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-elections-impeachments-south-carolina-7278bdc701aaa2d74d1f46c97a6233e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to impeach Trump</a> for his role in the Jan. 6 riot. (The vote came so far out of left field that some observers initially thought it was an error.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Six other Republicans, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/454411952597146/permalink/697460194958986/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all</a> <a href="https://www.spencermorrisforcongress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of</a> <a href="https://barbaraarthurforcongress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">them</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/GarrettBartonSC/status/1473815874561667075?s=20&amp;t=BrkMwQl3bZd9Mabp7BE0jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ardent</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMcBrideUS/status/1409976933601927170?s=20&amp;t=BrkMwQl3bZd9Mabp7BE0jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article259273459.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defenders</a>, filed to run against Rice, and initially the field was <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1504097178700165123?s=20&amp;t=GA4y7JlS1eh2Ch6Jjg-Wxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite muddled</a> — Rice wasn’t polling great, but neither was anyone else. But in February, Trump tapped state Rep. Russell Fry as <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/myrtle-beach/politics/donald-trump-endorses-russell-fry-in-primary-challenge-to-sc-congressman-tom-rice/article_863bba62-8387-11ec-ab26-63ae4d94c45d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his preferred candidate</a>, and Fry shot up in the polls. According to another <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SC07-GOP-Primary-Poll-Report-0601.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group poll</a>, also conducted May 26-29, Fry entered the home stretch with 42 percent support to Rice’s 25 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With other candidates like self-funder Ken Richardson still earning a decent share of the vote, however, it looks very possible that no one will win a majority on Tuesday. If that happens, the top two finishers — likely to be Fry and Rice — will head to a runoff on June 28. But given the size of the anti-incumbent vote, Rice is probably cooked either way.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch: </strong>34th Congressional District </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas’s primaries <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/texas-election-biden-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were on March 1</a> with its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/11-primaries-to-watch-in-alabama-arkansas-minnesota-and-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runoff elections</a> on May 24, but there’s one more election on our radar in the Lone Star State before this November’s general election: the special election in the <strong>34th District</strong> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/24/filemon-vela-resign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the resignation</a> of Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The winner of Tuesday’s special election will finish Vela’s truncated term, which ends in January. But Republicans in the state are eager to go ahead and flip the 34th District as they attempt to make inroads in South Texas — along with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several other border-area seats</a> in the fall. Republican gains in the 34th might be short-lived, though, because while Tuesday’s election will happen under the previous, more competitive boundaries of the 34th District — which has a partisan lean of D+5 — the November election, which will decide who succeeds Vela for a full term in Congress, will be held under new district boundaries that are much more favorable to Democrats — its boundaries have a partisan lean of D+17. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the Republican side, the biggest name in the four-person field is Mayra Flores, the current GOP nominee for the seat in the November general election. Not only does Flores have the backing of Texas Gov. <a href="https://www.gregabbott.com/governor-greg-abbott-endorses-mayra-flores-for-congressional-district-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Abbott</a>, but she also has the support of the <a href="https://congressionalleadershipfund.org/trailblazers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Leadership Fund</a>, a super PAC close to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. There haven’t been many public polls of the race, but a new <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5u8kf9ryfiwrb7i/RRH%20Elections%20TX-34%20Poll%20Release.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RRH Elections/Poll Project USA</a> poll gave Flores a 9-point edge over her nearest opponent, former Cameron County Commissioner Dan Sanchez, a Democrat. According to the survey, Flores led among likely or completed voters with 43 percent support, while Sanchez netted 34 percent. Another internal party poll conducted in late April by <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TX-CD-34_Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnar Research Partners for Flores</a> and the National Republican Congressional Committee similarly gave Flores an edge over Sanchez, 24 percent support to 19 percent. In that survey, Democrat Rene Coronado, a civil service director, came in third, at 9 percent, while Republican Juana Cantu-Cabrera, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-34.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Flores’s opponents</a> in the March primary, earned 7 percent. Forty-one percent of voters, however, were still undecided. And as far as outside spending goes, Flores has an edge here, too. She and <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1534518699805261825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her allies</a> have <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1529849232521322503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poured hundreds of thousands</a> of dollars and resources into TV ads, and as of May 25, Flores significantly outraised Sanchez. Sanchez does, though, have a little bit more cash on hand (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00811901/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$104,017</a>) than Flores (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00768994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100,387</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a historically Democratic seat. Vela <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/V000132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represented the district since 2013</a>, and Democratic presidential candidates handily beat Republicans in the district in <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/3/23/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-statewide-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012 and 2016</a>. And in 2020, President Biden still won the district by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 percentage points</a>. But the Republican offensive has caught Democrats off guard in an area of the state <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/04/joe-biden-texas-border-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they have long dominated</a>. Part of the struggle for Democrats here is that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee didn’t get involved in the race <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1533090469504245761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until recently</a>, when it launched a $100,000 ad buy in partnership with Sanchez’s campaign. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It seems as if Democrats’ strategy has been to avoid investing heavily in this race and instead wait until the fall. It’s also worth noting that Sanchez <em>isn’t</em> running to fill Vela’s full term; instead, it’s Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez — who opted to not run in Tuesday’s special election — who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-34.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sailed through the March 1 primary</a> and will be the party’s nominee against Flores this fall. So, even if Sanchez were to<em> </em>win, he’d hold the seat only until January. National Democrats, meanwhile, have maintained that Gonzalez will easily triumph in November, especially since that race will take place under district lines that are more favorable to Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, though, another possible wrinkle in Tuesday’s race is that the special election could<em> </em>go to a runoff given the presence of Coronado and Cantu-Cabrera, two lesser-known candidates, on the ballot; if no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the top two vote-getters go head-to-head later this year. Still, Sanchez <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/06/republicans-south-texas-special-election-tx-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has expressed confidence</a> that his party can win the seat outright.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 1st, 3rd and 4th congressional districts; governor; attorney general; secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most vulnerable politicians in the country this year, and eight Republicans are running for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> in hopes of replacing her. The front-runner is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who boasts endorsements from both <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/donald-trump-endorses-ex-nevada-ag-adam-laxalt-for-senate-2424479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> and the <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/elections/pac-endorsed-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Club for Growth</a>, an anti-government-spending outside group that has a lot of influence in Republican primaries. Laxalt was a co-chair of Trump’s 2020 campaign in Nevada and <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2021/11/08/adam-laxalt-trumpism-and-the-big-lie-a-chronology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a lawsuit</a> two days after the election, falsely alleging that thousands of improper votes had been cast in Nevada. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Army veteran Sam Brown has run a <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/05/10/republican-candidate-sam-brown-nevada-senate-race-primary-election-2022/7374118001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunningly effective grassroots campaign</a> that has contrasted his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/outsider-nevadas-gop-senate-primary-surges-rattling-trumps-pick-rcna31225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsider status</a> with Laxalt’s establishment roots. (Laxalt is the grandson of former Nevada Gov. and Sen. Paul Laxalt.) Brown has also somehow tried to position himself as even Trumpier than Laxalt, too, arguing that Laxalt was <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/09/in-an-odd-early-morning-debate-brown-says-laxalts-efforts-to-save-trump-were-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not aggressive <em>enough</em></a> in trying to stop alleged voter fraud. As of May 25, Brown has raised more than $2 million from small donors and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2NV00308/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $4 million</a> in total, which he has used to outspend Laxalt on TV and radio ads through June 1. A <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-laxalt-has-a-14-point-lead-over-brown-in-week-before-election-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 6-7 poll</a> from OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent still gave Laxalt a 48 percent to 34 percent lead among likely voters, but that represented a tightening of the race since <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-cortez-masto-leads-laxalt-in-senate-race-but-biden-disapproval-foreboding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even more Republicans — 15! — are vying for the right to take on Democratic incumbent Steve Sisolak in the race for <strong>governor</strong>. When former Sen. Dean Heller <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/dean-heller-launches-bid-for-governor-attempts-political-comeback-three-years-after-senate-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the race</a> last year, he <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/independent-poll-sisolak-cortez-masto-hold-slim-leads-over-likely-gop-opponents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked like the favorite</a> based on his political experience (he didn’t lose a single election from 1990 until 2018) and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/dean-heller-running-governor-nevada-refuses-say-joe-biden-won-n1279869" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born-again Trumpism</a>. But Heller <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sisolak-raises-record-4-5-million-in-2021-has-more-cash-than-all-gop-foes-combined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with fundraising</a> and <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/05/gop-ex-u-s-senator-dean-heller-lags-race-nevada-governor/7403033001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to make voters forget his moderate past</a>. By January 2022, a new front-runner <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-sisolak-leads-governor-candidates-lombardo-tops-gop-field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had emerged</a>: Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ironically, Lombardo is not as Trumpist as Heller on issues like <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/immigration-proves-to-be-flashpoint-between-lombardo-other-gop-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and the <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/01/southern-nevada-sheriff-looks-north-first-bid-governors-office/7818738002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election</a> (when asked if it was fair, he said he didn’t have enough information to say), but Trump <a href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/2022/04/28/trump-endorses-joe-lombardo-governor-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him anyway</a> in late April, after it became clear he was leading. Despite that vote of confidence, however, Lombardo doesn’t seem to be running away with the nomination. The aforementioned <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-lombardo-maintains-gop-governor-primary-lead-lg-and-sos-races-remain-close" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights/Nevada Independent poll</a> gave him just 34 percent, little changed from January. But instead of Heller (who took just 10 percent), his closest competitor was Trump true believer Joey Gilbert, an attorney and former professional boxer who <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/01/06/gubernatorial-hopeful-joey-gilbert-no-regrets-about-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a>. Gilbert received 21 percent support in the poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans also face a choice of whom to nominate in Nevada’s three competitive, Democratic-held U.S. House seats. Thanks to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>, that list now includes the <strong>1st District</strong>, which went from a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+22 to just D+4 in an attempt to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/democrats-gamble-with-their-nevada-gerrymander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shore up the other Democratic seats</a>. Eight Republicans are <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/jun/10/scrum-of-challengers-jockey-to-face-titus-in-nevad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting for the nomination</a>, and without any public polls of the primary, it’s hard to say who’s favored. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One strong contender could be Carolina Serrano, who led the Trump campaign’s Hispanic outreach efforts in Las Vegas in 2020. In addition to her campaign experience, Serrano has raised the most money as of May 25 (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV04094/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$568,123</a>) and has Laxalt’s endorsement. But Army veteran Mark Robertson has raised nearly as much (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV03153/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$542,621</a>) and has the backing of diehard Arizona conservative Rep. Andy Biggs. Pro-Israel activist David Brog has also raised a respectable <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV01298/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$381,728</a>, and former Rep. Cresent Hardy could draw support from those looking for an experienced hand (though he has somehow raised just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NV04059/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9,000</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whoever wins will face Democratic Rep. Dina Titus in November … probably. Titus <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/titus-facing-hardest-race-in-recent-years-to-retain-seat-in-newly-competitive-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces a challenge in the Democratic primary</a> from progressive activist Amy Vilela, who has been endorsed by <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/bernie-sanders-endorses-vilela-in-house-primary-against-incumbent-titus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>. It’s rare, of course, for an incumbent to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose in a primary</a>, but there are a couple reasons to think this could be a sleeper race. First, because of how drastically Nevada’s congressional map was redrawn, only 52 percent of people in the new 1st District are Titus’s current constituents, meaning she may not get the full benefits of incumbency. Also, despite getting outraised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NV03036/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV01264/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$490,568</a>, Vilela has actually spent more money than Titus ($437,195 to $329,210) as of May 25, suggesting Titus may not be taking the challenge seriously. (That said, it’s possible that Titus has spent a lot more since then.) If Vilela does pull off an upset, though, it could make it more challenging for Democrats to hold this newly competitive seat in the current, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning</a> political environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans also have their eye on defeating Democratic Rep. Susie Lee in the <strong>3rd District</strong>, with its partisan lean of only D+2. Attorney April Becker looks like the <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/09/attorney-leads-in-fundraising-endorsements-in-cd3-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cream of a five-candidate crop</a>: She has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV03161/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> and has a ton of institutional support from the <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidates/april-becker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Republican Congressional Committee</a>, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Nevada Republican Party. Groups that aim to elect more Republican women to Congress, such as <a href="http://maggieslist.org/candidates/2022-candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie’s List</a> and Rep. Elise Stefanik’s <a href="https://elevate-pac.com/our-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-PAC</a>, are also <a href="https://viewpac.org/who-we-support/#NEVADA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing her</a> to <a href="https://winningforwomen.com/2022-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the hilt</a>. However, two men — engineer John Kovacs and Army veteran Noah Malgeri — have also raised a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NV/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respectable sum of money</a> for their campaigns and can’t be counted out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, three candidates are <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/trio-of-republicans-target-horsford-in-4th-district-2577111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking the Republican nomination</a> to take on Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford in the <strong>4th District</strong>, which is now Nevada’s bluest House seat, at D+5. Assemblywoman Annie Black is probably Democrats’ dream opponent; she has <a href="https://anniefornevada.com/anniegrams/the-real-big-lie-is-that-biden-won-fair-and-square/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vociferously argued</a> that the 2020 election was stolen, and she <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2021/jan/09/democratic-group-wants-nevada-lawmaker-who-cheered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a> outside the Capitol (but also condemned those who actually broke into the building). However, she has raised only about half as much money as Air Force veteran Sam Peters, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV04128/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$360,755</a> versus <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NV04023/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$716,382</a>, respectively. Peters, though, is no moderate; he has said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/us/politics/republican-election-fraud-claims.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have voted to certify</a> the results of the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Republican <strong>Secretary of State</strong> Barbara Cegavske term-limited, Nevadans will also elect a new top election official this year — an extremely important post given Nevada’s status as a key swing state. And most of the candidates in the Republican primary are at least sympathetic to — if not fully convinced by — Trump’s false belief that the <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/jun/09/gop-secretary-of-state-candidates-largely-cling-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That includes the two front-runners, former Assemblyman Jim Marchant and former state Sen. Jesse Haw, who were tied for first place in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CTiQCmW_nxI108fJ9qg6VzVm_pGvctHi/edit#gid=1338850840" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> of the race. However, Marchant has been much more assertive about his antidemocratic convictions. After losing a congressional race in 2020, Marchant <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-rejects-marchant-request-for-new-election-in-congressional-race-over-voter-fraud-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued for a rerun of the election</a>, claiming he was a victim of fraud. “Your vote hasn’t counted for decades,” he <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-debates-secretary-of-state-candidates-cast-wildly-different-visions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told voters at a February debate</a>. “You haven’t elected anybody. The people that are in office have been selected. You haven’t had a choice.” Marchant says he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/candidates-say-trump-won-2020now-running-oversee-future-elections-rcna26241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have certified the 2020 election</a> in Nevada if he had been secretary of state at the time, and he wants to ban the use of electronic voting machines, mail voting and early voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Haw, who has been blanketing the state with <a href="https://twitter.com/haw_jesse/status/1519346263031894016?s=20&amp;t=rGq0l2QaQq7Cm2tfa-sbYQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV ads</a> thanks to his significant financial advantage over his opponents, has been more evasive. He <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/elections-and-big-lie-come-to-the-fore-in-secretary-of-state-primaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Nevada Independent</a> that the 2020 election “had a lot of shenanigans and potential fraud” but has focused mostly on besmirching Nevada’s liberal election laws, such as a new regulation allowing non-family members to return other people’s absentee ballots.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://dc.medill.northwestern.edu/blog/2022/05/24/nevada-sos-race/#sthash.92Cx5p68.cSjmsZ6M.dpbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only Republican</a> who has publicly acknowledged that President Biden legitimately won the election is Sparks City Councilman Kristopher Dahir, but he took only 3 percent in the poll. The winner of the GOP primary will face attorney Cisco Aguilar, the only Democrat in the running, in November.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, two Republicans are also running in hopes of unseating Democratic <strong>Attorney General</strong> Aaron Ford, the state’s chief law-enforcement officer. Former Nevada Cannabis Association President Tisha Black’s campaign is being run by consultants with <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-primary-for-nevadas-top-cop-pits-establishment-backed-lawyer-against-conservative-firebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ties to the Republican establishment</a>, but she faces a spirited challenge from conservative activist Sigal Chattah. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Chattah says she decided to run for attorney general because of her belief that Nevada’s COVID-19 restrictions were unconstitutional, and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwwGGjk2XUs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provocative rhetoric</a> on and off the campaign trail has sometimes gotten her in trouble. (Most notably, a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/ag-candidate-in-feud-with-former-ally-says-text-not-racist-leaked-to-damage-her-2528181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text message was leaked</a> in which she said Ford, who is Black, “should be hanging from a [expletive] crane.”) She also says she wants to <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/20/chattah-black-spar-in-republican-ag-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prosecute women who have abortions</a>, though she has acknowledged that abortion is legally protected in Nevada and that she is obligated to uphold the law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Black and Chattah have also pledged to use the power of their office to prosecute voter fraud, which they believe is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/state-ag-races-litmus-test-gop-election-claims-82706738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more common than it really is</a>. (“Our democracy, I believe, is in question,” Black told the <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-primary-for-nevadas-top-cop-pits-establishment-backed-lawyer-against-conservative-firebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada Independent</a>.) The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1i21SmRkaavn80r1vqV89tVJcUY5JdO/edit#gid=1473190800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only poll of the primary</a>, conducted back in early May by OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent, found a toss-up race, with the two candidates virtually tied and a plurality of voters undecided.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Sunday, 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans in the Senate announced that they had reached an agreement on new gun-safety measures and funding for mental-health services and school security. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew explains how senators made this bipartisan deal and considers whether this unwritten gun-control legislation could be passed by the end of the year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The team also discusses Alaska’s special primary election to replace its longtime U.S. representative, Don Young, who died in March. Former Gov. Sarah Palin is leading so far, but results won’t be certified for about two more weeks, until all the mail-in ballots have been processed and counted. And on Tuesday, four states — Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina — are holding their primary elections, but only Nevada and South Carolina have competitive races; the most interesting race to watch on Tuesday, though, is another special election in Texas, where candidates are vying to succeed Rep. Filemon Vela for the rest of his term in the 34th Congressional District, after he resigned in April. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, FiveThirtyEight’s Kaleigh Rogers and Galen Druke talk about the ongoing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-january-6-committee-hosted-a-hearing-for-the-21st-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House select committee hearings</a> investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and how the messaging is developing through both emotional testimony and raw footage from the day of the insurrection.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">If the conservative Supreme Court justices were hoping that eliminating abortion protections would make Americans think the country was on their side, they might not be as persuasive as they hope. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/3574x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new preprint</a> from Chelsey Clark and Elizabeth Levy Paluck, researchers at Princeton University, shows that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recent leak</a> of a draft Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade made some Americans more likely to think others <em>wanted</em> abortion protections. Perhaps as a result, these Americans also saw the justices as more out of step with mainstream public opinion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clark and Paluck conducted a panel survey of U.S. residents (one that returns to the same group of participants over time) between June 2020 and May 2022, and their study found that the share of panel participants who think that <em>other</em> Americans support legal abortion spiked after the draft opinion became public.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one question in this study, participants were asked, “To what extent do you believe that people in America disagree or agree that a woman should continue to be able to have an abortion legally?” and were allowed to respond “strongly agree,” “agree,” “somewhat agree,” “neutral,” “somewhat disagree,” “disagree” or “strongly disagree.” For the purpose of our analysis, we combined “strongly agree” and “agree” and omitted the share of participants who answered “neutral.” The study’s original sample comprised 3,013 participants, and by the final survey, the study had retained 1,149 of the participants. Though the sample was unweighted, its demographic makeup remained similar between the first survey and the final survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> Notably, the sample for this survey is not representative of the general U.S. population: Participants tended to be more liberal, younger, whiter and less religious than the American public as a whole. So, while the findings can’t be extrapolated to everyone in the country, several political scientists who did not conduct the research but reviewed the findings told us that the survey’s results are nevertheless an intriguing signal of how some Americans — particularly people on the left — might be responding to the leak.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Panelists likelier to say others support abortion rights after leak" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mxvD5/21/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="634" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">After the leak, self-identified conservatives were also more likely to say that other people supported legal abortion, although the effect was smaller than among self-identified liberals. In other words, the news that the Supreme Court appears poised to overturn Roe may have made a higher share of panel participants think that Americans want to <em>keep</em> those protections, regardless of what they personally think about abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the survey, personal attitudes toward the legality and morality of abortion shifted little in response to the leak. But Clark and Paluck believe that media coverage of the leak may have jolted some Americans — particularly liberals — into realizing that support for abortion rights is more widespread than they’d thought. “The leak comes out, and then there are all these headlines about outrage, about how this is going against the majority opinion of Americans,” Clark, a doctoral student in social psychology who is leading the study, told me. “That actually appears to be changing how some people are thinking about the social environment around them — what other people find to be acceptable.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s worth reiterating: Paluck and Clark’s sample is unweighted, and therefore, it isn’t representative of the country as a whole. That being said, the findings do point to how liberals in particular might be thinking about the issue. “It’s likely that [the study’s participants] do reflect a large proportion of Americans — we just can’t say with certainty that they do,” said <a href="https://govt.dartmouth.edu/people/sean-jeremy-westwood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean Westwood</a>, a professor of government at Dartmouth College who reviewed the study’s findings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The strength of the study is its ability to return to the same participants again and again and to see what does — and doesn’t — change their minds. And the leak did have an impact on some of those participants. “I think what we’re seeing here is an epiphany of sorts,” said <a href="https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/donald-p-green" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald P. Green</a>, a professor of political science at Columbia University who also reviewed the study’s findings. “You see the liberal public, especially, being increasingly alarmed at the prospect of an activist, conservative court. It’s like they’re poker players who have just seen someone lay down their hand.” This lines up, too, with other recent polling suggesting that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are more likely</a> to identify as “pro-choice” than they were before the leak.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The study also picked up a shift in panel participants’ view of the Supreme Court more broadly. The share of participants who believe the Supreme Court is conservative also rose after the leak. Unlike the shift in perceptions of the extent to which other Americans support legal abortion, though, this change had been building for a while. The shift seems to have accelerated between a survey from August 2020 and one from November 2021.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two months represent the sixth and seventh surveys in the study. The researchers did not conduct a survey for this study in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> And it was likely affected by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal, being <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-amy-coney-barrett-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative</a>, giving the court’s right wing an even stronger, six-justice majority.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Panelists say the Supreme Court is growing more conservative" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XDnVe/15/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="640" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Those results are especially noteworthy given the findings of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2120284119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another recent study</a> from a group of scholars who have tracked public opinion of the court’s decisions over more than a decade. The court’s opinions have taken a sharp right turn in recent years, but not everyone realized that was happening. “​​Democrats are kind of bad at understanding how conservative the court is,” said <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/msen/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maya Sen</a>, a professor at Harvard University and one of the co-authors of the paper. But it makes sense, she added, that the leak would have changed that, at least for some people. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Sen, people tend to widely recognize only two Supreme Court cases — Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade. “So boom, we have the news that the court is going to overturn this quite popular, very widely known precedent,” she said. Clark and Paluck’s findings make a lot of sense in that context. “There’s a huge spotlight that’s all of a sudden being shined on a court that’s been operating under the radar, and showing this is actually a really conservative court,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The leaked opinion, of course, was just a draft. At some point in the next few weeks, the actual ruling will come out, and it could look different. But Clark said that if the court does overturn Roe, outrage would could easily continue to grow. After all, such a ruling would lead to more media coverage as well as more discussion of how the court’s decision <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-americans-stand-on-abortion-in-5-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t reflect where most Americans stand</a> on abortion. Even if people’s individual views don’t change much, the perception that the court's action is out of step with public opinion could embolden people on the left to protest and talk to their neighbors about the issue — which could, in turn, reinforce the perception that the court’s action is far more conservative than many Americans want.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And ultimately, that could be dangerous for the Supreme Court. In the past, the justices <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-can-stop-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have generally hewed to public opinion</a>, in part because there’s always the possibility that they could be reined in by the other branches of government. Right now, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/is-it-time-to-expand-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the risk to the court looks pretty low</a> since few congressional Democrats seem interested in adding more justices to the court — which is their main option for responding. But the findings from Clark and Paluck’s study, as well as from the study co-authored by Sen, suggest that court reform could get more popular. Clark and Paluck found that, after the leak of the Dobbs draft, the liberal participants in their panel survey were more in favor of reducing the court’s power to decide certain types of controversial issues, and Sen and her co-authors similarly found that Democrats who were more aware of how conservative the court really is were more in favor of measures to curb its power. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether that will translate into action by politicians is, of course, much harder to predict. But these findings suggest that overturning Roe isn’t a risk-free proposition for the justices — in fact, a backlash could already be brewing.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The carnage was impossible to deny. As the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol laid out its evidence that former President Donald Trump was the catalyst of the assault on American democracy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3_O91gyj9o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 12-minute video</a> showed the full consequences of Trump’s willful lie that the election was stolen. It was perhaps the committee’s most compelling argument. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The video — which included images recorded by participants in the attack, security footage, news footage, audio recordings from police radio communication and police body-camera recordings — tracked the evolution of the violence on that day, from an agitated crowd gathering at the outskirts of the Capitol, through the bloody, forceful invasion of the building. Much of the footage was raw and played at length; the violence was visceral. In one clip, a first-person view from a fallen U.S. Capitol Police officer’s body camera, you can see the mob bearing down, beating the officer mercilessly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can watch as many clips of Jan. 6 participants calmly strolling through the rotunda as you like, but the footage shared during the hearing make it inarguable that this was no “normal tourist visit,” as GOP <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/18/clyde-tourist-capitol-riot-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Andrew Clyde claimed</a> four months after the attack. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Past <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-host-a-congressional-hearing-that-actually-like-does-something/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockbuster congressional hearings</a> have had blockbuster testimony — and this hearing had that too. But what made Thursday night’s opener of the committee’s series of hearings different was the frequent and effective use of media to bolster the narrative the committee presented.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The task before the committee is significant. In a country so polarized that it cannot agree on what took place during a historic event we all witnessed collectively in real time, the facts matter. The committee is challenged to lay out those facts for a clear accounting of what happened that day, the democratic threat it represented, and the president’s role in provoking it. This is not to prosecute those involved (that’s the job of the Department of Justice) but to protect against further erosion of democracy. Because without a common understanding of just how insidious the attack on Jan. 6 was, it could easily happen again, and the country risks sliding toward authoritarianism. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether the public will accept that accounting is a greater challenge, but one the committee is attempting to meet, in part, by emphasizing the bipartisan work being done. Rep. Liz Cheney, one of just two Republicans on the committee, led the majority of the first hearing, a clear attempt to highlight that this was not a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/us/politics/jan-6-hearings-tv-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political sham witch hunt</a>,” as GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik has claimed. The committee is also attempting to limit partisan grandstanding, instead moving through the process in a methodical, calm manner while allowing testimony and video footage to speak for itself, according to Dannagal Young, a communications professor at the University of Delaware.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Politics is performance. It always has been,” she said. “But that doesn’t change the content of the investigation. It doesn’t change what happened on that day.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Videos — some previously released, others being aired for the first time — were carefully sprinkled throughout the hearing, punctuating information shared by Cheney and committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson. Even in his opening remarks, Thompson included video to underscore the fact that the 2020 election was not stolen from Trump, signaling how big a role media would play in the hearings to come. Warning that the clip contained “strong language,” Thompson paused his remarks to play a clip from former Trump Attorney General Bill Barr’s testimony to the committee, where Barr said he remembers at least three discussions with the president where “I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the president was bullshit.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Later, clips of testimony from Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, another senior White House adviser, demonstrated that those closest to the former president were aware that his claims of fraud were baseless. Video testimony of defendants charged for their alleged involvement in the attack saying that they were in Washington, D.C., that day because Trump had summoned them underscored the president’s role in inspiring the attack. Footage of Caroline Edwards, a U.S. Capitol Police officer on the front lines that day, being knocked unconscious after the mob plowed past a barricade toward her punctuated her live testimony on how violent Jan. 6 was. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Politically speaking, hearing people like Bill Barr and Ivanka Trump say that they knew that there was no fraud and that the election wasn’t stolen is quite powerful because these are people who are very much in Donald Trump’s inner circle admitting that they knew the election was not stolen,” said Steven Webster, a professor of political science at Indiana University Bloomington. “When you have people that close to the president, even his own children, saying there’s no fraud here, that’s a very powerful image.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For those who have kept a close eye on the news, there was little revelatory in this first hearing. But even for those of us who consume this news religiously, the asynchronous discovery of each new piece of information can make it difficult to keep the timeline and details straight. That’s why the methodological retelling in the calm, bureaucratic setting of a congressional hearing is still valuable, even without any bombshell revelations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Prior to the start of the hearing, majority committee member Rep. Adam Schiff told FiveThirtyEight the committee was planning to “present the evidence we have gathered through both live testimony and a variety of media, so as to be both highly engaging and deeply informative.” That media — video, audio and social media posts — was the committee’s preferred tool to try to overcome its many challenges in creating a consensus understanding of Jan. 6, 2021. In a country as polarized as the U.S., where trust of the opposite party is so low, the committee is hoping that seeing with our own eyes and hearing with our own ears will make the truth undeniable. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (June 12, 2022, 11:35 a.m.):</strong> With <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22SPECPRIM/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">108,981 ballots</a> counted so far, Sarah Palin (30 percent), Nick Begich (19 percent) and Al Gross (13 percent) are the top vote-getters so far in Alaska’s special U.S. House election. Mary Peltola currently leads for the fourth and final slot in the August general election with 8 percent, followed closely by Tara Sweeney with 5 percent. Additional batches of results are expected to be released on June 15, June 17 and June 21.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">A groundbreaking new election structure. The 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee. Santa Claus. What <em>doesn’t</em> the special election for Alaska’s U.S. House seat have?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Well, a winner. This Saturday is technically <a href="https://elections.alaska.gov/specialelections.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election day</a> for the first round of the special election, which is being held to replace legendary former Rep. Don Young, the longest-serving Republican in House history who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/obituaries/don-young-obituary-alaska.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed away on March 18</a>. But because the election is being conducted predominantly by mail and ballots don’t need to be received until June 21, we won’t know which candidates have advanced to the second round until later in the month. And, of course, we won’t know who actually wins the seat until after the general election date of <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2022/03/22/alaska-special-election-to-fill-don-young-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aug. 16</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the primary is plenty interesting on its own. First of all, it will winnow a field of <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/candidatelistspecprim.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">48 candidates</a>(!) down to four. Why four and not two? Because following the passage of an <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/11/17/alaska-becomes-second-state-to-approve-ranked-choice-voting-as-ballot-measure-2-passes-by-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election-reform ballot measure</a> in 2020, Alaska now uses a unique top-four primary system whereby all candidates (regardless of party) run on the same ballot and the top four finishers advance to the general election. (In a further twist, the general election will also use <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maine-is-trying-out-a-new-way-to-run-elections-but-will-it-survive-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are three front-runners who seem likely to make the cut. The first is a familiar name to not only Alaskans, but also most Americans: former Gov. Sarah Palin. It feels like a lifetime ago, but Palin was <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2008/sep/03/john-mccain/she-wins-popularity-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most popular governors in the country</a> when she was chosen as former Sen. John McCain’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election. But her rising star blinked out shortly after that: She came to be seen nationally as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2008/10/06/post-debate-palin-still-seen-as-unqualified-a-bump-for-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unqualified</a> for office, and in 2009 (after losing the vice presidency) she unexpectedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/us/politics/04palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned the governorship</a> (apparently because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/us/06palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethics investigations into her</a> were taking a financial and mental toll). For the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/sarah-palin-seriously-interested-in-2016-bid-114548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next several years</a>, there was <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/article/sarah-palins-arizona/2011/05/25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation</a> that she would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/07/sarah-palin-tea-party-speech1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run for office</a> again, but she never did — until this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These days, though, Palin is not popular in Alaska — according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148655178928128?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 6-9 poll</a> from Alaska Survey Research, 59 percent of likely special-election voters had a negative opinion of her, while just 36 percent had a positive one. But she still has a small, devoted fan base that gave her 19 percent of the primary vote in <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148572958035968?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that same poll</a>, more than any other candidate. And that fan base includes one very important non-Alaskan: former President Donald Trump, who has <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/04/04/trump-endorses-palin-in-bid-for-alaskas-sole-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed her</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, a Republican with more room to grow might be businessman Nick Begich III. In contrast with Palin — who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2016/01/13/a-peek-inside-sarah-palins-arizona-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought a house in Arizona</a> after her governorship — Begich’s Alaska ties are rock-solid: His grandfather was former Rep. Nick Begich Sr., whose <a href="https://www.planeandpilotmag.com/news/pilot-talk/2020/09/21/1972-cessna-310c-alaska-disappearance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disappearance in 1972</a> triggered the <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2019/03/06/don-young-46-years-in-an-office-he-never-expected-to-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special election</a> that brought Young to Congress. (The elder Begich was actually a Democrat, but the younger one says he’s a “<a href="https://www.alaskansfornickbegich.com/meet-nick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifelong Republican</a>.”) Begich has also raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK01083/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> (including $650,000 in self-funding) to Palin’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK00226/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$631,690</a>, and he enjoys the Alaska Republican Party’s <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/04/22/alaska-gop-endorse-begich-for-us-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement</a>. He snagged 16 percent in that Alaska Survey Research poll, too, which was good for second place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The third front-runner is fisherman-physician Al Gross, who is the only other candidate who has raised more than a quarter of a million dollars (he’s raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK01166/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$545,745</a>) and the only other candidate who registered in the double digits in the Alaska Survey Research poll (13 percent). Gross is a contender, in part, because he still has plenty of name recognition left over from his 2020 campaign for U.S. Senate, which could help him attract support from liberal (or at least not-conservative) Alaskans; though he is an independent, he ran in 2020 as the Democratic nominee.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Alaska’s old primary system, candidates could still run for — and win — a party’s nomination without being a member of that party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> However, this time around, Gross is <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/05/05/in-a-special-us-house-race-alaska-democrats-wonder-if-now-is-their-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the door open</a> to caucusing with either party if he wins, which has led to a <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/05/09/alaska-democrats-lash-out-at-us-house-candidate-al-gross-the-same-candidate-they-endorsed-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messy breakup</a> with the state’s actual Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That leaves a free-for-all for the fourth and final slot in the August general election. Financially, the best-positioned is former Assistant Secretary of the Interior Tara Sweeney, who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK01174/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$231,364</a> and has also benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/special-elections-outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=AK01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$434,652</a> in super PAC spending. Sweeney, who would be the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress, has <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2022/05/31/alaska-native-candidates-for-us-house-talk-land-into-trust-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pitched herself</a> as “a Ted Stevens and Don Young Republican” in reference to two long-serving former legislators who were more focused on constituent services and appropriations than conservative dogma.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Or — and I can’t believe this is actual, serious political analysis — name recognition could propel Santa Claus into the general election. Claus (<a href="https://www.santaclausforalaska.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a real person</a>) is a city councilor in North Pole (<a href="https://www.northpolealaska.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a real city</a>) and is essentially the Sen. Bernie Sanders of this race — a self-described “independent, progressive, democratic socialist.” Though he’s not accepting campaign contributions, 59 percent of likely voters could form an opinion of him in the Alaska Survey Research poll, more than any other candidate other than Palin, Begich and Gross. It was enough for him to place fourth in that poll, albeit within the margin of error.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also several candidates with more traditional resumes and points in their favor. Republican John Coghill, for instance, still has 52 percent name recognition (as measured by the share of likely voters who can form an opinion of him) from his days as state Senate majority leader. Meanwhile, Republican state Sen. Josh Revak, who used to work for Young, has been <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/04/13/revak-earns-endorsement-from-youngs-widow-in-alaskas-us-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed by his widow</a>. And Anchorage Assemblyman Christopher Constant, former state Rep. Mary Peltola (who would also be the first Alaska Native in Congress) and state Rep. Adam Wool all have the advantage of being <em>actual</em> Democrats; if they don’t go for Gross, Alaska’s Democratic voters have to vote for someone. The problem with all these candidates, though, is that they have all raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/AK/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very little money</a>, and none of them registered above 5 percent in the poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In all honesty, though, it may not matter much who snags the fourth slot. When it comes to the general election, the candidate with the fewest first-place votes will be eliminated and their support redistributed to the candidates their voters ranked second. So unless the complexion of the race changes drastically during the next two months, the fourth-place finisher on Saturday will probably be the first to be eliminated in August. After all, that’s what the Alaska Survey Research poll found, no matter whether <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148601575776256?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeney</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148611402985472?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constant</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148622186541057?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peltola</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148632450043904?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claus</a> was the fourth contender.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, in each scenario, it was Begich who emerged victorious after all the ranked-choice voting rounds were complete. This is certainly not guaranteed to be the case after two months’ of campaigning, but as a starting point, it makes sense: Among the three front-runners, Begich is the ideologically middle choice. If Palin is eliminated second, most of her support is likely to go to fellow Republican Begich, not Gross. And if Gross is eliminated second, most of his support is likely to go to Begich, not Palin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, the outcome of this special election is still far from certain, but it at least looks possible that this is one election where ranked-choice voting could make a material difference. Based on her high profile, Palin may well finish the primary in first place. Under the old system (and the one that most other states use), this would have made her the Republican nominee, and in a red state like Alaska, she likely would have won the general election against whoever Democrats nominated — despite her unpopularity. But the Alaska system prevents her from winning with just a plurality of the vote and ensures that the winner is someone who can (eventually) earn majority support. That probably won’t be Palin.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s 6:30 a.m. and your third alarm is blaring. Another 10 minutes and you’ll have to miss breakfast before going to work. You get up, brush your teeth, shower and start a pot of coffee while watching the morning news. After the station’s meteorologist tells you it’s sunny with a high of 70 degrees, a health reporter follows up with the COVID-19 forecast: red-alert level today, with a 75 percent chance of exposure in spaces with at least 50 people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You respond to the risk by taking a rapid test before leaving the house — snapping a picture of the negative result for your colleagues — and grabbing your N95 mask.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a hypothetical future, but one that a new team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working on. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics</a> got an initial $200 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan to recruit data scientists, epidemiologists and science communicators who will come up with forecasts for the public and promote data-based decision-making. CFA aims to operate “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/04/19/new-cdc-team-early-alert-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the National Weather Service, but for infectious diseases</a>,” said epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers, the new center’s associate director for science, in an April article in The Washington Post.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which would be great — except that the forecasts have less data to work with now than they’ve had in years. COVID-19 case data is less and less reliable thanks to rapid testing, for one. In addition, hospitalization data can lag behind trends in transmission and may become unavailable in the coming months. And new sources like wastewater surveillance aren’t yet ready to replace clinical data. Imagine producing a weather forecast without reliable temperature or humidity measurements.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two converging trends are causing case data to become less useful. First, more Americans are using at-home rapid tests, and second, fewer Americans are using lab-based PCR tests.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">About six times as many at-home tests as PCR tests are being taken in the U.S., according to Mara Aspinall, a diagnostic-testing expert and health-care industry consultant. Using data from test manufacturers and retailers, Aspinall has kept a close eye on test capacity in the U.S. throughout the pandemic, and at this time last year, Americans were taking considerably more PCR tests than at-home tests.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unlike PCR test results, which are automatically reported by the labs that process the tests, the vast majority of at-home test results are not reported to public-health authorities. In recent months, PCR tests have also become less available. States such as <a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/vermont/2022/06/04/vermont-covid-testing-state-stop-free-testing-program-june-25/7496151001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont</a> and <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/04/06/colorado-closing-covid-testing-sites-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado</a> are shutting down free public-testing sites and directing patients to at-home tests and private health-care providers instead — even as government <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/03/29/1089355997/free-covid-tests-and-treatments-no-longer-free-for-uninsured-as-funding-runs-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding to cover tests for uninsured people has run out</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The official numbers we hear about on a daily basis, in terms of official COVID-19 cases, is becoming an increased undercount of the true number of infections that are circulating,” said Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida College of Public Health.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This increasing undercount leads to more uncertainty in COVID-19 forecasting, said Marc Lipsitch, an infectious-disease expert at Harvard and the temporary director of science at CFA. As the quality of case data gets worse, “we’re more reliant on the delayed indicators, like hospitalizations and deaths,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">CFA scientists are currently focused on hospitalization data, which U.S. modelers find more reliable than case numbers: Lipsitch described it as the best source that is “routinely and uniformly reported.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hospital admissions — the number of COVID-19 patients newly admitted for treatment — can be particularly useful, said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas at Austin’s COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. This metric provides “a stabler signal” than case counts, even though it doesn’t typically show an increase until a week or two <em>after</em> a surge. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But when health agencies rely on hospitalization data as their main source for policy decisions, they “lose valuable time to prevent morbidity and mortality,” Salemi said. Essentially, by the time hospital admissions show a meaningful uptick, it’s already too late to prevent a surge that will cause more people to get seriously ill — and it will drive similar increases in long COVID that aren’t visible in hospitalization data at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lipsitch agreed that this delay is a problem. Hospitalization data reflects COVID-19 spread in the recent past; when using data about the past to identify trends in the present, “the present becomes more ambiguous, because the most timely signal was also the lowest quality.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, Salemi said, hospitalization metrics face a problem of geography. While people living in every U.S. county may get infected with SARS-CoV-2, not every county has a hospital. For example, Alachua County, Florida, has a major health-care system where Floridians from several smaller, nearby counties go for treatment. Most of the hospitalizations from this region show up in Alachua County, not in the surrounding areas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even the imperfect hospitalization data may not always be available. When the Biden administration ends the national public-health emergency for COVID-19, hospitals and local health departments <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2022/05/13/the-biden-administration-fights-to-make-its-covid-funds-last-00032279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may no longer be required to report their data</a> to federal agencies. The emergency declaration will <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/politics/covid-19-public-health-emergency/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue beyond at least July 15</a>, but it’s unclear how long the administration will keep extending it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if the data does become even less reliable, then what? CFA is looking into alternatives, and wastewater monitoring is a top priority. Our sewers can provide more timely data than hospitalizations, and less biased data than cases. But wastewater is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-national-fight-against-covid-19-isnt-ready-to-go-to-the-sewers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far from a national surveillance system</a>: COVID-19 levels aren’t being tracked in water systems for much of the country, it takes time and resources to set up this tracking, and health agencies aren’t yet sure how to use the data once they do have it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lipsitch also wants to find a way to pinpoint <em>who</em> in a community is infected, with data that’s individual-level, not population-level like wastewater. Ideally, he would like to see the CDC perform population surveys, sampling a representative subset of Americans to estimate who has COVID-19. Such surveys could contribute to precise estimates of how many people in a given state or county are currently infected, driving forecasts of an individual’s chance at exposure if they go to work or school. British modelers consider similar surveys <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/previousReleases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted by the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics</a> much more reliable than case counts, Lipsitch said. But there’s no comparison for these surveys in the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">CFA’s conversations about potential data sources and public-health actions are largely theoretical at this point, as the center is still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analysis/about/who-we-are.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a team of only four people</a> — three of whom are “on loan” from their academic positions, as Lipsitch described it. Posting job descriptions for the center’s eventual 100 scientists and communicators is “taking longer than we had hoped,” he said. As of early June, <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/job/655773600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only one job posting</a> is open for applications.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As it works on scaling up, CFA faces a broader challenge: the CDC’s lack of authority over state and local health agencies. “Outside of a public-health emergency, CDC has no authority to require states to share data,” Lipsitch said. And even during the COVID-19 emergency, the agency has been unable to require sharing some key metrics, such as <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakthrough cases and deaths</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The CDC also has limited authority over Americans overall, and trust in the public-health system is waning. One recent poll showed that nearly one-third of the country <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thinks the pandemic is already over</a>, while Congress consistently <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/congressional-stalemate-makes-a-quick-compromise-on-covid-funding-unlikely" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fails to deliver new funding</a> for COVID-safety measures. These may be concerning signals for the new forecasting center’s future: Even if the CFA is able to provide timely, accurate infectious-disease forecasts like what we have for the weather, how many people will actually act on the information?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (June 10, 2022, 6:09 p.m.): </strong>The CFA says its team has expanded to 14 people now. Five of them are splitting their time between the center and academic institutions or other CDC offices.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the end of the day on May 24, more than 400 children walked away from Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas as survivors. That single day of grade school will follow them for years, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-school-shootings-impact-survivors-in-the-long-term" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a formative trauma that increases their risks</a> of experiencing depression, missing school days and even earning less money over their lifetimes. Research shows that violence in the classroom harms kids regardless of whether it physically injures them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were also more than 50 million children enrolled at other K-12 schools in the United States that day. Whether they were across town or across the country, many of those children will also have memories of May 24, 2022; sirens, blaring news reports, or the hushed, tense whispers of adults. They know something awful happened to kids just like them. Next year, they’ll do active shooter drills in their own schools and remember that this will be real someday for someone, even if it’s never real for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Is that, also, a kind of trauma? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is precious little known about how the impacts of school shootings ripple out to children in the rest of the community, state and nation. But there’s plenty of research that suggests the trauma of violence in general probably doesn’t stop at the specific location where it happened. And that, experts told me, means we need to be thinking differently about the damage violence can cause and who is at risk. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the high-profile nature of school shootings, and mass shootings more broadly, the mental health impacts of these kinds of events have not been widely studied. Five years ago, Dr. Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health, co-published <a href="https://miningquiz.com/pdf/Mass_Shootings/The-Mental-Health-Consequences-of-Mass-Shootings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a review of research on how mass shootings impact mental health</a>. The 49 peer-reviewed papers he analyzed were mostly focused on what happened to direct survivors — people who were at the site of a mass shooting but left alive. There were only a few that addressed indirect exposure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These studies found evidence of trauma even for those who were not in the room or building where a mass shooting happened, though impacts were larger the closer people were to the actual incident. Other factors — such as media exposure, or the amount of time someone spent discussing the shooting with family and friends — also seemed to affect who came away with symptoms of trauma and how severe they were. But the amount of research on this subject was very small and incomplete, and it’s hard to say much with certainty. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And according to Gaelea that is still true today. “The issue of mental health in community members who are not directly affected… most people in the mental health space think it’s a real issue but there actually has been very little research on it,” he told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, there’s lots of evidence that, in certain situations, people can have their mental health impacted by traumatic events even if they weren’t personally in physical danger. “We’ve known for 20 years that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637659/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching media images of people suffering</a> can, in and of itself, be a trigger for common mood anxiety disorders, things like depression and post-traumatic stress,” Galea said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Evidence suggests there are multiple kinds of indirect trauma, said Jennifer Carlson, a professor of sociology, government and public policy at the University of Arizona. Vicarious trauma, she said, is what happens when people like <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10926771.2012.689422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social workers are deeply exposed to the trauma of their clients</a> and feel helpless to prevent those people from experiencing traumatic events. Community trauma, meanwhile, happens when whole populations are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nuf.12550" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collectively traumatized by something that affects everyone on a cultural level</a>, even if some individuals don’t experience it personally. The traumatic impact of the Holocaust on the Jewish community is a good example of this, as is the collective trauma expressed by Black Americans in the wake of the George Floyd murder. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This knowledge has implications for how we think about the trauma of school shootings, even if we don’t know exactly how school shootings are affecting the mental health of kids nationwide. People who aren’t affected physically by a disaster are often reminded that they have a low risk of experiencing something like that themselves. There are tens of millions of kids enrolled in school every year, but only <a href="https://www.chds.us/ssdb/charts-graphs/#victimsperyear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little over a hundred a year</a> — if that — become direct victims of a school shooting. The risk is low. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s the wrong way to think about risk when we know a traumatic event will happen. The number of school shootings every year that involve active shooters are very small — <a href="https://www.chds.us/ssdb/charts-graphs/#incedentsbyyear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">averaging 5 per year between 2021 and 2011</a>, according to the Naval Postgraduate School’s K-12 School Shooting Database. But you have to go back to 1981 to find a year without at least one. School shootings are almost guaranteed to happen every year — we just don’t know to whom, Carlson said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that means the risk of harm isn’t just about the physical likelihood of being shot, it’s also about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0320-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anticipating a trauma that will happen to someone</a> — maybe even you — and feeling powerless to stop it and at the mercy of chance. “I am a sociologist of crime,” Carlson said. “I’m very much on board with [the idea that] people overestimate their likelihood of victimization.” But this is different, she said. The likelihood of anticipatory trauma can be high even if the risk of injury and death is low. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given that, it’s useless to tell people not to be afraid of something like gun violence. It isn’t just about the personal risk of getting shot, Galea said. In 2016, he published an analysis that found <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27667339/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the chances of an American knowing a gun violence victim at some point</a> in their lifetime are nearly 100 percent. There’s a greater social burden than the statistics of direct risk can show. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are certain moments in congressional history that have lived on even longer than the octogenarians who stalk the halls of Capitol Hill. They are the scenes that feel torn from the pages of a political drama: Sen. Howard Baker Jr. repeatedly asking during the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/curious-history-what-did-president-know-and-when-did-he-know-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watergate hearings</a>, “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” Army lawyer Joseph Welch excoriating Sen. Joseph McCarthy with a rhetorical question during the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/investigations/mccarthy-hearings/have-you-no-sense-of-decency.htm#:~:text=Wisconsin%20Republican%20senator%20Joseph%20R,Department%20and%20other%20federal%20agencies." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Army-McCarthy hearings</a>: “Have you no sense of decency?” A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ZDQKq2F08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel of tobacco executives</a> testifying one by one before Congress, incredulously, that nicotine is not addictive. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under the right circumstances, a congressional hearing can be a satisfying resolution to a tense political conflict, one that allows society to move forward. Doesn’t that sound nice right about now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is hoping its hearings will be remembered in the same light. On Thursday, the committee will begin a run of public hearings to reveal what its investigation has uncovered and provide guidance on how to avoid a similar assault in the future. Rep. Jamie Raskin has promised the hearings will “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-revelations-will-blow-roof-house-rep-jamie-raskin-says-rcna25542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blow the roof off the House</a>,” and in a statement to FiveThirtyEight, Rep. Adam Schiff said, “I wouldn’t expect these hearings to look like a typical congressional hearing.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But surely both of these majority committee members know how difficult it will be to change the public’s mind about what happened on Jan. 6, 2021. Polling shows many Americans (especially Republicans) think <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-moving-on-from-jan-6-even-if-congress-hasnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too much attention</a> has been paid to the attacks and say they are ready to “move on.” Furthermore, people who participated in the riot or support the “Big Lie,” the baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen, have already secured nominations across the country in primary elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, what makes for a memorable hearing? Well, taking place in the ’70s and ’80s is one ingredient. That was the golden age of congressional hearings, when the country was less polarized and news consumption more homogeneous. But maybe there’s still something to learn from those hearings of yesteryear — they may offer some hints as to how the Jan. 6 committee can recapture the magic.</p>



<h2><strong>New information</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In July 1973, two months into the Senate Watergate hearings, a former White House assistant named Alexander Butterfield made a startling revelation: There were recording devices in the West Wing. This disclosure not only shocked the public but also marked the beginning of the end for then-President Richard Nixon’s administration. While reporting from The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein revealed many details of the Watergate scandal, it wasn’t until the hearings — where individuals with firsthand knowledge were obliged to testify — that Nixon’s involvement became undeniable. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Excavating new information is what hearings are designed to do, and it can make them more appealing to the public, and more likely to effect change, according to Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg" alt="Alexander Butterfield Testifying" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Alexander Butterfield, a former deputy assistant to President Richard Nixon, brought a blockbuster revelation to the Watergate Senate hearings in 1973. <p>Bettman / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In fact, we can see that impact in polling conducted before and during the Watergate hearings. At the start of these televised hearings in May 1973, the Watergate scandal had already knocked Nixon’s approval rating down 20 percentage points in four months to 48 percent, and by early August, it had dropped to 31 percent, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/25/how-the-watergate-crisis-eroded-public-support-for-richard-nixon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup polling cited by the Pew Research Center</a>. Likewise, prior to the hearings, 31 percent of Americans said they believed Watergate was a serious matter and not just politics, but by August, that number had climbed to a 53 percent majority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Committee members also elicit new information by asking fact-finding questions, not by using these public hearings simply as a stage from which to speechify. But this is Congress — speechifying is an inevitability. Especially these days. Ju Yeon Park, a political scientist at the University of Essex who studies the communication style of American legislators, has found that <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/709147?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grandstanding</a> — which she defines as using “hearings as opportunities to send political messages by taking positions on policy issues or framing the image of a party or the administration” — has grown more common in congressional hearings in recent years. She also has forthcoming research that shows more time spent grandstanding is correlated with better performance in the following election (which may, uh, help explain this behavior). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s tough to know, then, whether the Jan. 6 hearings will reveal new information or simply provide a platform for partisan grandstanding ahead of the midterms. There are still many unresolved questions about what happened in the days leading up to and on the day of the attack, and perhaps the hearings will be able to answer them.  </p>



<h2><strong>Insider witnesses</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another common component of history-making hearings is an insider witness. Congress has unique subpoena powers that can compel individuals to testify who may not otherwise have volunteered to do so. This has resulted in key moments like Butterfield’s revelation in 1973 or the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-09-mn-3189-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1987 testimony of former National Security aide Lt. Col. Oliver North</a>, when he took the fall for the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal during President Ronald Reagan’s administration. It has also facilitated moments when new information came to light and made for less partisan hearings, according to Jonathan Lewallen, a political scientist at the University of Tampa and the author of “Committees and the Decline of Lawmaking in Congress.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those witnesses can make a hearing feel like more than just one long session of ax grinding — and there’s been more of that lately, too. In recent years, Congress has held fewer hearings and is hearing from fewer witnesses, and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rego.12090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to research</a> from Lewallen published in 2015, those witnesses are presenting a narrower range of views. Lewallen and his colleagues found that, over the past 40 years, a greater share of congressional hearings are positional (essentially arguing only one side of an issue) rather than exploratory (when all sides of an issue are considered). In 1977-1978, only 19 percent of the hearings held were positional, but in 2007-2008, 30 percent were. Lewallen said that is due partly to having fewer witnesses and over-relying on government appointees, who are less likely to push against the party line.</p>

Republican figures who were heavily involved with then-President Donald Trump’s actions on the day of the Capitol attack have refused to testify to the committee, and as a result, at least two have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/politics/peter-navarro-contempt-jan-6.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/politics/peter-navarro-contempt-jan-6.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charged with contempt of Congress</a>. Former White House chief of staff <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jan-6-house-committee-meadows-trump/2021/12/14/ae2d10a8-5ce9-11ec-ae5b-5002292337c7_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Meadows</a>, Trump’s onetime lawyer <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-new-york-mayor-giuliani-refuses-testify-before-us-capitol-riot-panel-2022-05-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rudy Giuliani</a>, former White House chief strategist <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-subpoena-capitol-attack-trump-1638839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Bannon</a> and a handful of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/gop-lawmakers-testimony-capitol-riot-00029322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP members of Congress</a> have all refused to testify. In May, the committee took the unprecedented step of actually <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/12/1098509467/mccarthy-jan-6-panel-subpoena-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpoenaing their Republican colleagues</a> to testify. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The committee has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/10/politics/list-january-6-subpoenas/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpoenaed dozens of witnesses</a>, many of whom were either involved in planning the Trump rally that preceded the attack or helped him with his baseless campaign to overturn the 2020 election results, which fueled the attack. So, even if big names aren’t cooperating, we may hear some illuminating testimony. The committee also benefits from the mountain of media created on the day of the attack, including videos and photos from the attackers themselves. In his statement, Schiff said the committee “will present the evidence we have gathered through both live testimony and a variety of media, so as to be both highly engaging and deeply informative.”</p>



<h2><strong>Bipartisanship</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">That moment when Butterfield acknowledged the existence of recording devices in the West Wing was not only a revelation for the American public but also a carefully orchestrated moment of bipartisanship. Butterfield had already <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3447219&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the taping system</a> in a closed-door interview with committee staff three days before his public testimony. Since a Republican lawyer had asked the question that elicited Butterfield’s admission in the background interview, the committee agreed it was only fair to let a Republican ask the question on the public record, and so it was decided that the committee’s minority counsel, Fred Thompson (who was later elected to the Senate, in 1994) would be the one to do so. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bipartisanship also played a key role in many famous hearings in U.S. history, according to Troy. “In the Army-McCarthy hearings, Eisenhower was working behind the scenes to try to make McCarthy look bad. So the Republicans were working with the Democrats to make it come out in a certain way. Obviously in the Watergate hearings, the Republicans were brought in for the big questions,” Troy said. “Cooperation brings better results — and results that the American people can embrace.”</p>

One example, he noted, was a <a href="https://www.levin-center.org/congress-investigates-kkk-violence-during-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional hearing after the Civil War</a> to investigate an emerging terrorist organization in the South: the Ku Klux Klan. While the hearings themselves were bipartisan, the Democrats rejected the findings laid out in the majority report and issued a minority report refuting all the facts found in the hearings, Townsend said. As a result, the hearings weren’t able to sway many minds.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Democrats constructed an alternative narrative. I mean, frankly, their own alternative facts that denied the existence of the KKK and put the blame on Northern so-called agitators and African Americans,” Townsend said. “We’ve been here before: an incredibly divided country where basic facts about whether terrorism, violent aggression against some people in our country was being explained in two very different ways.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well documented</a> at this point that American politics have become increasingly polarized over the past few decades. This affects not only how <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American voters view one another</a> but also how much they trust elected officials who don’t belong to the political party they identify with. When asked whether each major political party could be described “very” or “somewhat” well as “govern[ing] in an honest and ethical way,” Americans rarely agreed when it came to the opposing party, according to a January <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-the-republican-and-democratic-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Pew</a>. Just 17 percent of Democrats said the Republican Party governed honestly and ethically, and 13 percent of Republicans said the same about the Democratic Party. Trust in the government overall has been <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declining for decades</a> as well, and partisans typically trust the government less when the opposing party is in power, according to Pew. And while Americans’ positive feelings toward their own party have remained steady since the ’70s, their <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/for-2015-0030/html?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive feelings about the opposing party have been falling</a> — the gulf is only getting wider. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Positive feelings toward the other party have dropped sharply" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oTkZB/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">All of these findings underscore the importance of bipartisanship when trying to convene an effective hearing. To persuade partisans to pay attention and care about the information being presented, it has to come from their side of the aisle. “If one side — Republicans — are saying this is a partisan sideshow, then Republicans in the electorate are going to say this is a partisan sideshow,” said Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has been tracking the increasingly chilly feelings between partisans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this respect, the Jan. 6 hearings may have already failed before they’ve even begun. Although the committee is technically bipartisan, a majority of the members are Democrats. And including Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger — two of the 10 Republicans <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/14/956621191/these-are-the-10-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who voted to impeach</a> Trump after Jan. 6 — hasn’t inspired a ton of faith among Republicans: In a March 31-April 4 <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Navigator-Toplines-04.05.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from Global Strategy Group/GBAO</a>, 60 percent of Republicans said they agreed with a statement calling the Jan. 6 committee’s investigation “a partisan witch hunt.” Not to mention that Republicans in Congress have opposed the committee from the very beginning: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had GOP members <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000524897/senate-republicans-block-plan-for-independent-commission-on-jan-6-capitol-riot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block an independent commission</a> to investigate the attack. Then, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pelosi-mccarthy-jan6-committee/2021/07/21/21722d44-ea41-11eb-84a2-d93bc0b50294_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked two Republicans</a> from joining the commission, McCarthy <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mccarthys-jan-6-committee-gamble-faces-big-test-spring-rcna23681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had fellow Republicans boycott the commission</a> and what little good will was left likely evaporated. The upcoming hearings will likely elicit a similar response. In April, McCarthy told NBC: “This is nothing but a political show.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There have already been <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/query/0484b316-f676-44bc-97ed-ecefeabae077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">248 mass shootings this year</a>,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of June 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> according to the Gun Violence Archive. At this point in 2021, there had been 258 mass shootings; in 2020, 173. Mass shootings are defined by the Gun Violence Archive as incidents in which at least four people — not including the shooter — are injured or killed, and they have been on the rise in recent years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It is often a select few mass shootings, though, that capture national headlines and spark outrage. Public opinion often shifts <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/support-for-gun-control-will-likely-rise-after-uvalde-but-history-suggests-it-will-fade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in favor of stricter gun laws</a> after high-profile mass shootings, like the one on May 14 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/14/nyregion/buffalo-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed 10 people in a racist attack</a> in Buffalo, New York, and the one on May 24 that killed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/victims-texas-school-shooting-uvalde/story?id=84948395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 children and two teachers</a> at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It should be no surprise, then, that the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a>, which was conducted from May 26 to June 6 and went into the field two days after the shooting in Uvalde, found that concerns regarding gun violence had surged. Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we interviewed the same 2,000 or so Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-2000-americans-about-their-biggest-concern-the-resounding-answer-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from our previous survey</a>, and of the 1,691 adults who responded, 42 percent named “crime or gun violence” as one of the most important issues facing the country, up 19 percentage points from the first wave of the poll released in early May.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.9 percentage points. As was the case in the first wave of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> This was by far the largest increase for any one issue we asked about, putting it behind only “inflation or increasing costs” as Americans’ top concern for the country.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="More Americans are concerned about gun violence" aria-label="Range Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2sVNi/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="593" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">How concerned Americans were about crime and/or gun violence did vary quite a bit by party, though, as Democrats and independents drove much of the shift. A solid majority of Democrats, 58 percent, named the issue as a top concern, up from 33 percent in early May, while 41 percent of independents said the same, up from 19 percent.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independents included respondents who identified as “independent” or “something else,” or who skipped the question for party identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> Republicans also became more worried about crime and/or gun violence, but the uptick was much smaller, going from 19 percent in May to 29 percent now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also found a sizable jump in the share of Black and Hispanic Americans who named crime and/or gun violence as one of the biggest issues for the country, which helps explain, in part, the higher degree of concern among Democrats, as Democrats <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/pp_2020-06-02_party-id_2-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more racially and ethnically diverse</a> than Republicans. The share of Hispanic Americans who cited the issue more than doubled, growing from 23 percent in May to 61 percent. To a lesser but still significant extent, the share of Black Americans who named gun violence or crime as a top issue also jumped, going from 35 percent in early May to 55 percent in our latest survey. White Americans were also more likely to be worried, but their overall level of concern was comparably lower: Thirty-five percent named the issue as a top worry, up from 19 percent a month ago.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of this dramatic shift can be explained by the sheer amount of media attention gun violence received in the days following the shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde. In fact, three-fourths of respondents reported having heard “a lot” about crime and/or gun violence in the news, more attention than any other issue we asked about received — even inflation (which around two-thirds said they had heard a lot about).<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked whether they had seen a lot of coverage of the 20 major issues we asked about in the past month, including “other” and “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, as we said at the outset, this is often what happens in the wake of a high-profile mass shooting. As a result of heightened media coverage, there is an uptick in concern about gun violence and/or a lot more support for stricter gun laws. However, the spotlight tends to fade over time and shift to other issues, so Americans become less engaged with the issue and support for stricter gun laws reverts to where it once stood. We didn’t ask about support for stricter gun laws in this poll, but we do know that more Americans are worried about gun violence. Even before this survey, it was one of Americans’ top three issues, so we plan to follow up soon with a deeper dive to better understand what’s driving Americans’ concerns around gun violence and/or crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nothing changed quite as much as Americans’ concern around crime and/or gun violence in our poll, but there were a handful of other important changes regarding which issues Americans felt were most pressing for the country. Abortion, for instance, saw the second-largest change on net, likely thanks to increased media coverage of the issue in early May following <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion</a> that suggests the court might be ready to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973. Nine percent of respondents in our survey named it as a top issue, up from just 4 percent a month ago. That said, abortion isn’t the issue that Americans in our poll are most worried about.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather, that distinction still belongs to inflation. Americans are most worried about inflation, with even more respondents (56 percent) naming it as a concern than in our last survey (52 percent). This was in large part driven by Republicans, as 75 percent cited inflation as a major concern, up from 65 percent a month ago. Independents were also somewhat more likely to name it as a concern, 56 percent now versus 50 percent in May. Roughly 40 percent of Democrats named inflation as a concern, but this barely changed from our previous survey.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, political extremism and polarization remained a top issue overall, ranking third behind inflation and crime/gun violence after ranking second in our last survey. We dug more into this issue, too, and Americans' attitudes around political extremism and polarization in this survey, so we’ll examine those results more in-depth in an article early next week. But as we’ve outlined here, there’s no question that the big, topline finding in our second FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll is that more Americans are concerned about crime and/or gun violence — at least for now.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, seven states held primary contests — California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew breaks down what the results in those states mean. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, more moderate candidates were able to win against challengers from the right (Republicans) and left (Democrats), although there was a sizable protest vote in some instances. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Contests in California served as a test of the strength of progressive appeals in a very blue state’s big cities. Progressive San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin was recalled in a landslide, and former Republican Rick Caruso advanced to the Los Angeles mayoral general election alongside Democratic Rep. Karen Bass. There were a couple surprises throughout the night, notably in Iowa, where once-rising Democratic star Abby Finkenauer lost the Senate primary to Mike Franken. The question, of course, remains whether a Democrat has any chance of winning a statewide election in a state that has swung decisively to the right.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Before 2018, most women in the Republic of Ireland were able to get abortions only if they traveled to a clinic in England or Wales or had a <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2020/04/01/self-managed-abortion-is-medically-very-safe-but-is-it-legally-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-managed</a> abortion at home, but figuring out how to do either of those options was difficult.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Information on abortion was censored in the first years of the ban, which took effect in 1983<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion was first banned in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1861 by the &lt;a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1861/act/100/enacted/en/print.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Offences Against the Person Act. The law&lt;/a&gt; stayed in place after Irish independence in 1922 but was effectively reinforced in a referendum in 1983, when anti-abortion activists backed by the Catholic Church thought Ireland would follow other Western democracies in loosening abortion restrictions and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-irelands-history-with-abortion-might-teach-us-about-a-post-roe-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;launched a campaign to preserve the ban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a>. Certain books were <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/publications-on-abortion-coming-off-banned-books-list-1.3960794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prohibited</a>, and even the Irish edition of Cosmopolitan magazine had <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-03-11-mn-218-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blank pages instead of adverts</a> for British clinics. Meanwhile, those who sought abortions faced isolation, stigma and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6237647/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited help from medical professionals</a>. And for the few who were able to overcome those barriers and somehow reach one of the feminist networks that could help with information, logistics and fundraising, they still might <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/abortion-ireland-northern-ireland-women-travel-england-amelia-gentleman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay hundreds of pounds or more</a> for the procedure, transportation, meals and a hotel. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fiona de Londras, the chair of global legal studies at the University of Birmingham in the U.K., told me that Irish officials would question women on ferries and in airports “if they looked young and kind of pregnant-y.” If you were pregnant in Ireland, you <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/eighth-amendment-casts-shadow-over-care-for-pregnant-women-1.3454604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might not have access to medical care</a> that could potentially affect the fetus, even for something like cancer, de Londras said. “The only thing the woman [was] entitled to from the state is that she’s not dead at the end of the pregnancy,” she said. “Apart from that, the state’s obligation was to the fetus.”</p>

Though the U.K.’s 1967 Abortion Act established the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks into pregnancy, and later than that in certain circumstances, the devolved government of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-56041849" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Northern Ireland did not pass the legislation&lt;/a&gt;, and by law, anyone obtaining an abortion could be subject to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/15/abortion-law-harsher-northern-ireland-alabama-campaigners" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;life in prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a> From 1983 to 2018, “the right to life of the unborn” was <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-referendum-1983-what-happened-1225430-Dec2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equal to the “right to life of the mother</a>,” and the state was empowered to “defend and vindicate that right.” This was enshrined in the Irish Constitution’s Eighth Amendment, which two-thirds of voters approved in a 1983 referendum. Furthermore, under Irish law, performing or obtaining an abortion was punishable by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43961988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 14 years</a> in prison. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this didn’t stop abortions in Ireland. Abortions happened anyway, both abroad and underground. But the fact that they still happened — and that they were still in demand — didn’t make the effort to legalize them any easier. It took another 35 years for abortion to become legal in Ireland — and a steady stream of activism and high-profile stories of suffering for abortion rights to expand. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What happened there is an extreme example of the effects of outlawing abortion. The circumstances around abortion rights in the U.S. are different in crucial ways, yet Ireland’s story is instructive because it offers clues as to what could be in store here. And it raises a question that plagued Irish abortion-rights activists for years: What will it take for people to change their minds?</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Before <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Samuel Alito’s majority draft opinion</a> in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked in May, most Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-the-first-time-in-years-democrats-are-more-concerned-about-abortion-than-republicans-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t think Roe v. Wade would likely be overturned</a>. The nearly 50-year-old legal precedent that established the constitutional right to abortion had created a kind of complacency in the status quo that meant most Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, didn’t think Roe was at serious risk of not being the law of the land anymore. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polling on abortion</a> is complicated, but it does show that most Americans don’t want to spend much time thinking about it. Moreover, they don’t actually know a lot about abortion — or, for that matter, pregnancy. Most Americans tend to think both the left and the right are extreme on the issue, and so they avoid the debate altogether. And while it’s true that most Americans don’t think Roe should be overturned, they also don’t know exactly what Roe allows, which means they sometimes support restrictions that conflict with it. Many Americans also don’t know what will happen in their states if Roe is overturned. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This general lack of knowledge existed in Ireland before the <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-referendum-1983-what-happened-1225430-Dec2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referendum establishing fetal personhood was passed</a>, as abortion hadn’t been legal or commonly acknowledged. What’s different in the United States, of course, is that the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to take away a right that has already existed for many women. But the example of Ireland shows that Americans still may not know the full consequences of denying pregnant people access to those rights, including their own rights to a healthy life.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It took almost a decade for the broader Irish public to become aware of the dire consequences faced by those who are denied abortions. In 1991, <a href="https://www.irishlegal.com/articles/irish-legal-heritage-the-introduction-of-internment-in-ireland-for-14-year-old-girls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 14-year-old girl was raped</a> by the father of one of her friends. The attorney general filed an injunction prohibiting her and her parents from traveling to England to seek an abortion because the law compelled the state to protect the life of the fetus. During that time, the girl was expressing suicidal thoughts, and a clinical psychologist testified in a court hearing that the girl was at risk of killing herself; ultimately, the Irish Supreme Court decided to set aside the initial court ruling, thus allowing the girl to get an abortion because <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43962738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there was a real threat of suicide</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The girl’s case <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/twenty-years-on-a-timeline-of-the-x-case-347359-Feb2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparked widespread protests</a> both for and against abortion rights, but in the end, de Londras said, “It was maybe the first time society as a whole understood the extent of the restriction the Eighth Amendment actually created in Irish law.” As a result of the case, referendums in 1992 established that Irish citizens couldn’t be prevented from traveling abroad for a legal abortion or from learning about abortion services in other countries.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another turning point was in 2012, when 31-year-old dentist <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/roe-wade-savita-halappanavar-abortion-pregnancy-case-ireland-1702913" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Savita Halappanavar</a> started to have a miscarriage at a hospital but was denied an abortion because a fetal heartbeat could still be detected. Despite her pleas for treatment over the course of several days, she developed sepsis, experienced multiple organ failure and died of cardiac arrest. The doctors almost certainly misunderstood the law, but Halappanavar’s death gave more women in Ireland space to talk about pregnancy care and abortions, and movements started for women to share their stories anonymously. </p>

It created an environment where people didn’t want to talk about abortion,” she said. That began to change, though, in the aftermath of Halappanavar’s death, and it became clear that most people wanted reform. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, it simply got easier for women to have a self-managed abortion at home. In 1988,  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/24/us/france-and-china-allow-sale-of-a-drug-for-early-abortion.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France and China</a> approved the use of mifepristone<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medication then known as RU-486.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a>to induce abortions early in pregnancy, in combination with a prostaglandin such as misoprostol; <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2002/05/mifepristone-early-medical-abortion-experiences-france-great-britain-and#:~:text=Registered%20regimens%20largely%20reflect%20the,regimens%20for%20early%20medical%20abortion." target="_blank" rel="noopener">other European countries</a> soon followed suit. With the rise of the Internet and the growing availability of these medications — they could be sent through the mail after an online consultation — the use of this regimen grew over the following years. (It wasn’t illegal to obtain the medications in Ireland, only to use them.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2005, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts founded <a href="https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/521/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women on Web</a>, a nonprofit group that offers consultations to anyone in the world seeking an abortion who cannot get one legally or safely and provides the medications they need to self-manage an abortion at home. <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.14401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studies showed</a> that women in Ireland began using Women on Web and similar services and were happy and relieved to be able to end their pregnancies without having to travel abroad. They would also recommend these services to friends. The increase in medication abortions highlighted how simple and safe abortions could be. When the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment passed in 2018, it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45568094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got 66.4 percent of the vote</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Is the U.S. now headed down the same path as Ireland once was? The laws poised to go into effect in many states if Roe is overturned are extreme and unpopular. Thirteen states <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-bans-restrictons-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would ban abortions outright</a> either immediately or within weeks, although all 13 states make some sort of exception for the life and health of the mother. Many do not make exceptions in cases of rape or incest, however, according to an analysis from The New York Times. And the Center for Reproductive Rights found that overturning or weakening Roe would <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/what-if-roe-fell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectively ban abortion in 24 states and three U.S. territories</a>, even if local laws don’t ban it explicitly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, not only do women already have trouble accessing safe abortions when restrictions are in place, but reproductive health care is affected in other ways. For instance, data shows that in the U.S., being pregnant and giving birth is more dangerous than getting an abortion, which means that if Roe is overturned, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/overturning-roe-v-wade-could-make-maternal-mortality-even-worse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal mortality rates are likely to get worse</a> — and many of these deaths would be entirely preventable. Being denied an abortion can also have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/05/15/1098347992/a-landmark-study-tracks-the-lasting-effect-of-having-an-abortion-or-being-denied" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lasting mental-health effects</a>. If Ireland is any example, a lot more women in America will have to die or experience mental-health issues before attitudes toward abortion care dramatically shift.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240664864-711.jpg" alt="Pro-choice supporters at a rally in Texas" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240664864-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240664864-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240664864-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>After the U.S. Supreme Court refused to stop Texas’s six-week abortion ban from taking effect and the court’s majority draft opinion that would overturn Roe was leaked, more Americans started supporting abortion rights. <p>Montinique Monroe / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">There are signs that attitudes in the U.S. are already changing, however. Tresa Undem, a public-opinion researcher who co-founded the nonpartisan polling firm PerryUndem, said that since a <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/08/impact-texas-abortion-ban-14-fold-increase-driving-distance-get-abortion?gclid=CjwKCAjwyryUBhBSEiwAGN5OCLgt-d0iERbFMUFekujipB89tnrwQiltGruMb9nvV2Zqm7itIGAUqBoCpMgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban on abortions after six weeks</a> went into effect in Texas, more Texans are aware of anti-abortion laws; in addition, Undem told me, men and independent women voters were talking and thinking about the issue more than they had previously. “For the first time since I’ve been doing research, I heard them really take this issue extremely personally and change their behavior.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Undem said that sustained news coverage penetrating into local news may be making people more aware of the consequences of Roe being overturned, and this in turn may be making them become more engaged on the issue. For example, a Gallup poll conducted between May 2 and May 22 found that the share of Americans identifying as pro-choice <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped 6 percentage points, to 55 percent</a>, since May 2021. Much of that shift was driven by more Democrats and Democratic-leaning groups like younger adults and women identifying as such; nevertheless, more Americans than not said they wanted abortion to be legal in all or most circumstances.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the realities of pre-Roe life are in the distant past for most Americans. “People just don’t believe [the worst stories],” said Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law. “And if they do believe that, they don’t get what it’s going to be like, because they’ve never lived through it.” The stories that really change people’s minds are often extreme, she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider the stories that ultimately sparked change in Ireland, and how long it took for that change to happen. In reality, many women in the U.S. are already living under similar conditions to those in Ireland before the Eighth Amendment was overturned. But because these stories mostly involve women who are already marginalized — women of color, poor women, undocumented women and women in Southern states — much of the country has not been motivated so far to act to change those conditions. “It’s Black and brown women who are dying now,” said Michele Goodwin, a professor at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. Americans are inured to Black women’s suffering and death, she said. “We shouldn’t have to look any further than the maternal mortality rates in this country to say, ‘Let’s just stay out of women’s reproductive health.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But so far, that hasn’t happened. In fact, it seems likely that red and red-leaning states will continue to pass restrictive laws whether or not Roe is overturned, while abortion-rights activists will try to help women overcome them. Activists in blue states haven’t been working to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-rights-havent-been-a-priority-in-blue-states-until-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ensure abortion rights in their own states</a> until very recently, and that is in part because the unusual legal system in the U.S. makes federal actions to expand rights much more difficult to implement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible, though, that movements for expanding abortion rights worldwide will offer insight into what’s possible for the U.S. After all, abortion rights have expanded in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45568094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/21/abortion-to-be-decriminalised-in-northern-ireland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47890065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Korea</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/world/asia/thailand-abortion-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034925270/mexico-abortion-decriminalized-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/21/1082236222/colombias-highest-court-legalizes-abortion-up-to-24-weeks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colombia</a> and other countries around the globe recently, and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1096840071/striking-down-roe-v-wade-will-hit-people-of-color-hardest-activists-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reproductive-justice movement</a> has also been taken up again in many states. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, the movement to restrict abortion rights, now arguably at the height of its success, might be what ultimately prevails in the U.S. Even though these views are held only by a small minority of the public, the anti-abortion movement has worked relentlessly to overcome the structural barriers in the political system for some 50 years, and they’re potentially on the cusp of their biggest victory yet. “The way they’ve chipped away at the meaningful right to access abortion, the way they’ve captured Supreme Court nominee processes … that level of organization and commitment, that’s what works in a fragmented setting like this,” de Londras said. “Even if one says so with grudging admiration, what they’ve done is very extraordinary.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Politics in Los Angeles are as complicated and knotty as its highway system. L.A. has so much inequality over so much space that its residents often want wildly different things from their politicians — even if nearly all of those politicians are Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The city’s open-seat mayoral election — whose first round<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field will winnow to two candidates as long as no candidate gets above 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> takes place on Tuesday — reflects that paradox, with a pileup of Democrats pitching solutions to a city of 3.9 million residents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two of the 12 candidates on the ballot are clear front-runners: Rep. Karen Bass and billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso have made public safety and cost of living central issues in their campaigns, but they have dramatically different visions of what a safer, more affordable L.A. should look like. Bass, who led the state Assembly before serving a decade in the U.S. House of Representatives, is the more progressive of the two. The former chair of the Black Congressional Caucus has leaned into her background as a community organizer in the city, highlighting her “<a href="https://twitter.com/KarenBassLA/status/1531689578830385153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crisis-tested</a>” skill set that would help her address homelessness as a pressing economic and public health crisis. Caruso, meanwhile, is a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/meet-kim-kardashian-gwyneth-paltrow-and-snoop-doggs-candidate-for-mayor-of-l-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Republican</a> who has blanketed the airwaves with <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-22/how-bad-is-crime-in-l-a-here-are-the-numbers-behind-the-mayoral-race-rhetoric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dire depictions</a> of the city’s uptick in crime, promising to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSa47i5fJtU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clean up</a>” the streets and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qs13uh9Xbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire 1,500 more police officers</a>. His <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-07/caruso-has-now-loaned-his-campaign-10-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big spending</a> has helped him clear the field; in recent weeks, other candidates who sought to position themselves in the moderate lane have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-23/ramit-varma-drops-out-of-mayoral-race-endorses-rick-caruso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> and <a href="https://abc7.com/buscaino-caruso-mayor-campaign/11841436/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> him. L.A. Councilman Kevin de León — the only major Latino candidate in a city that is <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/losangelescitycalifornia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost half Latino</a> — is also running but has lagged behind Bass and Caruso in polls. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This election poses a problem for us incorrigible election-watchers: The major candidates are all Democrats, and Los Angeles is an almost uniformly Democratic city. So, to make sense of the city’s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2021-12-01/la-voters-are-frustrated-impatient-over-persistent-homelessness-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political fissures</a> (and there certainly <a href="https://usceconreview.com/2019/04/03/the-negative-implications-of-los-angeles-increasing-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are plenty</a>), we needed something more sophisticated. When we ran into the same problem sizing up the mayoral election in deep-blue New York City last year, we tried to show that its politics were far more complex than just “solidly Democratic” by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-5-political-boroughs-of-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dividing the city into five “political boroughs”</a> based on the results of recent Democratic primaries. It’s only fair, then, that we give L.A. the same treatment on the occasion of its own big municipal election. (Let no one accuse FiveThirtyEight of East Coast bias!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve carved up Los Angeles into six political regions based on the <a href="https://www.lavote.gov/home/voting-elections/current-elections/election-results/past-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results</a><a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used “ballot groups” — essentially, clusters of precincts that all fall within the same political jurisdictions — as the building blocks for our regions. However, we omitted ballot groups with fewer than 100 ballots cast in the presidential race due to lack of data. You can find which ballot groups are in which region in the footnotes, although note that ballot groups change with every election. The ballot groups referenced in this article are for the 2020 general election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> of seven elections on the November 2020 ballot: the presidential race, the district attorney’s race and five high-profile local ballot measures.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Together, these elections encapsulate several modern political cleavages: </p>

But even if you don’t care about who leads Los Angeles, these regions also highlight broader truths common to many American cities: People of color are strong Democrats but aren’t necessarily strong liberals; trendy white neighborhoods have some of the most progressive politics in the city; Latinos can’t be pegged to a single political identity; and even in dark-blue cities, you can still find support for conservative candidates and causes.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">None of these results is surprising when you consider that South Central residents are almost all people of color: 68 percent of the voting-age population here is Hispanic, while 22 percent are Black; by contrast, only 5 percent of the voting-age population in this political neighborhood is white.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For concision throughout this article, we use the terms “white,” “Black” and “Asian American” to refer to people of one race who are non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic Asian American, respectively. The Hispanic population can be of any race. All demographic data is from the 2020 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although Black residents are not the majority in this region, predominantly Black areas do set the tone for some of its politics: Biden’s, Measure J’s and Proposition 16’s best showings in South Central came in majority-Black ballot groups like those in Hyde Park. Yet the neighborhood’s strong support for Proposition 15 was driven mostly by heavily Hispanic areas. While support for raising taxes on commercial properties reached as high as 70 percent in Hispanic ballot groups, it was closer to 60 percent in Black ones.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">South Central may be strongly Democratic and liberal on certain issues, but it’s not necessarily a progressive stronghold. With <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-02/in-south-l-a-police-join-community-leaders-to-denounce-gun-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high crime rates</a> being a perennial problem in this neighborhood, a significant number of voters here supported Lacey and her <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-31/jackie-lacey-george-gascon-everything-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more punitive approach</a> to preventing crime. (She also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-01/jackie-lacey-grew-up-in-south-l-a-but-in-a-tough-d-a-s-race-her-opponents-are-encroaching-on-her-home-turf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grew up in the neighborhood</a>.) South Central supported Gascón for district attorney with only 57 percent of the vote, below his citywide haul of 59 percent. And despite Proposition 22’s cap on gig workers’ benefits, residents of this working-class neighborhood may have been convinced by Uber and Lyft’s argument that <a href="https://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/2020/10/30/gig-companies-threatening-eliminate-thousands-jobs-if-prop-22-doesnt-pass/6072162002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobs would be cut</a> if the measure failed. Proposition 22 passed here 55 percent to 45 percent, making South Central its second-best neighborhood.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It will be interesting to see who wins out here in the mayor’s race. As a Black Democrat who represents part of the neighborhood in Congress, Bass seems a good fit on paper. But Caruso’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/rick-caruso-los-angeles-mayor-candidate-reactionary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more populist tendencies</a> — such as talking tough on crime — could appeal to South Central too.</p>

That’s where you’ll find the hip neighborhoods of Silver Lake, Echo Park and Los Feliz, as well as Northeast Los Angeles, a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood with a suburban feel.

<p data-paragraph="main">This is indisputably L.A.’s most progressive region. It was the strongest of our six neighborhoods for Gascón as well as for all the further-left positions on the local ballot measures. Most notably, it was the only neighborhood to break strongly with Big Tech on Proposition 22, voting against it 59 percent to 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taken as a whole, the True-Blue Progressives neighborhood is racially and ethnically mixed; Latinos are the biggest demographic group, but they make up only 38 percent of the area’s voting-age population. However, the white voting-age population is larger than the citywide average. Interestingly, there aren’t significant differences in how the plurality-Hispanic and plurality-white parts of this neighborhood vote; both are dyed-in-the-wool progressive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the mayoral race, it would be a big surprise if Bass didn’t crush Caruso here. But de León could post good numbers here too, considering that he represents parts of Northeast L.A. on the <a href="https://councildistrict14.com/our-neighborhoods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">city council</a>. He hasn’t fully embraced progressivism in his <a href="https://www.kevindeleon.com/public-safety-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mayoral campaign</a>, but he did run for U.S. Senate in 2018 as a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-usc-latimes-poll-senate-20181018-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal alternative</a> to Sen.

<p data-paragraph="main">With a demographic composition that’s similar to the city’s as a whole, the population of this area is diverse, and most of its voting population is liberal. It was Biden’s, Gascón’s, Measure J’s, Proposition 15’s and Proposition 21’s second-best political neighborhood. But where it differs from the True-Blue Progressives is its vote on Proposition 22: Fair-Weather Progressives voted to give gig workers the benefits of full employment by a tighter margin of 52 percent to 48 percent. On the spectrum of progressivism, then, this neighborhood falls somewhere between True-Blue Progressives and South Central.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Predominantly white ballot groups like those covering Sawtelle and ballot groups with significant Asian American populations like those in Koreatown were less supportive of Biden than the neighborhood’s Hispanic sectors. Those white ballot groups were also more skeptical of affirmative action and expanded rent control.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Expect the Fair-Weather Progressives to support Bass for mayor; her orientation as more-progressive-than-Caruso-but-not-capital-P-progressive seems to be a perfect fit for voters here. But de León will be counting on a strong showing here too, especially in Downtown and Eastside L.A., which are also largely in his city council district.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This neighborhood neither swung as hard for Biden as the more left-leaning neighborhoods nor swung as hard for Lacey as the more conservative neighborhoods. Gascón overperformed his citywide averages in Tinseltown by 3 percentage points, while Biden ran about average. And when it comes to the propositions, Tinseltown was fairly middle-of-the-pack. While Proposition 16 passed here with a slightly smaller margin compared with the citywide average, Propositions 15 and 21 basically matched the L.A. averages. The most significant differentiator was Proposition 22, which failed by the narrowest of margins (fewer than 5,000 votes out of almost 131,000 cast).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though its 2020 voting pattern is pretty similar to the city’s overall, Tinseltown doesn’t particularly resemble L.A as a whole. Among all the political neighborhoods, this one has by far the largest share of the white voting-age population, at 63 percent, and it’s the only political neighborhood where every ballot group is at least a plurality white. It also has the smallest share of the Hispanic voting-age population, at just 13 percent. Six of the seven ballot groups where Proposition 16 garnered less support than the city average had a higher share of voting-age white residents than the neighborhood and the city overall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hollywood stars and industry leaders have split on Caruso and Bass, with each candidate collecting endorsements from a number of <a href="https://variety.com/2022/politics/news/los-angeles-mayor-hollywood-karen-bass-rick-caruso-1235215269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big names</a>, and given the liberal but not <em>too </em>liberal voters of Tinseltown, it seems as though this neighborhood could go either way.   </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This fairly expansive political neighborhood lies closer to the city’s denser urban center compared with the Outer Suburbs (our final political neighborhood, and the most conservative). Propositions 15, 16 and 21 all passed here, unlike in the Outer Suburbs, but by the smallest margins among the city’s political neighborhoods. With the Asian and Black voting-age populations together totaling less than 15 percent, it’s predominantly white and Hispanic. Five ballot groups are majority Hispanic, five are majority white and the remaining five are more diverse.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Inner Suburbs’ support for more local rent control was driven primarily by five majority-Hispanic ballot groups. The five majority-white ballot groups, meanwhile, brought down the region’s support for raising nonresidential property taxes, voting 52 percent in favor versus the rest of the neighborhood’s 56 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Caruso owns a home in this neighborhood, as do a handful of his <a href="https://variety.com/2022/politics/news/los-angeles-mayor-hollywood-karen-bass-rick-caruso-1235215269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrity endorsers</a>, such as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2021-09-22/scooter-braun-spends-65-million-on-a-striking-brentwood-mansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record executive and Taylor Swift archrival Scooter Braun</a>. Still, the liberal-leaning tendencies of this group, particularly on issues related to housing and funding, indicate that Bass could find a foothold. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That this neighborhood is the most hesitant to commit to wealth redistribution and racial equity isn’t surprising when you consider its proximity to two of the historically conservative regions in the state: Orange County and northern L.A. County. The Outer Suburbs supported the reclassification of gig workers as contractors with a city-high 59 percent of the vote. Increasing funding for anti-incarceration programs squeaked by on the narrowest of margins, attracting 51 percent of the vote — 14 points lower than the city average.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The averages disguise some geographic divides. The San Fernando Valley itself is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-25/no-longer-the-older-whiter-valley-whom-do-these-suburban-voters-want-for-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politically and demographically diverse</a>, but as it nears the San Joaquin Valley to the north, wealthier communities like Woodland Hills and Chatsworth begin to tack right. And down south, the historically industrial Harbor communities and the “Shoestring Strip” are a little less conservative than their northern counterparts: Three of the four ballot groups voted in support of Measure J, compared with just four of the 12 comprising the political neighborhood’s northern reaches, and two voted in favor of Proposition 15.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Bass has made efforts to reach out to this political neighborhood, it’s reasonable to think that, given its support for Lacey two years ago, Caruso’s tough-on-crime messaging will resonate here. </p>

		</aside><hr><p data-paragraph="main">The partisan affiliation of the next mayor of L.A. seems clear, but the nature of his or her coalition is not. Los Angeles faces the same internal tensions as many other American cities: longstanding racial inequities, a population sensitive to rising crime and a housing crisis crushing residents, particularly those with lower incomes. Resolving those tensions will be more difficult than the city’s deep-blue hue might indicate. With relatively little agreement on what L.A. ought to do about these challenges, the next mayor will have to convince skeptical neighborhoods that his or her vision is the right one. </p>

<p>Just How Far Apart Are The Two Parties On Gun Control?</p>
<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/ryan-best/">Ryan Best</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/mary-radcliffe/">Mary Radcliffe</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/kaleigh-rogers/">Kaleigh Rogers</a></p>
<p>After what feels like a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/cities-us-rocked-memorial-day-weekend-shootings/story?id=85083526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relentless</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/reported-mass-shooting-upstate-york-tops-supermarket/story?id=84721175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequence</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/upshot/gun-control-polling-votes.html?smid=tw-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile</a> mass <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-elementary-school-reports-active-shooter-campus/story?id=84940951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shootings</a>, Americans are once again debating whether the country needs stronger regulations on guns. Many lawmakers and activists contend that, even in a country as bitterly polarized as the United States, some gun-control measures actually <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-fe72-d0c2-a9ae-ff7250f80000&amp;nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=0000014e-f115-dd93-ad7f-f91513e50001&amp;nlid=630318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attract wide support</a> — whether Americans actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/upshot/gun-control-polling-votes.html?smid=tw-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote for the measures they say they support</a> is another matter. However, when you compare specific questions by party response, there’s a gap.</p>
<p>Consider background checks. Morning Consult and Politico asked about this gun-control measure in March 2021. How do you think Republicans and Democrats responded?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” support requiring background checks for all gun purchasers?0%255075100</p>

<p>Guess</p>
<p>That’s pretty close to consensus, but already we can see that even broadly popular measures like background checks aren’t as appealing to some Republican voters as they are to Democratic voters. Let’s take a look at some other measures. In April 2021, the Pew Research Center asked about barring people with mental-health issues from buying guns. How do you think Republicans and Democrats responded?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” favor preventing people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s--gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center, April 5-11, 2021, among 5,109 adults</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>Again, we see a lot of agreement from both sides of the political spectrum. But this question was a little vague — what does it mean to prevent people from buying guns? And which mental illnesses should be included? An APM Research Lab survey on Extreme Risk Protection Orders tried to go deeper by asking about these so-called <a href="https://gunsandamerica.org/story/19/08/05/what-is-a-red-flag-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“red flag” laws</a>. These laws would allow family members, the police or certain other officials to seek an ERPO, a court order to temporarily take guns away from someone who may harm themselves or others. When asked whether they supported family-initiated ERPOs, how do you think Republicans and Democrats responded?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” support allowing a family member to seek a court order to temporarily take away guns if they feel a gun owner may harm themselves or others?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.apmresearchlab.org/gun-survey-red-flag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APM Research Lab, July 16-21, 2019, among 1,009 U.S. adult residents</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>Once again, a majority of both Democrats and Republicans support this kind of measure, though the gap is wider. When asked whether they would support the police initiating such an action, support dropped among both groups, to 78 percent among Democrats and 66 percent among Republicans.</p>
<p>How about a law banning assault weapons, something that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/understanding-1994-assault-weapons-ban-ended/story?id=65546858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress passed in 1994</a> (but let expire 10 years later) and an option that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-points-assault-weapons-ban-rational-option-gun-control-rcna31106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden recently promoted</a>?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” favor banning assault-style weapons?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s--gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center, April 5-11, 2021, among 5,109 adults</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>While Democratic support remains high, Republican support drops dramatically, even though the previous ban enjoyed some bipartisan support when it passed.</p>
<p>Another proposal that has <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/27/wisconsin-republicans-float-arming-teachers-after-school-shootings-robin-vos-kevin-nicholson/9944387002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been floated by politicians</a> is allowing teachers to carry weapons in school. How far apart do you think Republicans and Democrats are in supporting this measure?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” favor allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K-12 schools?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s--gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center, April 5-11, 2021, among 5,109 adults</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>While a majority of Republicans support this idea, it’s not nearly as popular with them as some other measures — and it’s clearly unpopular with Democrats.</p>
<p>But getting gun-control laws passed is not just about whether voters support certain measures but also about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-gun-debate-needs-to-break-old-patterns/2022/05/26/f3acfede-dcfc-11ec-bc35-a91d0a94923b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how passionate voters are that those measures will work</a>. If a voter generally supports a new law but doesn’t think it will actually change much, they may not be as active in supporting it. A 2019 poll by ABC News/The Washington Post asked about this:</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they were “very” or “somewhat” confident that passing stricter gun-control laws would reduce mass shootings in this country?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/sept-2-5-2019-washington-post-abc-news-poll/d4e18b36-79bf-492d-91e3-d1c7a49d37e2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC News/The Washington Post, Sept. 2-5, 2019, among 1,003 adults</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>However, when asked about improving mental-health monitoring and treatment, Republicans were much more confident that this would reduce mass shootings, even slightly more so than Democrats: 78 percent of Republicans said they were “very” or “somewhat” confident that this would work, and 75 percent of Democrats agreed.</p>
<p>Some differences in thinking about gun control may have to do with whether people own guns themselves.</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they, or anyone in their household, own a gun of any kind?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/03122949/2202079_crosstabs_MC_TECH_SMART_WEAPONRY_Adults.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult, Feb. 12-13, 2022, among 2,210 adults</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>Although most Americans don’t own a gun, a small share own a lot of them, which is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why the U.S. has more guns than people</a>.</p>
<p>While both Democrats and Republicans support some gun-control measures, broad support for extensive gun control is its own constitutional knot thanks to the Second Amendment. In April, YouGov/The Economist asked Americans which was more important: the right of people to own guns or protecting people from gun violence. (Respondents could also say if they thought both were equally important.)</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they believe the right of people to own guns is more important than protecting people from gun violence?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/ml5z8flkh2/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/The Economist, April 16-19, 2022, 1,500 U.S. adult citizens</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>While a plurality of Republicans (49 percent) said both are equally important and a majority of Democrats (57 percent) said protecting people from violence is more important, the difference is striking. As the country debates how to end mass shootings like the ones that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/15/1099008586/mass-shootings-us-2022-tally-number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happen in the U.S. every day</a>, this gap may be the most meaningful of all.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday we ran through <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-20-california-primary-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 20 key races to watch in California</a> today, but now we’re back with a preview of 16 key races in the six other states holding primaries today. And the big races headed into tonight are high-profile Republican primaries that could affect the GOP’s chances in a number of competitive House seats. Additionally, a number of incumbents from both parties face primary challenges in deep blue or red seats, and Democrats have a competitive Senate primary in Iowa. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s dig into the interesting primaries in Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, starting with the states whose polls close earliest today. And make sure to join us at 7:30 p.m. Eastern for our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a> of the results!</p>

Tom Malinowski of New Jersey was already in danger. Thanks to redistricting, his 7th District has shifted 7 percentage points to the right. <p>Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>New Jersey</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 3rd Congressional District, 4th Congressional District, 5th Congressional District, 7th Congressional District, 8th Congressional District, 10th Congressional District, 11th Congressional District<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When the tiebreaker on New Jersey’s redistricting commission <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/redistricing/after-closed-door-process-wallace-chooses-democratic-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose the Democrats’ congressional map</a> in December 2021, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new lines</a> boosted the survival chances for three of the state’s four vulnerable Democratic House incumbents. But <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/11/malinowski-suporters-redistricting-524098" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the odd-man out</a> was Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski, whose <strong>7th District</strong> in the affluent suburbs west of Newark shifted from D+4 to R+3, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> Even before redistricting, though, Malinowski was already in danger, having <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/malinowski-defeats-kean-in-close-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely survived</a> the 2020 general election. He’s also attracted scrutiny since then <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-malinowski-stock-trades-congress-transparency-new-jersey-2021-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for failing to disclose</a> hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock transactions. Tom Kean Jr., a former state Senate Minority Leader and Malinowski’s 2020 opponent, is now seeking a rematch, and he’s favored to win the Republican primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while Kean is the choice of the <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidate-type/young-gun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national GOP</a> and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/kean-wins-morris-gop-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local party committees</a>, his long legislative career and status as a scion of a <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2015/04/10_things_to_know_about_tom_kean.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-known New Jersey political family</a> has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/nyregion/nj-tom-kean-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracted opposition</a> from his right. Kean’s main opponents are former evangelical pastor Phil Rizzo, state Assemblyman Erik Peterson and businessman John Henry Iseman, all of whom garnered some support at county conventions ahead of the primary. Rizzo is Kean’s most notable foe, having attracted attention as a <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/rizzo-raises-160k-significantly-trailing-keans-and-malinowskis-q1-totals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proponent for former President Donald Trump</a> in his <a href="https://nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/election-results/2021/2021-official-primary-results-governor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-place</a> performance in the 2021 GOP primary for governor. But it doesn’t seem that Rizzo’s “America First” message has put Kean in much danger, as Rizzo <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NJ/07/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised roughly one-tenth</a> of what Kean has ($228,000 versus $2.2 million). And with the five other candidates mostly <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2022/05/kean-could-win-democratic-held-nj-house-seat-this-fall-first-he-faces-trump-friendly-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressing similar themes</a> as Rizzo, the potential anti-Kean bloc of voters will probably fail to coalesce around one candidate, which should make Kean a strong favorite to win today.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Primaries will also decide the GOP challengers for the three potentially vulnerable Democratic incumbents who benefited from the new map. The <strong>5th District</strong> along the state’s northern border shifted from even to D+7, which could help Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer withstand the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP-leaning national political environment</a>. Viewed as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most moderate Democrats</a> in Congress, Gottheimer is also a top fundraiser as he had $13.4 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6NJ05171/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the bank as of May 18</a>. Gottheimer’s GOP opponent will most likely be Marine veteran Nick De Gregorio, who <a href="https://www.njpp.org/publications/report/does-the-county-line-matter-an-analysis-of-new-jerseys-2020-primary-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the support</a> of the local Republican organization in Bergen County, which makes up most of the district’s population. (New Jersey’s party organizations <a href="https://jpia.princeton.edu/news/how-new-jersey-political-parties-rig-ballot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are very powerful</a>, as their endorsement gives a candidate the “<a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=112633" target="_blank" rel="noopener">county line</a>” on primary ballots, which ensures prominent placement on the ballot and <a href="https://www.njpp.org/publications/report/does-the-county-line-matter-an-analysis-of-new-jerseys-2020-primary-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually ensures victory</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">De Gregorio <a href="https://www.insidernj.com/pallotta-v-de-gregorio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has argued</a> his military experience and outsider background make him the GOP’s best bet to defeat Gottheimer, but he first has to get past former banker Frank Pallotta, who lost to Gottheimer by 7.5 points in 2020. However, that shouldn’t be a problem as De Gregorio <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NJ05311/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has outraised</a> Pallotta $837,000 to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NJ05174/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$310,000</a>, despite Pallotta’s past support <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/trump-endorses-pallotta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Trump in 2020</a>. Democrats seem to agree that De Gregorio is the stronger Republican, <a href="https://savejersey.com/2022/05/gottheimer-opens-his-warchest-to-attack-pallotta-or-boost-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeing as Gottheimer</a> and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/de-gregorio-outraising-outspending-sluggish-pallotta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his allies</a> have sent mailings to Republican voters attacking Pallotta as being too Trump-like in a not-so-subtle attempt to get them to back Pallotta instead of De Gregorio.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door to Gottheimer in the North Jersey suburbs, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s <strong>11th District</strong> also moved to the left in redistricting, going from D+1 to D+11. This has made Sherrill, another strong fundraiser (she’s got <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NJ11142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5.6 million in the bank</a>), more of a reach target for Republicans. Her most likely GOP opponent is Morris County Commissioner Tayfun Selen, <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/essex-gop-backs-selen-for-congress-in-nj-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has the backing</a> of the party committees in Morris and Essex counties, which contain most GOP primary voters in the district. However, former assistant Passaic County Prosecutor Paul DeGroot has that county organization’s backing, and the two candidates have raised similar amounts, with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NJ11178/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selen bringing in $256,000</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NJ11186/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeGroot $244,000</a>. That said, DeGroot has self-funded most of his campaign and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/republicans-barely-raising-any-money-in-race-to-challenge-sherrill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely raised anything</a> in the pre-primary fundraising period. Regardless, the GOP nominee here will need the environment to be especially favorable to defeat Sherrill, but that isn’t out of the question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No incumbent got more help in redistricting than Democratic Rep. Andy Kim, whose <strong>3rd District</strong> in South Jersey swung 14 points to the left, from R+5 to D+9. Like Sherrill, this shift has made Kim more of a reach target for the GOP, but the leading GOP contender, Bob Healey, could prove a formidable foe. Healey owns a yacht construction company and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/healey-outraises-outspends-smith-by-wide-margin-in-nj-3-gop-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the backing</a> of every county GOP organization in the district. <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NJ/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He’s also raised</a> $1.2 million, including $260,000 out of his own pocket. His spending has dwarfed that of fellow Republican and gym owner Ian Smith, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NJ03282/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only raised</a> $154,000. But Smith <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2022/06/can-nj-gym-owner-turn-notoriety-into-a-victory-in-tuesdays-congressional-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did attract national attention</a> in 2020 for refusing to obey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s directive to temporarily close his gym to reduce the spread of COVID-19, <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/02/nj-gym-owner-at-odds-with-gov-murphy-to-speak-at-nations-top-conservative-activist-conference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even speaking</a> at the Conservative Political Action Conference last year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also three seats that are either safely in Democratic or Republican hands that are worth a quick glance, too. In the Jersey City-based <strong>8th District</strong>, Democratic Rep. Albio Sires is retiring, leaving behind a D+47 open seat. Democratic leaders <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2022/01/06/menendez-jr-formally-announces-candidacy-for-congress-in-new-jerseys-8th-district-1404323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have coalesced around</a> Port Authority Commissioner Robert Menendez Jr., the son of Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/nyregion/robert-menendez-jr-congress-albio-sires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represented this area</a> in the House before he moved to the Senate. <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/05/31/menendez-jr-eyes-congressional-seat-as-critics-cry-nepotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Despite charges of nepotism</a>, the younger Menendez has only attracted minor primary opposition, so he’ll likely be the district’s next representative. Meanwhile, next door in the Newark-based <strong>10th District</strong>, Democratic Rep. Donald Payne Jr. is likely to win renomination in a D+58 seat that’s about half Black. But progressive activist Imani Oakley <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NJ/10/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised almost half</a> as much money as the incumbent, $426,000 versus Payne’s $947,000 and is trying to run to his left. Still, Payne has a very liberal record, <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/payne-solid-progressive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making it difficult to paint him as too moderate</a>. <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/payne-has-6-1-cash-advantage-over-oakley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He also has the backing</a> of all local Democratic organizations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, redistricting shifted the South Jersey-based <strong>4th District</strong>, sharply to the right, from R+13 to R+28. This gave 21-term Republican Rep. Chris Smith a more conservative seat, which, on the one hand, was good news for Smith as it made his seat easier to defend in November. But on the other hand, it has also meant that he could attract a challenge from his right, but Smith’s intraparty opponents <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NJ/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t raised much money</a>, and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/gop-local-officials-nearly-unanimous-in-support-of-chris-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he maintains strong local party support</a>, so the thing to watch here is just how much of a protest vote he draws.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 4th Congressional District<br><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s only one race to keep a close eye on in Mississippi, and that is the GOP primary in the deep red <strong>4th District</strong> along the Gulf Coast. Six-term Republican Rep. Steven Palazzo has found himself in hot water since the Office of Congressional Ethics <a href="https://oce.house.gov/reports/investigations/oce-reportreferral-regarding-rep-steven-palazzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in late 2020</a> that there was “substantial reason to believe” Palazzo <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2020/11/25/steven-palazzo-ethics-investigation-is-the-congressmans-campaign-account-a-slush-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had misused campaign funds</a> for personal expenditures, a scandal that encouraged six primary challengers to jump into the race. And while they might end up splitting the anti-incumbent vote, that won’t help Palazzo much because Mississippi <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-runoffs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is one of seven states</a> that requires a candidate to win an outright majority to clinch a nomination. Should no candidate cross the 50 percent threshold, a runoff between the top two vote-getters will occur on June 28.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With no recent polling, it’s unclear how endangered Palazzo is, but his main opponents appear to be Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell, state Sen. Brice Wiggins and retired banker Clay Wagner. Each <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MS/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has brought in</a> at least $240,000, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0MS04120/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared with</a> Palazzo’s $598,000 (a weak figure for an incumbent), with Wagner <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MS04274/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised</a> $535,000 overall thanks to $300,000 in personal loans. All of the candidates running have criticized Palazzo for the campaign finance investigation and <a href="https://www.wjtv.com/news/politics/focused-on-politics/no-show-palazzo-congressman-still-under-investigation-absent-from-campaign-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for not attending candidate forums</a>, but Wiggins might have his own campaign finance troubles, as his state Senate campaign committee <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/05/18/brice-wiggins-congress-race-campaign-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has entirely funded</a> the pro-Wiggins super PAC spending in the congressional race, a potential violation of federal law. We should also mention that the challenger with the most cash is actually businessman Carl Boyanton, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0MS04161/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who loaned his own campaign</a> $550,000. But Boyanton only won 9 percent against Palazzo in the 2020 GOP primary, so one of the other Republicans is a better bet to force a runoff — or even defeat Palazzo.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1399664360-711.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1399664360-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1399664360-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1399664360-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>South Dakota Gov.

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> At-Large Congressional District, governor<br><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Barring any big surprises, both South Dakota’s lone representative and governor should easily cruise to renomination, but both incumbents face primary challenges from their right that are worth keeping an eye on. First, in the state’s <strong>At-Large District</strong>, Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson faces state Rep. Taffy Howard, <a href="https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/black-hills-lawmaker-taffy-howard-standing-in-way-of-dusty-johnsons-third-term-in-congress/article_9456515a-f808-5e2f-91e5-ab772454009a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has criticized</a> Johnson’s vote to certify the 2020 presidential election results. Howard, however, has <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/SD/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised just about $310,000</a>, which pales in comparison to Johnson’s $1.9 million. And a <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2022/05/incumbents-have-solid-support-republican-primary-and-south-dakotans-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May survey from South Dakota State University</a> found Johnson leading Howard 53 percent to 17 percent among likely GOP primary voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile in the primary for <strong>governor</strong>, Republican Gov. Kristi Noem faces an intraparty challenge from state Rep. Steven Haugaard. Haugaard <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2021/11/17/steve-haugaard-criticizes-kristi-noem-south-dakota-governor-primary-election-campaign-launch/8644867002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had criticized</a> Noem for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-south-dakota-legislation-kristi-noem-bills-59127fe856b9727300bd9264d9a38eff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetoing a bill</a> in 2021 that would have banned transgender girls from participating in high school sports, but Noem likely dulled conservative frustration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/04/noem-transgender-athlete-ban-south-dakota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by signing similar legislation into law in 2022</a>. Haugaard’s <a href="https://listen.sdpb.org/politics/2022-05-31/former-house-speaker-challenges-noem-for-governor-nomination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also tried to take</a> Noem to task for her flights on a state-owned plane to political events, which is <a href="https://www.keloland.com/news/local-news/government-accountability-board-moves-forward-on-gov-noem-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to a complaint</a> that’s before the state government accountability board. But Haugaard just hasn’t made inroads against Noem, who notably has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/593420-trump-endorses-noems-reelection-bid-in-south-dakota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>. That SDSU survey also found Noem well ahead, 61 percent to 17 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch: </strong>U.S. Senate, 3rd Congressional District<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the race for <strong>Senate</strong>, seven-term Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley is favored to win reelection in November. Nevertheless, Democrats do have a competitive primary between former Rep. Abby Finkenauer and retired Navy Admiral Michael Franken. On paper, Finkenauer looks like the favorite. Despite narrowly losing reelection in her former district in 2020, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/IA/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she’s outraised Franken</a> $3.7 million to $2.8 million, and she’s also acquired endorsements from high-profile organizations like <a href="https://www.emilyslist.org/news/entry/emilys-list-endorses-abby-finkenauer-for-u.s.-senate-in-iowa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMILY’s List</a>, the <a href="https://www.lcv.org/article/lcv-action-fund-announces-first-round-of-non-incumbent-senate-endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">League of Conservation Voters</a> and <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/campaigns-elections/finkenauer-picks-up-major-iowa-union-backing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organized labor groups</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Finkenauer only made the ballot after the <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/15/abby-finkenauer-democratic-senate-primary-2022-election-ballot-iowa-supreme-court-ruling/7313038001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa Supreme Court overturned</a> a lower-court decision that ruled she’d failed to qualify for the ballot, and Franken has actually outraised Finkenauer $2.4 million to $1.8 million in 2022. Moreover, a Franken campaign poll conducted by Change Research <a href="https://insideelections.com/Mike_Franken_Iowa_Poll_5-16-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found him running neck and neck</a> with Finkenauer in early May, a big shift from a 27-point deficit a month earlier. This finding, however, ran sharply counter to a <a href="https://abbyfinkenauer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/122/Abby-Finkenauer-Primary-Poll-Memo-April-7-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finkenauer-sponsored poll</a> from early April by GBAO that found her up 49 points. But Franken may indeed have gained ground, as <a href="https://www.insideelections.com/news/article/iowa-senate-franken-poll-tied-finkenauer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Elections reported</a> in mid-May that Franken had spent far more than Finkenauer on ads for TV and Facebook. This race looks genuinely uncertain heading into today, although the mission of unseating Grassley will remain a tall order for whoever wins come November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne will face a difficult reelection contest this fall in the <strong>3rd District</strong>, an R+2 seat that includes Des Moines. That’s why it will be important to see who wins the GOP primary today. And it’s shaping up <a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/political-news/2022-05-31/meet-the-three-republicans-hoping-to-ride-a-gop-wave-in-iowas-3rd-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be a two-way battle</a> between state Sen. Zach Nunn and financial planner Nicole Hasso. An Air Force veteran, Nunn has tried to promote his conservative accomplishments in the Iowa legislature, while Hasso, who is Black, has played up her outsider credentials and religious faith. Nunn held a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/IA/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slight fundraising edge</a> heading into the final stretch, as he’d raised $882,000 to Hasso’s $602,000 and had slightly more than twice as much cash on hand. But regardless of who wins, the GOP will have a real chance to capture this swingy seat in the fall. </p>

Michelle Lujan Grisham has led to a crowded Republican primary field. <p>Jim Weber / Santa Fe New Mexican via AP</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>New Mexico</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch: </strong>1st Congressional District, 2nd Congressional District, governor<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race for <strong>governor</strong> is the main event in the Land of Enchantment, where Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham could be vulnerable come November in this D+7 state. Public opinion appears to be pretty split on her, too, as a <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=06d0133e-5d47-4d4e-bf7b-a91519388b9e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KOB-TV/SurveyUSA poll</a> of registered voters released in early May found Lujan Grisham’s approval/disapproval rating at 48 percent/46 percent, similar to what <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/28/governor-approval-ratings-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult found</a> earlier this year. As a result, a crowded Republican primary field has developed, but there’s a clear favorite: Former meteorologist Mark Ronchetti, who lost the state’s 2020 U.S. Senate race by 6 points, running somewhat stronger than Trump did in New Mexico.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ronchetti leads in the polls and in fundraising over his primary opponents, who include state Rep. Rebecca Dow, retired Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Greg Zanetti and Sandoval County Commissioner Jay Block. Ronchetti <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/#/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $2.7 million, with Dow the next-closest at $1.5 million. Two recent surveys also put Ronchetti in the mid-40s, with no other candidate polling above 20 percent. In the <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=d97dbd57-3dab-41c3-af65-5829328b2eaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same KOB-TV/SurveyUSA poll</a>, Rochetti garnered 44 percent, 32 points ahead of Block, while the front-runner attracted 45 percent in a <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2501645/ronchetti-enjoys-big-lead-over-gop-rivals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mid-May survey</a> from Albuquerque Journal/Research &amp; Polling Inc., 28 points ahead of Dow. Looking ahead to the likely Lujan Grisham-Ronchetti general election matchup, the <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=4a522d37-094b-4138-b451-2a497f1da2bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KOB-TV/SurveyUSA poll found</a> the incumbent only up 4 points, 47 percent to 43 percent, indicative of how competitive the race could be.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in the <strong>2nd District</strong>, Republican Rep. Yvette Herrell will face a tough reelection fight in November after the state’s new, Democratic-drawn <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional map</a> shifted the southwestern New Mexico seat all the way from R+14 to D+4. Herrell’s November opponent will probably be Las Cruces City Councilor Gabe Vasquez, whom the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href="https://redtoblue.dccc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has named to its Red to Blue</a> candidate list running in seats the party hopes to flip. Vazquez <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NM02191/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $776,000 so far, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NM02217/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly outstripping</a> the $65,000 raised by physician Darshan Patel, the other Democrat in the primary. However unlikely, it’s still possible that Patel gives Vazquez a run for his money as he’s is running to Vasquez’s left to some extent. <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2022/06/02/nm-primary-election-2022-gabe-vasquez-darshan-patel-healthcare-gun-control/9969656002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patel supports Medicare for All</a> and, as the former president of a resident physician union, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NM02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has benefited from</a> $64,000 in outside spending by the Service Employees International Union (which <a href="https://www.cirseiu.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his union is affiliated with</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-new-mexico-1st-special-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a special election</a> in 2021 to represent the Alburquerque-based <strong>1st District</strong>, and while it’s a D+11 seat, a difficult environment for Democrats in 2022 could put it in Republicans’ range. The two Republicans in the race are retired police officer Michelle Garcia Holmes, who lost the 2020 election in this seat, and businessman Louie Sanchez, who co-owns an indoor shooting range. Garcia Holmes may have a slight upper hand in the primary contest, considering she has name recognition from her 2020 run. She also entered the final stretch of the race <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NM/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with about three times as much money</a> as Sanchez had, although Sanchez had raised slightly more overall. Without any polling, though, it’s tough to say which Republican will come out on top.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22145803554063-711.jpg" alt="Montana U.S. House candidate Ryan Zinke" width="840" height="560" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22145803554063-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22145803554063-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22145803554063-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Former Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke has raised over three times as much money as his nearest rival in the race for Montana’s 1st District. <p>Matthew Brown / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Montana</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st Congressional District<br><strong>Polls close: </strong>10 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the first time in three-plus decades, Montana will host two congressional elections after the census reapportionment process gave Montana back its second district, which it lost in the 1990 census. Republican Rep. Matt Rosendale is running in the safely red 2nd District (R+30), so the Montana race to watch is the <strong>1st District</strong>, an R+10 seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/montana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">located in the western third of the state</a>. This district leans Republican, but it could still be competitive in some years. For instance, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester would have <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::bd51aeae-2e06-43db-9cc4-b25e146dac22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried it by 10 points</a> in 2018, which was a Democratic-leaning environment. But in a GOP-leaning environment, the race will likely favor whomever Republicans pick today as their nominee. And that primary is mostly a question of whether Ryan Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior and Montana congressman, can win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having raised $2.9 million, Zinke <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H4MT01041/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holds a substantial monetary edge</a> over former state legislator Al Olszewski, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MT02084/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who’s raised</a> just $710,000, and businesswoman and pastor Mary Todd, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MT00112/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who’s raised</a> $448,000 (with $323,000 in self-funding). Zinke <a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2022-05-17/trump-endorses-ryan-zinke-during-a-tele-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also has Trump’s endorsement</a>. But <a href="https://flatheadbeacon.com/2022/04/27/congressional-gop-candidates-take-aim-at-zinke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the anti-establishment</a> Olszewksi and Todd might still attract support with their criticisms of GOP leaders in Congress and arguments that the 2020 election was stolen. Zinke’s critics have also seized on the amount of time he’s spent <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/10/08/ryan-zinke-congress-montana-santa-barbara-2022-514780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living in California</a>, and they’ve pointed to a <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/investigators-slap-zinke-on-candor-ethics-in-real-estate-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of the Interior report</a> published in February that concluded Zinke had behaved unethically while in the Cabinet by working on a land deal that involved a foundation he’d established. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Olszewski and Todd may end up splitting the anti-Zinke vote, making it easier for him to win the primary. Meanwhile on the Democratic side, public health expert Cora Neumann <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MT/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had almost four times as much money</a> in the bank as attorney Monical Tranel heading into the campaign’s home stretch, so she is the Democrats’ likeliest choice for the fall campaign, although this election cycle will likely prove to be an uphill slog for her.</p>
