			<title>Why It Was So Easy To Get Gavin Newsom’s Recall On The Ballot In California</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">California leads the nation in efforts to recall members of its government, but there’s no single reason for this — in fact, there are four. First, practically every public official in the state is eligible for recall. In addition, a recall petition can be triggered for any reason. California doesn’t require as many signatures as other states either, and it allows petitions to circulate longer. All these factors combine to make California’s recall process one of the most lenient in the country.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1416" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Gavin Newsom is the latest governor to face a recall attempt in the state, but he’s hardly the first. Everyone who has served as governor of California in the past 60 years has faced at least one attempted recall. But Newsom is part of a much more exclusive club with next Tuesday’s election: Qualifying a recall for the ballot is still rare, but California has seen more recalls of state legislators and governors qualify than any other state. Of the 29 recall elections for state legislators that have taken place in the U.S., nine have been in California, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials.aspx#Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>. And after Sept. 14, two of the nation’s four gubernatorial recall elections will have taken place in California.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The state’s recall procedure was enacted as a constitutional amendment over a century ago. As a Progressive Era reform, the recall — along with the initiative and the referendum, two hallmarks of California’s legislate-by-ballot system — was intended to strengthen the electorate’s power over its government. A California state senator was recalled in 1913, and with that, the recall was off to the races: There have been 178 subsequent attempts to recall elected state officials. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s been some futzing around the margins,<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, for example, Californians voted to increase the amount of time between the certification of signatures and the recall election itself from 60-80 days to up to 180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> but the basic mechanism for the recall of a statewide officer hasn’t changed much over the years. (Though state legislators <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SCA3https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SCA3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tried</a>, and are <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB660" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certainly</a> <a href="http://california%20leads%20the%20nation%20in%20efforts%20to%20recall%20members%20of%20its%20government,%20but%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20single%20reason%20for%20this%20--%20in%20fact,%20there%20are%20four.%20first,%20practically%20every%20public%20official%20in%20the%20state%20is%20eligible%20for%20recall.%20in%20addition,%20a%20recall%20petition%20can%20be%20triggered%20for%20any%20reason.%20california%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20require%20as%20many%20signatures%20as%20other%20states%20either,%20and%20it%20allows%20petitions%20to%20circulate%20longer.%20all%20these%20factors%20combine%20to%20make%20california%E2%80%99s%20recall%20process%20one%20of%20the%20most%20lenient%20in%20the%20country.%20insert%20chart%201%20gavin%20newsom%20is%20the%20latest%20governor%20to%20face%20a%20recall%20attempt%20in%20the%20state,%20but%20he%E2%80%99s%20hardly%20the%20first.%20everyone%20who%20has%20served%20as%20governor%20of%20california%20in%20the%20past%2060%20years%20has%20faced%20at%20least%20one%20attempted%20recall.%20though%20he%E2%80%99s%20part%20of%20a%20much%20more%20exclusive%20club%20with%20next%20tuesday%E2%80%99s%20election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still trying</a>.) Citizens bring a petition for recall to the secretary of state; they collect signatures; and if the number of certified signatures exceeds a minimum threshold, a recall election is triggered.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What makes California rife with recalls? First, all <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 states</a><a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, D.C. Recalling a mayor doesn’t count for the purposes of our story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> with official recall processes allow the recall of a governor, but only four — including California — hold nearly all public offices eligible for recall. Many states restrict recalls to include only elected positions or specific offices, or exclude certain judges from recall attempts. No public official serving the state of California is immune, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/us/politics/judge-persky-brock-turner-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful recall of Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky</a> in 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Secondly, California does not limit the grounds for recall. If, say, someone isn’t a fan of the state Supreme Court, that empowered resident could file 18 petitions to recall nine different justices in two years.<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This actually happened between 1986 and 1988. No petition successfully qualified for the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> With no required burden of proof, the first step to getting a recall on the ballot is as easy as filing some paperwork — unlike in some other states, which require an indictment or criminal conviction before a recall can even be considered.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="942" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-3.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Third, the state has a fairly low signature threshold. A petitioner seeking to recall a statewide official needs to collect signatures equal to 12 percent of the last vote for office (it’s a little higher for state legislators and judges), plus signatures equal to 1 percent of the last vote from at least five of California’s 58 counties. Compared with the other two states that require a geographic distribution of signatures, California’s threshold is relatively low. Georgia requires the recall position to have a minimum number of signatures from each of its 14 congressional districts, and Illinois requires signatures from at least 25 of its 102 counties.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">To trigger a recall election for Newsom, petitioners had to collect fewer than 1.5 million signatures, a drop in a state where more than 12.7 million people voted in the last gubernatorial election. Compare that with a state like Michigan, which would require signatures equivalent to 25 percent of the 4.3 million votes cast in 2018 to put a gubernatorial recall on its ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which brings us to the fourth reason it is comparatively easier for Californians to get a recall on the ballot. Out of the 19 states with recall processes, only four prescribe a circulation period longer than five months.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Alaska nor North Dakota has a mandatory circulation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> For statewide offices, California mandates a circulation period of 160 days;<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsom’s recall petition was extended an additional four months due to the impact of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> the majority of states limit that period to three months or less.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1014" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mithani-sweedler.RECALL-EASY-0910-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Yet California may not remain the nation’s most recall-friendly state for long. Talks of reforming the process have <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/article253864413.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked</a> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/06/californias-recall-is-a-blow-to-democratic-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up in</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/opinion/california-recall-election-newsom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent weeks</a>, with even former Gov.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">I was in my eighth grade classroom in a small town in Ontario, Canada, when suddenly there was a flurry of activity in the hallway. An instructor popped her head in the door, her face drained of color, and beckoned our teacher out of the room. Soon after, all of the seventh and eighth graders — deemed old enough to understand the gravity of the situation —  were ushered into a classroom where we watched a grainy broadcast of the news. The first plane had flown into the World Trade Center in New York City. We were sent home early. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are so few moments in history that call for the question “Where were you when you heard the news?” But the Sept. 11 attacks are undoubtedly one, and most Americans can answer that question without missing a beat. Earlier this month, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/hlzpfslijb/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov asked Americans if they could remember where they were,</a> and 81 percent said they could. In a separate poll, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/02/two-decades-later-the-enduring-legacy-of-9-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center found</a> that 93 percent of adults age 30 and over could remember. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past two decades, as pollsters have surveyed Americans on issues around terrorism and the 9/11 attacks in particular, much of the sentiment has remained consistent, a pattern identified in <a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2021-08/mueller-public-opinion-on-war-and-terror-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a white paper published in August</a> by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. In a review of public opinion polling since the 9/11 attacks, John Mueller, a senior fellow at Cato and a political scientist at Ohio State University, found that much of the public’s opinions about terrorism and safety have remained steady for two decades. In some cases, concerns spiked immediately following the attacks, then declined slightly before staying static for years. In other cases, the rates of concern never declined. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“These findings are rather surprising because there is reason to have expected that concerns and anxieties about terrorism would erode over time,” Mueller wrote. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/911-era-political-consensus-impossible-days-79884213</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">For example, Americans have remained convinced that a terrorist attack is likely. A series of polls from The Economist/YouGov conducted from 2013 to 2021<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouGov also posed this question in 2009. Also, four of the polls we analyzed were conducted by YouGov alone, without sponsorship of The Economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> asked what Americans think are the chances of a terrorist attack in the U.S. in the next 12 months. Those who thought an attack was “very” or “somewhat” likely rarely dipped below 50 percent and often spiked following major terrorist attacks in the U.S. or Europe. (Any time the responses rose about 70 percent, it was following a major attack.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, Pew’s annual survey of policy priorities has found <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/02/two-decades-later-the-enduring-legacy-of-9-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans rank terrorism</a> at or near the top of the list year over year. As recently as 2020, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/02/13/as-economic-concerns-recede-environmental-protection-rises-on-the-publics-policy-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74 percent of Americans</a> said defending against terrorism should be a top priority for the president and Congress, making it the number-one policy issue. Even in 2021, as the pandemic altered priorities, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/01/28/economy-and-covid-19-top-the-publics-policy-agenda-for-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63 percent of Americans</a> still rated terrorism as their top issue, making it fourth overall, behind the pandemic, the economy and jobs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans also consistently say that 9/11 has had a lasting impact on this country. In <a href="https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/f1bf1e6c-a24d-4d52-a616-e05e09e6ce62/note/4f0fba7c-bb95-420e-b30e-9ddfd9f526fd.#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post/ABC News polls</a> from 2001, 2002, 2011 and 2021, the proportion of Americans who said the attacks “changed this country in a lasting way” has never fallen below 83 percent,  with 86 percent saying so in a survey conducted within the past month. Notably, though, the feelings on whether this is a change for the better or worse has shifted: In 2002, 67 percent of Americans said that the 9/11 attacks changed America for the better. That number has declined since, with only 33 percent saying so in 2021. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That 9/11 still rests so heavily on our collective consciousness is no surprise. For those of us who lived through it, we just have to cast our minds back to that day. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Abortion rights remain top of mind for many Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/">in the wake of the Supreme Court</a> allowing a Texas law that effectively bans abortions in the state to go into effect. The percentage of Americans who say “abortion, contraception and equal pay”<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite the grouping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> are their top voting concern has risen since the decision, according to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/07/women-abortion-texas-law-top-issue/">a Morning Consult poll</a> from Sept. 4-6. Overall, 6 percent of voters said this was their top issue after the decision, compared with 4 percent before, while support among Democrats doubled, fueled by a 6-percentage-point jump among Democratic women.</li><li>Canada and Germany are heading to the polls to vote for new leaders and parliaments this month. In Germany, the center-left Social Democratic Party is leading the polls, sitting at an average of 25 percent, ahead of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party), at 21 percent, according to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/">Politico’s poll tracker</a>. And in Canada, the center-right Conservative Party has edged ahead of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party, with their respective polling averages at 33.5 percent and 31.6 percent, according to <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/">CBC’s poll tracker</a>. However, the Liberals are still favored to win the most seats — though another minority government is likely, regardless of who wins. </li><li>Though <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-end-of-the-afghanistan-war-and-bidens-handling-of-it-so-far/">Americans overall have somewhat mixed feelings</a> about the decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, when you ask Americans who were deployed in that war, there’s a higher level of consensus. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/09/afghanistan-war-veterans-polling/">An Aug. 17-Sept. 2 Morning Consult poll of veterans</a> of the war in Afghanistan found 58 percent supported President Biden’s decision to withdraw troops, with 53 percent still supporting the decision even if the Taliban is in control of Afghanistan, and 53 percent supporting even if it creates an opportunity for terrorists in Afghanistan. </li><li>The decision to get vaccinated against COVID-19 has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-arent-new-to-the-anti-vaxx-movement/">become an increasingly partisan</a> issue in the U.S., and it can sometimes make for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/03/08/vaccine-anti-vax-anti-vaxxer-what-change-their-mind-vaccine-hesitancy/3100216002/">some cognitive dissonance</a> between a person’s political identity and their personal health choices: <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/secret-vaxxers-these-americans-are-getting-covid-vaccinations-but-not-telling-anyone/">A Harris/USA Today</a> poll conducted between Aug. 27-29 found that 11 percent of vaccinated Americans said they would keep their vaccination a secret from some people, and 6 percent said they didn’t plan to tell anyone. Shy Trump voters are out. Shy vaxx-getters are in.</li><li>Lastly, it seems we’re all a bunch of thieves: <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2021/09/09/92f58/1">According to a YouGov poll</a> from Sept. 9, 58 percent of Americans take those tiny bottles of shampoo with them when they leave a hotel, including 35 percent who say they do so even if they did not open the bottle. Personally, I think that’s fine, but if you steal hotel towels, I’m judging you. Not because it’s morally wrong, but because why would you want a towel used by 5,000 other people?</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">At first glance, Melissa<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa is not her real name. She requested a pseudonym because she is concerned her beliefs will create backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> seems to meet all the criteria of the “crunchy granola” type. She tracks ingredients on all the products she buys and uses apps to identify anything that isn’t “clean.” She says she considers herself vaccine-hesitant.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m not against vaccines for everyone,” she wrote to me in a Facebook Messenger chat. “[But] I’m very distrustful of pharmaceutical companies and that is the main reason I am hesitant about vaccines for myself and my family.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But she’s not exactly left-wing. A nurse-midwife student in Nebraska, Melissa said she’s libertarian, and while there are ideas on the left and right she agrees with, her main political position is that “the government shouldn’t be regulating things that don’t hurt others.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The modern anti-vaccination movement in America has <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/06/the-anti-vax-movements-radical-shift-from-crunchy-granola-purists-to-far-right-crusaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often been associated</a> with a stereotype of left-wing, coastal, white, wealthy moms — those “crunchy granola” types. In recent years, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, spurred by low vaccination rates in children, emerged in wealthy, liberal places like <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/20/whooping-cough-cases-spike-again-in-marin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marin County, California</a>, and <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/some-families-make-controversial-decision-not-to-vaccinate-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boulder, Colorado</a>. But while the public narrative focused on these left-wing enclaves, they were far from the only regions affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease: <a href="https://khn.org/news/why-measles-hits-so-hard-within-n-y-orthodox-jewish-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conservative communities of Orthodox Jews</a>, some of whom also reject vaccines, have also seen spikes in cases, for example. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/Health/video/covid-19-vaccines-work-74654465</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And polls over the past two decades have consistently found Republicans are just as likely as Democrats to hold vaccine-hesitant views. So while the right-wing resistance to the COVID-19 vaccines may feel like an about-face for who is anti-vax in America, both sides of the political divide were always there — but now one side’s fringe views have slipped into its mainstream. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Vaccine refusal has always been a place where left meets right,” said Jennifer Reich, a sociology professor at the University of Colorado and the author of “Calling the Shots: Why Parents Reject Vaccines.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though anti-vaxxers have been around as long as vaccines, the modern anti-vaccination movement really emerged after the 1998 publication of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/lancet-retracts-mmr-paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an infamous and since-retracted study</a> in The Lancet that falsely claimed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine caused autism. In the years that followed — spurred partly by support from <a href="https://www.insider.com/jenny-mccarthy-became-the-face-of-the-anti-vaxx-movement-2019-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy</a> — a new era of vaccine fears began, with small but fierce <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/01/30/84-of-kindergartners-not-up-to-date-on-vaccines-at-a-marin-school-majority-of-students-unprotected-at-some-private-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cohorts of parents refusing to vaccinate</a> their children. And polling has consistently shown those small cohorts included Americans on the left and the right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take a series of polls from Gallup, conducted in 2001, 2015 and 2019. Each time, Gallup asked respondents the same questions about vaccines, and while there was always anti-vaccine representation across the political spectrum, the most recent poll showed a spike in the adoption of anti-vaccine views among Republicans and independents. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Republicans and independents are increasingly anti-vaxx" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/C63Yn/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="233" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">When asked how important it is that parents vaccinate their children, very few or no respondents said it was “not very” or “not at all” important in earlier surveys. But in 2019, 8 percent of Republicans, 8 percent of independents and 2 percent of Democrats said it was “not very” or “not at all” important that parents vaccinate their kids. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which side of the political aisle was <em>more</em> anti-vaccine really depends on the question and the poll. In <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/63g3p232e0/tabs_Vaccines_0716172013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2013 YouGov poll</a>, 11 percent of Democrats, 14 percent of independents and 9 percent of Republicans said they believe vaccines cause autism. But in <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/rat7jsde5z/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2017 YouGov poll</a>, 19 percent of Democrats, 31 percent of independents and 39 percent of Republicans said it was “definitely” or “probably” true that vaccines cause autism. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/02/09/83-percent-say-measles-vaccine-is-safe-for-healthy-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 Pew Research Center poll</a> found 9 percent of Democrats, 10 percent of independents and 5 percent of Republicans thought the MMR vaccine was unsafe. And in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-on-vaccines-and-the-measles-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2015 CBS poll</a>, when asked whether parents should be required to vaccinate their kids or should be able to decide for themselves, 38 percent of Republicans, 34 percent of independents and 23 percent of Democrats said parents should be able to make their own choice. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked about vaccine safety, Republicans and Democrats express vaccine-hesitant beliefs at roughly the same rate. But when asked about government mandates, Republicans are much more likely to take the vaccine-hesitant stance, according to Allan McCoy, a sociology professor at State University of New York. In a 2018 study published in Critical Public Health<em>, </em>McCoy compared two Pew Center surveys on vaccine beliefs. He found that the more ideologically extreme a respondent was — regardless of whether they’re on the left or right —  the more likely they were to think that vaccines are unsafe. But when asked if vaccines should be compulsory or left up to parents, respondents who identified as “very conservative” were 136 percent more likely than “moderates” to think it should be a parent’s choice, while those who were “liberal” and “very liberal”  were 44 percent and 13 percent <em>less</em> likely to think so, respectively. Democrats and Republicans are almost equally likely to hold anti-vaccine beliefs, but Republicans in particular <em>also</em> tend to be against vaccine mandates.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But if vaccine hesitancy before the pandemic was relatively bipartisan, vaccine hesitancy around the COVID-19 vaccine has been anything but. Polls and vaccination rates <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-is-growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have shown Republicans are less likely to be vaccinated</a>, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/03/05/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-plan-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-or-already-have/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to say they don’t plan to get the shot</a> than Democrats. Shana Kushner Gadarian, a political science professor at Syracuse University, and her colleagues have been conducting a panel survey of 3,000 Americans for the past 18 months. Gadarian told me there has been a partisan split on all health behaviors (not only the vaccine but also mask wearing, hand washing, visiting one’s doctor) throughout the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Partisanship is not the sole determinant, but it is the strongest, most consistent determinant, even controlling for age, education, where people are living, how many COVID-19 cases are in the area,” Gadarian said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This split over the COVID-19 vaccine reflects <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/17/politics-is-wrecking-americas-pandemic-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the politicization of the entire pandemic</a>, but what does it mean for the demographics of the anti-vaxx movement beyond COVID-19? Experts I spoke to said it’s too early to tell, and so far there hasn’t been enough recent polling on non-COVID-19 vaccine beliefs to be definitive. In <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/xj7rpmvws8/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July 2019 YouGov poll</a>, for instance, 14 percent of Democrats, 21 percent of independents and 28 percent of Republicans said it’s “definitely” or “probably” true that vaccines have been shown to cause autism. When YouGov <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/w2zmwpzsq0/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posed the same question this past July</a>, 11 percent of Democrats, 18 percent of independents and 27 percent of Republicans said so. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a chance some left-wing anti-vaxxers will second-guess their stance given the sudden embrace of anti-vaccine positions on the right. But Reich, who studied vaccine-hesitant parents for years, said they typically don’t identify as “anti-vaccine,” per se, and feel more strongly about their ideals — like that a parent is the best person to make decisions about their child’s health — than their identity. So having Republicans espousing similar beliefs won’t feel like a challenge for left-wing parents, necessarily. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, it’s possible that Republican resistance to the COVID-19 vaccine could mutate into vaccine hesitancy more generally, if one’s political identity demands resistance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m worried that the politicization could threaten the social consensus [currently] in favor of vaccination,” said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. “If we start to see attitudes towards vaccines become closely linked to partisanship and ideology, we could see a polarization over vaccination that would threaten herd immunity on a whole series of diseases over time.”  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From her point of view, Melissa said the idea that Republicans may become more broadly vaccine hesitant isn’t just a hypothesis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I know for a fact, based on a group chat I am in, that some Republicans are reevaluating their stance on all vaccines,” she wrote.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It didn’t take long for prominent voices on the political right to begin stoking fears about Afghan citizens fleeing the Taliban’s takeover of the country and coming to the United States.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/aug/25/how-are-afghan-refugees-being-vetted-heres-what-we/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaccurately</a> <a href="https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that there’s “NO VETTING” of these evacuees, <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-zuqbqd4mun579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking</a>, “How many terrorists will Joe Biden bring to America?” “Hillbilly Elegy” author and 2022 Ohio senatorial candidate J.D. Vance <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1429835612341874691" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similarly suggested</a> that the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/amid-afghanistan-chaos-refugee-vetting-process-sound-opinion/story?id=79689151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ostensibly insufficient</a> screening of Afghans would result in the U.S. harboring “a bunch of people who believe they should blow themselves up in a mall because someone looked at their wife the wrong way.” Afghan refugees have been frequently depicted as <a href="https://www.vox.com/22634047/afghanistan-refugees-tucker-carlson-housing-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic</a>, <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/stephen-miller-suggests-afghan-refugees-dont-deserve-to-come-to-us-may-not-be-pro-american-or-embrace-our-way-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ted-cruz-poor-vetting-afghanistan-refugees-invitation-terror-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national security</a> threats on Fox News too, with Tucker Carlson even branding efforts to relocate Afghan evacuees in the U.S. as “<a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/tucker-carlson-calls-effort-to-evacuate-afghan-refugees-to-u-s-operation-change-america-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Change America Forever</a>.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This fear-mongering is neither surprising nor new. There’s a <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/America_for_Americans/rI2LDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=refugee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long history</a> of politicians <a href="https://www.oecd.org/migration/refugees-are-not-a-burden-but-an-opportunity.htm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">erroneously representing</a> refugees as <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaq0883" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic burdens</a> who pose cultural and/or national security threats to the U.S. In fact, the same arguments against Afghan asylum seekers were also <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/06/15/482184991/fact-check-donald-trump-and-syrian-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed</a> in 2015 and 2016 against resettling Syrian refugees displaced by their country’s civil war. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump regularly railed against the refugee policies of then-President Barack Obama’s administration, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/21/full-text-donald-trumps-prepared-remarks-accepting-the-republican-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proclaiming</a> at the Republican National Convention, “We don’t want them in our country.” Trump’s administration made this point even clearer, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/38781496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning Syrian refugees</a> and cutting the total number of refugees allowed in the U.S. by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-politics-virus-outbreak-immigration-immigration-policy-1f8c91e31fba158126f8e91c1453b13f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 80 percent</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those policies reflect the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/u-s-public-seldom-has-welcomed-refugees-into-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically strong strain of anti-asylum sentiment</a> in American public opinion. Searching through the Roper Center’s database of <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/search?collection=LSM&amp;q=refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling questions on “refugees”</a> since the 1930s reveals that Americans have rarely supported asylum for forcibly displaced migrants seeking safe-haven in the U.S.<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one exception is when &lt;a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/study/31088773/questions#07cd6c18-15ce-4737-9f06-73f4127c39d9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;66 percent supported&lt;/a&gt; the Clinton administration’s decision to bring a relatively small number of ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo to the U.S. in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>30</sup></a> Nearly two-thirds <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/17/what-americans-thought-of-jewish-refugees-on-the-eve-of-world-war-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposed admitting 10,000 Jewish children</a> into the U.S., who were fleeing Nazism in 1939. Even after the horrors of the Holocaust were further exposed in the post-war period, only 27 percent of respondents in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wvckuwfe4w4b48x/gallup1946.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1946 Gallup poll</a> supported a proposed “plan to require each nation to take in a given number of Jewish and other European refugees,” compared with 59 percent who disapproved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The public’s opposition to resettling refugees in the U.S. persisted throughout the 20th century. Polling from the late 1970s, for example, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qyx0470zx9k3wu1/Gallup1979.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently</a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c99u50uf7p41kt3/NYT1979.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> that most Americans <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5tsb28nu2l49p9s/harris1977.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposed admitting thousands of refugees from Southeast Asia</a> in the Vietnam War’s aftermath. While support can vary by question-wording, majorities also opposed <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/llxyhtu7mv1m0bs/gallup1958.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepting Hungarian refugees in the 1950s</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cci2npz8wcybg79/nyt1980.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuban refugees in the 1980s</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hji7ymuomm2dqrl/nyt1994.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haitian refugees in the 1990s</a>. The same pattern once again emerged in 2015, when <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2015/11/bloomberg-poll-majority-of-americans-would-reject-syrian-refugees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/09/15/poll-results-syrian-refugee-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> that <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/09/14/few-americans-want-take-more-syrian-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few Americans wanted</a> to take in refugees escaping the civil war in Syria. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But public opinion on immigration issues has changed a lot since then. Americans generally became more supportive of immigration in <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/5/17527734/trump-immigration-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">response to the Trump administration’s restrictive policies</a> — a well-documented dynamic in U.S. politics where <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public opinion tends to move against the president’s positions</a>. As part of that overall shift, Americans’ views of refugees shifted in the same direction. Support for accepting Muslim refugees from Syria increased in The Economist/YouGovsurveys from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/o77ie8jgv3/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 percent in November 2015</a> to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/qs45iqlax3/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent in April 2017</a>. Quinnipiac University Poll showed a similar 12-point increase in support for admitting Syrian refugees over the same 16-month time period (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/20/poll-syrian-refugees-united-states-237406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43 percent to 55 percent respectively</a>); and the share of Americans saying the “U.S. has a responsibility to accept Syrian refugees” in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/02-16-17-Political-release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center polling</a> rose from 40 percent in October 2016 to 47 in February 2017. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/11/24/u-s-public-opinion-on-refugee-admission-is-more-favorable-than-current-immigration-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing public support for refugees in the Trump era</a> extended beyond the Syrian civil war. Indeed, the percentage of Americans who said that taking in civilian refugees who are trying to escape violence should be a very or somewhat important goal of U.S. immigration policy increased by double digits in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FT_19.11.12_immigration_topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew polls</a> fielded in December 2016 and September 2019 (61 percent to 72 percent, respectively). Meanwhile, the share of HuffPost/YouGov respondents who said “the U.S. does not have a responsibility to take in refugees fleeing from other countries” decreased from <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/syrian-refugee-poll_n_55f83d62e4b0c2077efc16c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent in 2015</a> to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vkgjbt5pv0/tabs_HP_Refugees_20190709.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42 percent in 2019</a>. And 2019 polls conducted by <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/264785/support-allowing-border-refugees-edges.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dnmp4n4fl2rc4wf/cnn2019.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-july-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> all showed majority support for accepting Central American refugees into the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The more welcoming context is one important reason why we’re now seeing stronger support for Afghan refugees than previous asylum seekers. Despite that high-profile fear-mongering, early polling on the issue shows relatively weak opposition to resettling Afghans in the U.S. The majority of voters in an August<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/25/afghanistan-withdrawal-relocation-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> supported relocating Afghan refugees in the U.S., while just one-third were opposed. Support was even stronger in the latest <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/aug-29-sept-1-2021-washington-post-abc-news-poll/899d77db-ef60-46c9-b028-8f3298df8659/?itid=lk_inline_manual_45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post/ABC News poll</a>, where 68 percent strongly or somewhat favored the U.S. taking in Afghan refugees after security screenings. And Americans are especially supportive of Afghans who helped U.S. forces during the 20-year war, with a whopping 81-percent of those surveyed by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJKdBglH8nPNslg4duYhtV1fuTcoWF4w/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/CBS News</a> saying we should help Afghans who worked with American troops come to the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That strong sense of obligation toward Afghans who’ve helped us has also sharply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/us/politics/republicans-afghan-refugees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divided Republican politicians</a>. While some of the loudest conservative voices in the country are now stoking fears of Afghan refugees, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/afghan-refugees-republicans/2021/08/18/3592aaa0-005e-11ec-825d-01701f9ded64_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republican politicians</a> have argued that we have a moral obligation to accept them into the U.S. — especially Afghans who directly helped American efforts over the past two decades. This includes <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-afghan-refugees_n_612d2b6ee4b0f562f3e128ef?l6q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several Republican governors</a> who’ve already agreed to accept Afghan refugees into their states.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The schism within the GOP makes it all the more difficult to mobilize public opinion against Afghan refugees. When party leaders are unified on an issue, their supporters <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo11644533.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to adopt those same positions</a>. But the mixed messages on this issue make it difficult to galvanize the same unified opposition that rank-and-file Republicans have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-views-on-immigration-are-shifting-even-further-to-the-right-under-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly shown toward President Biden’s other immigration policies</a>. This could change, of course, as moderate voices in the GOP have often been drowned out by the Trumpian wing of the party, and, as mentioned, public opinion tends to move against the president’s positions — it’s Biden, not Trump, in the White House now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But so long as several prominent Republicans feel obliged to accept Afghan evacuees, it will be harder for right-wing fear-mongering to change the country’s consistently strong support for Afghan refugees seeking asylum in the U.S.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It took <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/texas-gop-voting-cusp-governor-79749334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several months</a>, but Texas Republicans have finally enacted their much-debated bill rolling back voting access in the Lone Star State. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back in the spring, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/29/texas-voting-restrictions-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disagreements</a> between Senate and House Republicans delayed the final vote on the proposal until the last day of Texas’s regular legislative session, making it easy for Democrats to kill that bill by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/30/texas-voting-restrictions-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the capitol early that day</a>, since the Texas Legislature requires a two-thirds quorum in order to hold a vote. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott then <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/22/texas-greg-abbott-special-session/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called a special session</a> for July, in part specifically to pass the voting restrictions, but state House Democrats paralyzed it by fleeing the state in order to prevent the bill’s passage. However, Abbott simply <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/02/greg-abbott-texas-special-legislative-session/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called yet another special session</a> to start immediately after the first ended, and after nearly six weeks away, enough Democrats <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/18/texas-house-democrats-quorum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to the state</a> to allow legislative business to continue. The controversial elections bill <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/31/texas-republicans-dem-delays-election-508063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally passed</a> the legislature late last month — though not before a 15-hour talking filibuster in the Senate and an impassioned 12-hour debate in the House — and Abbott <a href="https://abc13.com/texas-politics-senate-bill-1-signed-into-law-when-does-sb1-start/11005841/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed it into law</a> on Tuesday. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Texas law is likely the culmination of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-states-where-efforts-to-restrict-voting-are-escalating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large-scale Republican push</a> to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-have-made-it-harder-to-vote-in-11-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrict voting access</a> this spring and summer — the policy byproduct of former President Donald Trump’s unfounded claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent. At this point in the year, most state legislatures are now <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/2021-state-legislative-session-calendar.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of session</a>, so we are close to being able to close the book on our tracking of these restrictions for 2021. Based on data from the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-voting-bills-tracker-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brennan Center for Justice</a> and the <a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voting Rights Lab</a> as well as our own research, we now count 52 new voting restrictions that have been enacted this year in 21 different states. And 41 of the 52 were sponsored primarily or entirely by Republicans.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1250" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-mejia.VOTING-RESTRICTIONS-2.0809.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-mejia.VOTING-RESTRICTIONS-2.0809.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-mejia.VOTING-RESTRICTIONS-2.0809.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rakich-mejia.VOTING-RESTRICTIONS-2.0809.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In total, state legislators proposed a whopping 581 voting-restriction bills this year — 89 percent of them sponsored by Republicans. Most (402) were rejected or failed to pass before a key deadline, but 42 of those passed at least one state-legislative chamber before dying, and another eight would have become law had they not been vetoed by their state’s (usually Democratic) governor.<a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One was vetoed by a Republican governor, Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, as &lt;a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/ducey-goes-on-veto-spree-demands-budget-passage/article_a92275d6-bfe5-11eb-9ca2-833e7aad09b7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;retribution&lt;/a&gt; for the legislature not sending him a budget on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>31</sup></a> And technically, 127 voting-restriction bills are still alive, including 20 that have passed at least one chamber. However, these bills are mostly either <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/23/michigan-house-republicans-pass-bills-enact-strict-voter-id-laws/5328162001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked by Democratic governors</a> or <a href="https://legiscan.com/OH/bill/HB294/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">languishing in committee</a> (putting them still quite far away from passage). So the number of voting restrictions enacted here in 2021 likely won’t rise very far, if at all, beyond 52.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even if nothing else passes, though, that is still a staggering number by historical standards. The Brennan Center for Justice has tracked the number of new voting restrictions enacted every year since 2011, and no year has even come close to 2021: The previous high was the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-law-changes-2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 voting restrictions</a> enacted in 2011,<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of October of that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>32</sup></a> the year after Republicans took full control of several state governments in the 2010 election. In <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2012-voting-laws-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years</a>, the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number</a> of <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new</a> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictions</a> has <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically</a> been in the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single</a> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digits</a>. (For example, 2020 saw only <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2020-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven new voting restrictions</a> become law.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The sheer number of bills — both enacted and proposed — really emphasizes what a big priority tightening election laws has become for the GOP since the 2020 election. But it’s also important to remember that a single law can contain numerous far-reaching voting restrictions. And as such, <strong>Texas</strong>’s <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB1/2021/X2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Bill 1</a> is probably the most comprehensive voting-restriction law passed since <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/05/06/gov-ron-desantis-signs-florida-voting-bill-in-front-of-trump-fan-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida’s SB 90</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/30/texas-voting-restrictions-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SB 1 requires</a> absentee voters to provide their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number on both their absentee-ballot application and absentee-ballot envelope; gives partisan poll watchers “free movement” around polling places; requires the secretary of state to check the voting rolls for noncitizens; and creates more paperwork for people who help other people fill out their ballots. It also bans specific ways of encouraging voting that were used by heavily Democratic counties, such as Harris, in last year’s election — including automatically mailing absentee-ballot applications to voters, drive-through voting and 24-hour early voting. The law does, however, include some provisions supported by Democrats, such as allowing voters to fix, or “cure,” mistakes on their absentee ballots and requiring training for poll watchers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here’s a summary of the other 27 voting restrictions that have become law since <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-have-made-it-harder-to-vote-in-11-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our last update</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Arizona</strong> enacted no fewer than five voting restrictions this year. The biggest outrage has centered on <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1485/2021">SB 1485</a>, which effectively ends the permanence of the state’s permanent absentee voting list by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/arizona-legislature-passes-law-purge-infrequent-mail-voters-n1267025">removing voters</a> who don’t cast an absentee ballot in two straight election cycles and don’t respond to a mailed notice. In addition, though, the state now <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1003/2021">requires</a> absentee ballots with missing signatures to be <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/gov-doug-ducey-signs-mail-in-ballot-signature-bill-amid-protest-over-voting-rights">cured by Election Day</a> (instead of giving voters a five-day grace period) and makes it a <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/HB2905/2021">felony</a> for election officials to <a href="https://grandcanyontimes.com/stories/605396122-arizona-passes-hb-2905-to-crack-down-on-voter-fraud-by-placing-restrictions-on-mail-in-ballots">mail an absentee ballot</a> to someone who hasn’t requested it. The state also has two new laws that appear to target Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs: <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/HB2794/2021">one</a> that prohibits election officials from <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/06/01/ducey-signs-bill-to-prohibit-changes-to-election-deadlines/">unilaterally changing election deadlines</a>, and <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/SB1819/2021">another</a> that gives the state attorney general (who is a Republican) <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/30/1011154122/arizona-republicans-strip-some-election-power-from-democratic-secretary-of-state">sole authority over election litigation</a> — but only until January 2023 (when Hobbs’s term ends).</li><li><strong>Iowa</strong> had already passed <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/08/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-shortening-early-voting-closing-polls-earlier-election-day/6869317002/">one major package</a> of voting restrictions this year, but it enacted a second one in June. <a href="https://legiscan.com/IA/bill/SF568/2021">This law</a> requires voters who cast provisional ballots because they lack ID to return with their ID by the end of the day in order for their ballot to count. The law also makes it more difficult to set up an early-voting site and imposes several restrictions on “delivery agents,” or people who help voters with disabilities: They must fill out a special form, they cannot deliver more than two ballots and they must drop off the ballots in person at election offices, showing ID to do so.</li><li>A <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/HB285/2021">new law</a> in <strong>Alabama</strong> <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/05/curbside-voting-ban-becomes-alabama-law-with-gov-kay-iveys-signature.html">bans curbside voting</a>, whereby disabled voters and those at heightened risk from COVID-19 can vote from their car outside a polling place. Two less controversial measures have also been added to the books: <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/HB314/2021">one</a> that purges voters from the rolls if the U.S. Postal Service indicates that they have changed addresses and if the voter does not return a pre-addressed card updating or confirming their address, and <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/HB538/2021">another</a> that moves up the deadline to request an absentee ballot by mail by two days (the deadline to request one in person remains the same).</li><li><strong>Montana</strong> now <a href="https://legiscan.com/MT/bill/HB530/2021">bans</a> people from being paid to deliver other people’s absentee ballots, a practice sometimes derided as “ballot harvesting.” Native American groups and the American Civil Liberties Union are now <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2021/05/18/montana-election-laws-challenged-in-court/">suing to overturn the law</a>, as well as a previous law eliminating same-day voter registration.</li><li><strong>Texas</strong> also passed four lower-profile voting restrictions: <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB1113/2021">one</a> that allows the secretary of state to withhold funding from local election offices that don’t purge voters from the rolls as required by state law; <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/HB3920/2021">one</a> that spells out certain excuses that are <em>not</em> valid reasons for requesting an absentee ballot; <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/HB574/2021">one</a> that makes it a felony for election officials to knowingly count “invalid” votes; and <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB1111/2021">one</a> that bans registering to vote at a P.O. box. (That last law is being <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/06/22/texas-voting-lawsuit-latino-republican-residency-bill/5307669001/">challenged in court</a>.)</li><li>Two <a href="https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/SB31/2021">new</a> <a href="https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB523/2021">laws</a> in <strong>New Hampshire</strong> permit election officials to purge voters from the rolls based on data provided by other states and require photographs to be taken of any voters who register on election day but fail to provide ID, respectively. </li><li>Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards of <strong>Louisiana</strong> has signed a <a href="https://legiscan.com/LA/bill/HB167/2021">bill</a> requiring election officials to search obituaries for registered voters and purge any deceased voters within 30 days.</li><li><strong>Idaho</strong> has enacted a <a href="https://legiscan.com/ID/bill/S1064/2021">new law</a> that prohibits voters from changing their mind about which party’s primary they want to vote in once they’ve been issued an absentee ballot.</li><li>In <strong>Utah</strong>, voters now <a href="https://legiscan.com/UT/bill/HB0197/2021">must</a> register with a political party by March 31 of an even year in order to vote in that party’s primary.</li><li>A <a href="https://legiscan.com/OH/bill/HB110/2021">major appropriations bill</a> in <strong>Ohio</strong> includes a provision that bars election officials from settling lawsuits in ways that contradict state election law.</li><li><strong>New York</strong> became the rare blue state to restrict voting access when it passed a <a href="https://legiscan.com/NY/bill/A07478/2021">law</a> that allows for fewer in-person polling places.</li><li>A sweeping election-administration <a href="https://legiscan.com/ND/bill/1253/2021">bill</a> in <strong>North Dakota </strong><a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/major-north-dakota-election-bill-clears-legislature/article_fe2621ec-4415-56e7-b741-122487900274.html">implements signature matching for absentee ballots and limits voters to 30 minutes</a> in the voting booth.</li><li><strong>Oklahoma</strong> <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/bill/HB2663/2021">moved up</a> its absentee-ballot request deadline so that voters now have eight fewer days to apply for an absentee ballot. <strong>New York</strong> <a href="https://legiscan.com/NY/bill/S00264/2021">did so</a> as well, but only for <em>mailed</em> absentee-ballot applications; voters can still request an absentee ballot in person as late as the day before the election. These laws actually <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2021/05/13/oklahoma-elections-gov-stitt-signs-bipartisan-bill-expand-early-voting/4971505001/">received broad support</a> from both Republicans and Democrats, as their intention was to avoid a situation where a voter requests an absentee ballot too late for it to arrive in time for the election. Nevertheless, they are still voting restrictions since they require people to plan significantly further in advance if they want to be mailed an absentee ballot, and the laws could still disenfranchise voters.</li><li>Similarly, the Democratic trifecta state of <strong>Nevada</strong> passed a flurry of election legislation this spring that had the overall effect of expanding voting access but nevertheless squeezed voters in two specific ways. First, as the flip side of the state’s switch to predominantly mail voting, <a href="https://legiscan.com/NV/bill/SB84/2021">one law</a> allowed for in-person polling places to be consolidated. <a href="https://legiscan.com/NV/bill/AB321/2021">Second</a>, as part of an effort to finish vote-counting sooner, mail ballots will have a bit less leeway to arrive late. Ballots must now arrive at election offices by the fourth day after the election, rather than the seventh day, in order to count.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, some of these election laws are more onerous than others. But overall, it’s clear that both the severity and quantity of voting restrictions has increased dramatically in 2021. While we don’t know whether these changes will actually <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-republican-push-to-restrict-voting-could-affect-our-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affect the outcomes of elections</a> (as many Democrats fear and <a href="https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/gwinnett-elections-boards-new-chairwoman-wants-limits-on-no-excuse-absentee-voting-voter-roll-review/article_7df1c274-5715-11eb-a31d-dfa23b30ec62.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least a few</a> Republicans hope), it will undoubtedly be harder to vote in 2022 in many states than it was in 2020.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>On Thursday, President Biden announced a new Labor Department rule <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/us/politics/biden-vaccine-plan-highlights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that would require</a> all employers with more than 100 employees to make sure workers get fully vaccinated or test negative for COVID-19 once a week. It’s the federal government’s most aggressive step yet toward a vaccine mandate, and it’s one that comes fraught with legal and political pushback. It’s not the first time the country has dabbled with stringent vaccine mandates, though. For decades, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states have required kids to get vaccinated</a> to go to school. That has its own complicated history, however, as Maggie Koerth wrote about before Biden made his announcement.</em></p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fall 2019, before anyone had ever heard of COVID-19, California legislators were trying to pass a bill aimed at increasing childhood vaccination. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-me-ln-essential-california-20190507-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five years previously</a>, someone at Disneyland had set off a measles outbreak that infected more than 100 people, mostly unvaccinated, in the state — as well as in six other states, Canada and Mexico. The incident galvanized legislators and led to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-measles-us-california-outbreak-vaccine-new-york-disneyland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of laws</a> aimed at curtailing the religious and philosophical exemptions that allowed parents to avoid getting their kids vaccinated before sending them to school. Take the exemptions away, the thinking went, and vaccine rates would rise. But the level of vitriol that enters politics when you try to mandate vaccines can be … intense.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The California Senate had to be evacuated because someone took — and this is more detail than you want — <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-02/vaccine-law-protester-blood-california-state-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a cup full of menstrual blood</a> and hurled it onto the Senate floor,” Alison Buttenheim, a professor of nursing and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, things are similarly tense. COVID-19 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/23/world/covid-delta-variant-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination requirements</a> are taking effect across the country. Universities are <a href="https://universitybusiness.com/state-by-state-look-at-colleges-requiring-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring students</a> to get vaccinated. Businesses are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/business/companies-vaccine-mandate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mandating vaccines</a> for employees and customers. <a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/covid-19-vaccine-mandate-for-virginia-state-employees-goes-into-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">States</a>, <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/honolulu-covid-19-vaccination-proof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cities</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-us-military-requirement-pentagon-3975940c732352f72e41f6e34a3a2669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the U.S. military</a> have made COVID-19 vaccination a must for <a href="https://katu.com/news/local/covid-19-vaccine-required-for-city-of-portland-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public employees</a>. But, as in California, the pushback has been fierce, with <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/570120-vaccine-mandate-opponents-protest-at-la-council-members-homes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-oak-lawn-woman-fake-vaccination-card-hawaii-20210901-ci3ndzqemzaajosv5v7nhfc5tu-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake vaccine cards</a> and <a href="https://www.nashp.org/state-lawmakers-submit-bills-to-ban-employer-vaccine-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outright bans on the mandates</a> in some states. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Simply enacting a law or regulation mandating vaccines isn’t enough. California ended up spending years cleaning up loopholes that parents used to get out of vaccinating their kids. The fact that the California legislature was still tinkering with the state’s vaccination laws in 2019 says a lot. To this day, the state medical board is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-24/vaccine-exemptions-medical-discipline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dealing with physicians</a> who were willing to write <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/2020/09/california-doctor-school-vaccination-exemptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thousands of bogus medical exemptions</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Mandates work. As the laws changed, <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/07/california-laws-tied-higher-kindergarten-vaccine-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination rates among California kindergarteners did go up</a>. But ideological values, deeply personal fears and (increasingly) political polarization all mean that a vaccine mandate isn’t just a switch you flip on and walk away from. Instead, a mandate is a finicky machine that has to be maintained, lest it fall apart. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">School entrance mandates are probably the single most effective thing we’ve done to achieve high vaccination rates in the United States, said <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/jc988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Colgrove</a>, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University. “Can you achieve it through voluntary means? No. Not really,” he told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mandates have focused on kids both because they are particularly at risk of severe illness and because schools are such a perfect incubator for transmission. Pack a bunch of people with no naturally acquired immunity into one building five days a week, add a child’s complete lack of boundaries and you’ve got disease soup.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But the country has long waxed and waned on whether to require kids to get vaccinated. School vaccine requirements have <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been with us a long time</a> — nearly as long as public schooling itself. Smallpox vaccination — the only vaccine that existed early in the history of public education — was required for entry into Boston public schools in 1827. But for much of American history, mandates were inconsistently applied across geography and tended to come and go over time. For example, Washington and Wisconsin ended school vaccination requirements in 1919 and 1920, respectively, and during the 1920s, the Utah and North Dakota legislatures passed laws forbidding compulsory vaccination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But mandates became more of a mainstay in the late 20th century, when a series of school-based measles outbreaks swept the nation in the 1970s — and it quickly became clear that vaccines could help. In Texarkana, a city split by the Texas-Arkansas border, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Walter-Orenstein/publication/6665779_The_Role_of_Measles_Elimination_in_Development_of_a_National_Immunization_Program/links/59da4b1faca272e6096be6a5/The-Role-of-Measles-Elimination-in-Development-of-a-National-Immunization-Program.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Arkansas side had a vaccine mandate and fared far better than the Texas side</a>, which had no mandate. By 1980, every state had some kind of compulsory vaccination for school-age children. Annual cases of measles dropped from tens of thousands in the 1970s to fewer than 2,000 by 1983. During the 20th century, measles infected an average of more than 500,000 Americans each year. In 2005, after decades of school vaccine mandates and vaccination rates higher than 90 percent, it infected 66 people. Vaccines reduced the spread of disease, and making the vaccines mandatory all but eliminated it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5007135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence like this</a> that gives public health experts solid reason to think requiring a COVID-19 vaccine — whether in workplaces, for school attendance or to go to places like restaurants — would boost vaccination rates and reduce illness in a way that purely voluntary vaccination campaigns just can’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not as easy as snapping your fingers and having everything work out. To get them right, vaccine mandates require compromise, tinkering and a lot of legal and political follow-up. COVID-19 mandates will almost certainly demand the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hanging over everything is the tradeoff between getting more people vaccinated and shutting out those who aren’t vaccinated. Douglas Diekema, the director of education for the Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics at Seattle Children’s Hospital, noted that anytime a government institutes a school-based mandate, they’re balancing two public goods: preventing disease and getting kids educated. “I think you need a good reason … to take that benefit away from people who won’t get vaccinated,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">COVID-19 vaccination requirements are bound to run into similar priority struggles. We, as a society, want more people vaccinated — we also want people to be employed and be able to go to college. And unlike the diseases that childhood vaccines have strongly curtailed, COVID-19 is an active pandemic. The choice isn’t just about “prevention” versus “access to societal services.” You have to factor in the health and lives of other people too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not everyone will make the same choices about how to balance access with safety. States have <a href="https://www.immunize.org/laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly different requirements</a> about how many vaccinations are required to go to school, and whether they’re <em>really</em> required. Some vaccines are required for school entry in every state — measles, polio, diphtheria — because they have extremely high efficacy rates and are related to diseases that spread through normal daily contact with other kids in schools. But only six states — plus New York City — require flu vaccines, which have lower efficacy. Only three states require vaccination for human papilloma virus — a disease that’s spread by sexual contact, and which has been heavily politicized by groups that framed it as giving preteens and teenagers adult approval to go have sex.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s likely COVID-19 vaccine requirements will remain a patchwork as well, said several experts I spoke with. Politicization and breakthrough cases are likely to mean the COVID-19 vaccine has more in common with the ones for HPV and flu than it does with the one for measles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even once you decide on rules, you have to decide on how staunchly to enforce them. In schools, all states allow medical exemptions because some children have immune disorders or specific allergies to vaccine ingredients. Forty-four states allow parents to exempt their children from vaccines because of religious beliefs, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/28/nearly-all-states-allow-religious-exemptions-for-vaccinations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a product of heavy lobbying</a> efforts by Christian Scientists during the 1970s. Other exemptions for vaguer “philosophical beliefs” — which 18 states now offer — evolved over time as a response to legal concerns about states favoring religion. Colgrove referred to all these exemptions as a “safety valve” — a way of accommodating the very small percentage of people who will never accept vaccination, without creating political standoffs or forcing children out of school.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The challenge for COVID-19 vaccines, as for childhood vaccines, will be in how to offer exemptions without making exemptions too easy to get. Several of the five researchers I spoke to told me that over the past decade a few states have dealt with the problem of childhood vaccination by tightening restrictions and providing better access to vaccines — making it logistically easier to get immunized than to get out of it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, there’s the question of what to do when some flout the rules. “This is not stuff that’s fun for anybody to enforce,” said Buttenheim. “In California, with public schools at least, the schools have a huge disincentive to exclude kids, because they don’t get paid. So excluding a kid for vaccination status loses you money as a school.” Nationwide, it’s not uncommon for schools to give parents time to catch up on mandated vaccines without kicking kids out — and sometimes once parents are granted extra time, schools don’t have the staffing resources to follow up, said Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at the Baylor College of Medicine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Creating a vaccine mandate — and enforcing it — is almost certainly going to require governments and institutions to come up with ways of dealing with loopholes and fraud. After the Disneyland outbreak in California, the state eliminated all nonmedical exemptions, becoming <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-04-28/connecticut-is-6th-state-to-end-religious-vaccine-exemption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of six states in total</a>. But the change didn’t mean a straight line to higher vaccination rates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There were suddenly a whole lot more medical exemptions,” Buttenheim told me. Medical exemptions <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/5/e20181051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased by 250 percent</a> over the next two years — with many of the exemptions being signed by a handful of doctors. Between 2016 and 2018, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-22/california-homeschool-strict-vaccination-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of unvaccinated kindergarteners being homeschooled quadrupled</a>. Making the mandate actually work has turned out to be a game of whack-a-mole, with legislators passing laws that specify which medical issues count as vaccine exemptions and establishing a surveillance system that approves exemptions and flags doctors for investigation if they’re handing out a lot of get-out-of-vaccine-free cards. While Buttenheim’s research suggests this has reduced and will continue to reduce the overall share of unvaccinated children in California, it takes a lot of work and resources to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7446529/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase vaccination rates by 1 percent, or even less</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The push for COVID-19 mandates could also have repercussions for other childhood vaccinations. Already, the Tennessee legislature has responded to COVID-19 vaccination by pressuring the state department of health to <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/07/13/tennessee-halts-all-vaccine-outreach-minors-not-just-covid-19/7928701002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop promoting <em>any </em>vaccine</a> to minors — including school-based vaccine clinics, something that research has shown is crucial for getting vaccines to kids whose parents might be comfortable with vaccines but who have budgets and work schedules or a lack of medical access that pushes vaccination down the family priority list. That’s on top of social disruption due to the pandemic itself, which has already <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7023a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced childhood vaccine uptake nationwide</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bottom line, according to the researchers I spoke with, is that vaccine mandates are a really powerful public health tool. They’re effective, the childhood vaccine mandates have been widely supported, and they’ve been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court. But that doesn’t mean they’re easy to implement. As Buttenheim put it: “It’s messy business.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">When she was hired as a professor by Harvard University in 2013, Lorgia García Peña was the only Black Latina on a tenure track in the university’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. But in 2019, she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/why-lorgia-garcia-pena-was-denied-tenure-at-harvard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was denied tenure</a> even though her department chair and two deans had told her that she should apply for early tenure. Her tenure committee also unanimously recommended she be promoted, and another committee above that endorsed its recommendation. About two years later, famed professor and public intellectual Cornel West announced that he, too, was leaving Harvard after the university <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/us/cornel-west-leaving-harvard-union.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to grant him tenure</a>. And of course, this spring we learned that Pulitzer Prize-winning, MacArthur Fellowship recipient Nikole Hannah-Jones <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/business/media/nikole-hannah-jones-unc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was denied tenure</a> by the board of trustees at the University of North Carolina — after the university’s journalism school had recruited her to become its Knight Chair in Race and Investigative Journalism. That decision was later reversed, but by that point, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/13/1015260330/nikole-hannah-jones-chose-howard-over-unc-hbcus-hope-its-the-start-of-a-new-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was too late</a> to convince her to stay.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These stories made headlines and sparked outrage, <a href="https://hussmanfaculty.medium.com/stunned-unc-hussman-schfaculty-statement-on-nikole-hannah-jones-6333c5f5d072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially among academics</a>, in part because they were some of the biggest “no-brainer” tenure cases — those three scholars are among the most famous and well-regarded in their respective fields. Denying them tenure is functionally equivalent to having MVP-caliber athletes on your roster but sending them to play for another team.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the other reason these cases sparked outrage is that they shined a light on a larger problem that lurks beneath the surface of academia. It’s a problem that academia — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-many-americans-dont-see-the-racial-wealth-gap/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the rest of American society</a> — doesn’t like to acknowledge: <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-13977-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academia has a problem with race</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is one of higher education’s most insidious secrets. Academia is a place where, to use the language of sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, there is <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442276239/Racism-without-Racists-Color-Blind-Racism-and-the-Persistence-of-Racial-Inequality-in-America-Fifth-Edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racism without racists</a>. By that, we mean that although most people prefer to think that they or their colleagues are <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/blindspot-mahzarin-r-banaji/1102334630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good people who would not intentionally discriminate</a>, there is plenty of evidence suggesting that racism plays an important role in the structure and function of academic institutions. It affects <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090952403000044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what gets researched and taught in courses</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/White-Logic-Methods-Racism-Methodology/dp/0742542815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">methods that are used</a> to conduct that research and the topic we will primarily focus on today: The people who are included — or excluded — from academic institutions <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-13977-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the first place</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/descendants-historic-black-leaders-share-legacies-78361733</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start by first looking at the demographics of academic institutions. The National Center for Education Statistics keeps detailed records of this in the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System</a> (IPEDS). That database provides demographic breakdowns of students and faculty who work at colleges and universities in the U.S., which can be compared to the demographic makeup of the overall U.S. population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the things you can see when looking at that database is that Black, Hispanic, American Indian and mutiracial faculty members are underrepresented in the faculty ranks, compared to not only their share of the U.S. population but also to the student bodies of colleges and universities. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="3640" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matias-lewis-hope-FACULTY-DIVERSITY-0907-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matias-lewis-hope-FACULTY-DIVERSITY-0907-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matias-lewis-hope-FACULTY-DIVERSITY-0907-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matias-lewis-hope-FACULTY-DIVERSITY-0907-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But those statistics, though troubling in their own right, actually mask a bigger issue, given how the American academic system is set up. The word “faculty” is an umbrella term that obscures some important hierarchical divisions, including the difference between tenure-track and tenured professors versus untenured professors. It’s a pretty important distinction, too. According to the <a href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Association of University Professors</a>, only 21 percent of faculty are tenured. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tenure is, admittedly, an unusual concept in most professions, but is an important feature of academia: Tenured positions are indefinite appointments that are designed to safeguard academic freedom. To use the language of the AAUP:</p>



<blockquote><p>“When faculty members can lose their positions because of their speech, publications or research findings, they cannot properly fulfill their core responsibilities to advance and transmit knowledge. Tenure provides the conditions for faculty to pursue research and innovation and draw evidence-based conclusions free from corporate or political pressure.”</p></blockquote>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, it protects faculty, like Hannah-Jones, when they pursue questions and projects (like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1619 project</a>) that political actors might find objectionable. The ability to pursue knowledge freely has been one of the hallmarks of our higher education system. It’s worth asking, then, who does — and does not — get the opportunity to hold those coveted tenure-track and tenured positions at America’s universities. The answer to that question is even more sobering than the statistics we just shared. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.provost.umich.edu/reports/Diversity%20Equity%20Inclusion%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over the past decade</a>, colleges and universities have been discussing the need to diversify their faculty: In particular, they’ve tried to increase the share of Black, Hispanic and Indigenous faculty members, all of whom have <a href="https://crge.umd.edu/underrepresented-minority-faculty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically been underrepresented</a> in the faculty ranks. Faculty diversity initiatives can be seen at universities around the country, including <a href="https://source.wustl.edu/2020/09/call-for-proposals-opens-for-race-and-ethnicity-cluster-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington University in St. Louis</a>, the <a href="https://www.as.virginia.edu/next-steps-arts-sciences-race-justice-equity-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Virginia</a> and the <a href="https://provostpostdoc.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Chicago</a>. But despite all of the talk about increasing diversity, it does not seem like universities have made much progress — at least when it comes to the diversity of the tenure-track and tenured faculty. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to the IPEDS database, underrepresented minority faculty (URM) comprised roughly 11 percent of tenure-track or tenured faculty in 2013 and increased to just 12 percent of tenure-track or tenured faculty in 2019. The numbers weren’t much better for universities looking to increase the gender diversity of their tenure-track or tenured faculty either. Over that same period of time, the share of tenure-track or tenured faculty who were women increased from roughly 41 percent to 43 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Why have colleges and universities struggled to diversify the upper ranks of their faculty even though they’ve publicly talked about increasing faculty diversity and in some cases even <a href="https://provost.wustl.edu/programs-initiatives/faculty-diversity/race-and-ethnicity-cluster-hire-initiative/#:~:text=Through%20the%20Race%20and%20Ethnicity,University%27s%20distinction%20in%20this%20area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed funding</a> toward faculty diversity initiatives? One of the biggest reasons is that many universities still struggle to <em>retain</em> the women and people of color they hire as part of those initiatives.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, at Cornell University, where two of us work, a recent <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/07/task-force-looks-move-needle-faculty-diversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">task-force report</a> on the university’s faculty diversity efforts noted that the university had hired 37 professors from URM backgrounds and 97 female professors from 2011 to 2018. But despite those hiring gains, the university also failed to retain 19 URM and 64 female professors during that same time period. These retention struggles help explain why Cornell, despite being the “<a href="https://brand.cornell.edu/messaging/founding-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any person, any study</a>” university, still has so few <a href="https://cornellsun.com/2021/07/02/i-dont-want-to-be-the-only-one-cornells-8-black-women-full-professors-face-disproportionate-burdens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black women who are tenured faculty</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are, of course, many reasons that faculty leave institutions. Sometimes they get better offers at other institutions. Other times they move for family or other personal reasons. But there is a third set of reasons that tie back to the examples we opened with: While many academic institutions <em>claim</em> to want to have a diverse faculty, many of them engage in practices that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221546.2021.1914494?forwardService=showFullText&amp;tokenAccess=EISWNKJAFQXJ6CZAZIH4&amp;tokenDomain=eprints&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;target=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;journalCode=uhej20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately push those faculty out</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, consider who gets to make the rules. Tenured scholars who, as we’ve noted, are mostly white and male, largely make the rules that determine who else can join the tenured ranks. This involves what sociologists call “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095325?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boundary work</a>,” or the practice of a group setting rules to determine who is good enough to join. And as such, many of the rules established around tenure over the years work really well for white scholars, but <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691617709590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t adequately capture</a> the contributions of scholars of color. For instance, getting tenure often requires some combination of demonstrating excellence in research (measured by publication metrics and funding) and teaching (measured by teaching evaluations). It turns out though, that the topics that scholars of color often research are <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw7238" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to receive research funding</a> and, at least in some fields, are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691620927709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to be included</a> in the very journals that are valued for promotion. Scholars of color are also <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/68/2/254/4958972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely than white scholars to be cited when their work is published</a>. And on the teaching front, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/exploring-bias-in-student-evaluations-gender-race-and-ethnicity/91670F6003965C5646680D314CF02FA4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women and people of color are often evaluated more poorly</a> than white men, even when they are teaching identical content.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What this all adds up to is that when colleges and universities invite scholars of color to join their ranks and increase the diversity of their faculty, they are inviting them to play a game that’s <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469627717/writtenunwritten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up for them to lose</a>. Faculty of color come to an institution looking to teach bright students and conduct innovative research. Instead, they often face hostile work environments where their intellectual contributions are undervalued. Even among the faculty of color who do earn tenure, negative experiences repeatedly <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221546.2021.1914494?forwardService=showFullText&amp;tokenAccess=EISWNKJAFQXJ6CZAZIH4&amp;tokenDomain=eprints&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;doi=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;target=10.1080%2F00221546.2021.1914494&amp;journalCode=uhej20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt them to search for jobs</a> at different institutions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This leads to an academic shuffle where universities convince the few tenured professors of color to change institutions instead of supporting more professors of color so that they get tenure. And some professors of color — both tenured and untenured — are leaving academia altogether. Inside Higher Ed reported earlier this year that <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/05/03/multiple-black-professors-have-resigned-recent-years-over-racism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of professors of color</a>, especially women of color, have left their universities, citing racism as a primary motivator. We saw this play out at UNC with Hannah-Jones’s tenure case, too, where at least five women of color who were full professors or administrators <a href="https://www.wunc.org/education/2021-06-21/time-faculty-color-explain-made-ready-leave-unc-chapel-hill-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left the university</a>.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, where do we go from here? Universities say they want to increase diversity among their faculty ranks, but as we’ve outlined in this article, they have very little to show for those intentions. Fortunately, many scholars of color have written extensively about <a href="https://www.diverseeducation.com/opinion/article/15091919/ten-ways-to-retain-faculty-of-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways to recruit and retain people of color</a> in academia. For instance, we know that higher education must be clear and transparent about the qualifications for tenure and apply the rules fairly. We also know that it’s not enough for universities to hire just a handful of faculty of color: They must hire enough professors to create a welcoming environment for scholars of color, especially in geographic regions that may not provide social support outside of university life. And perhaps most importantly, colleges and universities must value faculty of color beyond their contributions to achieving the diversity goals of the university. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Higher education cannot look to faculty of color to do the heavy lifting of racial equity work <em>and </em>do their jobs. Otherwise, as we see in the trends above, nothing will change.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">After more than a year of distance learning, many <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/schools-plan-potential-remote-learning-fall-75752218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school-age children</a> in the U.S. have gone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/us/schools-reopen-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back to the classroom</a>. And while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/covid-schools-delta-variant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highly transmissible delta variant</a> of the coronavirus certainly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/us/covid-school-reopening-virtual-learning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triggers mixed feelings</a> about kids’ returning to school, parents have maintained for the most part that they prefer in-person learning, at least some of the time, to the entirely remote, virtual learning <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/the-great-zoom-school-experiment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that took place largely online</a> during the past school year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The debate over whether students and educators must adhere to certain safety protocols to make in-person learning possible, though, is just the latest political battle concerning COVID-19. A week ago in Florida, a judge ruled that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/judge-florida-school-districts-impose-mask-mandates-rules-79681083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schools could<em> </em>mandate mask ordinances</a> despite Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’s objections. And on Monday, the U.S. Department of Education said it had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-education-dept-opens-investigations-5-states-regarding-bans-universal-masking-2021-08-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened civil rights investigations</a> into five states that banned schools’ mask mandates to examine whether these policies were placing students with disabilities and underlying health conditions at a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19. Recent surveys underscore just how large the divide is among parents over whether students and teachers should have to wear masks or be vaccinated — assuming, in the case of students, that they are old enough to get the jab. Much of that tension, though, may have less to do with how parents identify politically and more to do with whether they’ve been vaccinated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In February, before the <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/5-things-to-know-delta-variant-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delta variant had begun to spread</a>, support for in-person schooling was incredibly high. According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/336173/amid-pandemic-parents-support-person-school.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll</a> conducted that month, over three-quarters of parents of K-12 students (79 percent) said they supported “providing in-person schooling for elementary and secondary students” in their neighborhoods. Support cut across party lines, too: 94 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of independents and 62 percent of Democrats said they were in favor of in-person schooling. Since then, however, <a href="https://mercuryllc.app.box.com/s/e1xi9zesqukxq4ugrwrc6lzy3yv1ycvd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other polls</a> have shown that support among parents has dipped, although in-person and hybrid learning are still relatively popular options. Most parents just aren’t up for completely virtual learning, and even fewer support homeschooling, according to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/return-to-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> polling from late August. For the past six months, the pollster has asked parents of 5- to 18-year-olds what they believe the best model is for K-12 students this school year, and the latest numbers showed that 36 percent preferred in-person instruction only, while 37 percent wanted a hybrid model. Only 16 percent said they wanted entirely virtual learning, and just 7 percent said they wanted to homeschool their children.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Parents see less eye-to-eye, though, on which COVID-19 safety precautions to take in schools. Per an August survey from the <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/support-for-mask-and-vaccine-mandates-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>, 31 percent of unvaccinated adults versus 71 percent of vaccinated ones said they favored mask requirements for teachers. Those numbers barely budged when respondents were asked whether students should be required to wear masks: 29 percent of unvaccinated adults and 69 percent of vaccinated ones said face coverings should be mandatory for school-age children — many of whom are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/covid-vaccination-timeline-children/619729/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not yet old enough</a> to<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/covid-vaccination-timeline-children/619729/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> get the vaccine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support things like mask mandates</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/unvaccinated-america-in-5-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely overall to have received the jab</a>, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisanship-isnt-the-only-reason-why-so-many-americans-remain-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics alone doesn’t explain</a> everything we’re seeing here. For some school-safety precautions, the gaps are biggest between those who are vaccinated and those who are not. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">​The divide is especially pronounced when respondents were asked whether teachers and students should be required to get the vaccine. That same AP/NORC survey found a 54-percentage-point gap in the views between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults when they were asked about teachers — 74 percent to 20 percent, respectively, said they were in favor of the vaccine requirement for teachers. There was a similar 52-point difference on whether students 12 and older should have to get the jab: 70 percent of vaccinated adults said they should have to, compared with only 18 percent of unvaccinated adults who said the same. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the COVID-19 vaccine is not yet approved for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vaccines-kids-under-age-12-expected-mid-winter-fda-official-n1274057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">children younger than 12</a>, so the polling on parents’ support for vaccinating their children paints a muddled picture. The AP/NORC poll suggests that among vaccinated parents, support is very high, but other polls conducted earlier this summer show relatively low support. According to a May and June <a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/only-half-of-parents-plan-to-vaccinate-their-children-new-poll-finds/2021/08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education Next survey</a> of public opinion on education policy, just a bare majority of parents with a child in grades K-12 (51 percent) said they would “probably” or “definitely” vaccinate their child. Another 34 percent said they “probably” or “definitely” would not, while 15 percent said they didn’t know. (Parents’ vaccination status was not available.) And days before the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authorized the use of the Pfizer vaccine</a> for 12- to 15-year-olds, just 30 percent of parents with at least one child in that age range said they planned to get their kid vaccinated right away, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-april-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Family Foundation survey</a>. About a quarter (26 percent) said they first wanted to wait and see how the vaccine was working, while 23 percent said they would definitely not get their child vaccinated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/religious-vaccines-covid-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine hesitancy has decreased over time</a>, it’s possible we’ll see these numbers change, too. Prominent health care leaders <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fauci-backs-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-us-school-children-2021-08-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">touting the importance</a> of vaccinating children might also sway hesitant parents. But <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354203/parents-divided-mask-mandates-school.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> found<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354203/parents-divided-mask-mandates-school.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> in mid-August that parents of K-12 students were less likely than the general public to be worried about unvaccinated people. According to the poll, 51 percent of K-12 parents said they were “very” or “moderately” worried about people in their area choosing not to get vaccinated, compared with 60 percent of all adults who said the same. So, it’s also possible that the earlier trends we saw with hesitancy decreasing over time might not happen. We’ll just have to wait and see, too.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The Pentagon confirmed Monday that the U.S. had <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-defend-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-leaving-americans/story?id=79744273.If">pulled out the last of its troops in Afghanistan</a> and that the evacuation operation at Kabul’s international airport had ended. Recent polling suggests a majority of Americans support the troop withdrawal. According to a new survey by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/31/majority-of-u-s-public-favors-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-biden-criticized-for-his-handling-of-situation/">Pew Research Center</a>, 54 percent of adults said the decision to evacuate U.S. troops was the right thing to do, versus 42 percent who said it wasn’t. But this finding <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-declining-approval-rating-is-not-just-about-afghanistan/">doesn’t mean</a> they’re giving President Biden high marks for how he handled the end of the 20-year war. Per Pew, just over a quarter of respondents said the president had done an “excellent” or “good” job dealing with the situation in Afghanistan; about 3 in 10 said he had done “only fair,” and just over 4 in 10 said he had done a “poor” job. </li><li>The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine">fully approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine</a>, but that appears to be having a limited impact on vaccine-hesitant Americans. In fact, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/30/pfizer-approval-vaccine-hesitancy-polling/">Morning Consult</a> found that only 29 percent of unvaccinated adults were swayed by the FDA’s approval. A clear majority of unvaccinated Americans (61 percent) said they still didn’t plan to get the vaccine — something my colleagues and I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccine-hesitancy-is-still-strong-in-many-covid-19-battered-states/">wrote about earlier this week</a>. When unvaccinated Americans were asked why they were choosing not to get the jab, most (70 percent) said they were concerned about its potential side effects, though research shows that most are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/well/live/covid-vaccine-side-effects-faq.html">short-term and mild</a>. But side effects weren’t the only concern, as 61 percent told Morning Consult that they believed vaccine requirements were an infringement on their personal freedoms. That said, a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">survey from Axios-Ipsos</a> showed the share of vaccine-hesitant Americans was lower now than it had been since the pollster started asking the question this spring: Just 20 percent of Americans said they were “not very likely” or “not at all likely” to get a COVID-19 vaccine compared with 29 percent in April.</li><li>Since 2016, trust in national media has continued to decline, especially among Republicans, according to newly released polling from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/30/partisan-divides-in-media-trust-widen-driven-by-a-decline-among-republicans/">Pew</a>. Per the survey, the share of Republicans with at least some trust in the national media has plummeted from 70 percent to 35 percent over the past five years. Meanwhile, an overwhelming majority of Democrats (78 percent) said they had “a lot” or “some” trust in national media now — relatively unchanged since 2016, when trust among this group was at 83 percent. Meanwhile, <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/articles/local-news-is-more-trusted-than-national-news-but-that-could-change/">trust in local news</a> is higher among members of both parties. According to Pew, 84 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of Republicans said they had at least some trust in the information coming out of local news outlets now. </li><li>What’s the best decade for music? Your answer to that question likely depends on when you were born, according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/americans-favorite-decade-music">new polling from Ipsos</a>. Overall, a plurality of Americans (40 percent) said the ’80s had the best music, followed by the ’70s (37 percent) and the ’90s (32 percent). But these numbers vary heavily with age. Among Generation Zers, which Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/">defines</a> as those born from 1997 onward,<a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no true consensus on the year Gen Z ends and Generation Alpha begins, but Gen Z &lt;a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/family/story/gen-meet-gen-alpha-generation-born-2010-today-68971965"&gt;ends around 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>33</sup></a> 30 percent said the ’80s was the best decade for music, while the most popular choice was the 2000s, at 41 percent. Meanwhile, among Gen Xers, or those <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/">born between 1965 to 1980</a>, the ’80s was the most popular choice by far, at 61 percent; 51 percent of Baby Boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, said they preferred ’70s music. </li><li>Newly released <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/09/01/the-internet-and-the-pandemic/">polling from Pew</a> shows how beneficial the internet has been to Americans during the pandemic. According to the survey, 90 percent said the internet had been “essential” or “important” for them personally, and 81 percent said they had used video-calling services to connect with others since the early days of the pandemic in February 2020. Of course, being online all the time <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/">has its disadvantages</a>, too. A plurality of adults (40 percent) said they “often” or “sometimes” felt worn out from spending too much time on video calls, and another 33 percent said they’d attempted to cut back on the amount of time they’d been spending online. Moreover, for some, being online can’t replace face-to-face contact: 68 percent of adults said the internet was “useful” but that it couldn’t take the place of in-person contact. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval </strong></h2>

	</aside><p data-paragraph="main">Late Wednesday night in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/21a24_8759.pdf">5-4 decision</a>, the U.S. Supreme Court chose not to block a Texas law banning most abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy, making this the most restrictive abortion law in the country. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the law, but the law is now in effect, effectively prohibiting most abortions in the state. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses the legal debates currently playing out, what the court’s decision could mean for the future of Roe v.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In a matter of days, a novel abortion law in Texas has made it virtually impossible for women to access the procedure in the state — although the constitutional right to abortion is still intact, for now. The Texas law <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/18/texas-heartbeat-bill-abortions-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected</a>, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy. Eight other states have <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted to pass</a> similar bans, but the ban in Texas is the first to go into effect, after <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-awaits-supreme-court-move-restrictive-abortion-law/story?id=79742044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 order saying</a> that while it was not ruling one way or the other on the constitutionality of the law, it also wouldn’t pause the law while legal disputes unfolded in the lower courts because of the law’s unique structure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, women in Texas still theoretically have a right to an abortion — but almost none will be able to get one. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawyers for Texas clinics</a>, 85 to 90 percent of the abortions in the state happen after six weeks. Clinics across the state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are in chaos</a>, with overflowing waiting rooms and patients turned away in tears. At this point, it seems very likely that the law will remain in place until the legal battles are resolved, which could take months or years, making Texas into a bizarre test case — how will Americans respond when abortion is abruptly cut off in one of the nation’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/popest-nation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most populous states</a>? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to the polling we have now, the answer is far from clear. On the one hand, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority of Americans have consistently said</a> that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to abortion, should not be overturned. But many also <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support a wide range of specific restrictions on abortion</a>, some of which <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/874458692/supreme-court-hands-abortion-rights-a-victory-in-louisiana-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contradict the Supreme Court’s standards</a> for when and how states can regulate the procedure. That said, public opinion hasn’t really shifted on the issue even though abortion access has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-categorized-hundreds-of-abortion-restrictions-heres-why-the-anti-abortion-movement-is-escalating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily eroded in wide swaths of the country over the past 10 years</a>. But the fact that the Texas law directly attacks abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy — when the procedure is both most supported and most common — could galvanize public outrage in a way that past restrictions have not. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For decades, Americans have broadly opposed overturning Roe v. Wade — despite escalating attempts by anti-abortion advocates to turn public opinion against legal abortion. As the chart below shows, 58 percent of Americans were against overturning Roe when <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup last asked the question in May</a>, the same share who wanted to keep the case on the books back in 1989. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1108" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ATD.TEXAS-ABORTION.0902-3-update.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ATD.TEXAS-ABORTION.0902-3-update.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ATD.TEXAS-ABORTION.0902-3-update.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ATD.TEXAS-ABORTION.0902-3-update.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ attitudes on whether states should be able to restrict abortion are more muddled than their stances on Roe might suggest, though. In Roe and subsequent Supreme Court cases involving abortion, the justices have ruled that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/05/18/scotus-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states can’t ban abortion prior to viability</a>, which usually occurs around 24 weeks of pregnancy. Texas’s six-week ban is an obvious and dramatic departure from that standard. Some people, of course, have more extreme views on the issue: According to a Gallup poll conducted in May, 19 percent of Americans think abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, while almost twice as many (32 percent) think it should be legal in all circumstances. But most (48 percent) fall in between, saying it should be legal only under certain circumstances.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans support abortion, but not in all situations" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bj1eE/12/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="492" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">What should those circumstances be? That’s a surprisingly difficult question to answer -- in part because Americans are generally fuzzy on how specific restrictions actually affect abortion access. For instance, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, 69 percent of Americans supported requiring abortions to be performed solely by doctors with hospital admitting privileges, a restriction that has been <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/patient-support-advocacy/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-admitting-privilege" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly thrown out</a> by the Supreme Court for imposing too much of a burden on women seeking abortion. That could be good news for anti-abortion advocates, if it means that broad support for keeping Roe on the books doesn’t necessarily translate into opposition to specific abortion restrictions.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But this time, things could be different. Americans are much likelier to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/235469/trimesters-key-abortion-views.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support unrestricted abortion in the first trimester</a> of pregnancy. And that also happens to be when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most abortions occur</a>. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Support for abortion is highest in the first trimester" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OPBpP/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">So while Texas and other states have imposed plenty of other restrictions on abortion, this will cut off access significantly earlier than any other restriction since Roe was decided almost 50 years ago. And that’s the key distinction. Up until now, abortion restrictions have been fairly slow and piecemeal. But now women in Texas have lost access to abortion in most cases essentially overnight.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, the avalanche of abortion restrictions over the past decade have unquestionably made it much more difficult for women to get abortions in big chunks of the country, by making the procedure expensive and inconvenient for women to obtain -- not to mention hard for abortion providers to stay open. But while the slow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/31/us/abortion-clinics-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shuttering of clinics across the South and Midwest</a> has had a big personal cost for people across the country, that impact hasn’t really made its way into the headlines, in part because <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/18/number-of-abortions-us-drops-guttmacher-institute-study/2362316001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women have gone to great lengths</a> to obtain abortions despite the obstacles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, though, for the first time in decades, the country will get a glimpse of what happens when abortion is suddenly unavailable to nearly all women in one of the nation’s most populous states. For better or worse, Americans’ views on when abortion should be legal will probably get a lot clearer.</p>

But what does that illiberalism actually look like among elected members in Congress?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Quantifying politicians’ commitments to upholding democracy isn’t easy. Even defining “democracy” <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/conceptualizing-andmeasuring-democracy-a-new-approach/DAF249E74DDD3ACE3FFC96F20EE4074D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is complicated</a> — <a href="https://www.almendron.com/tribuna/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/conceptualizing-and-measuring-democracy-evaluating-alternative-indices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scholars disagree on its exact</a> definition — let alone trying to establish <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/b6/55/b6553f85-5c5d-45ec-be63-a48a2abe3f62/briefing_paper_9.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how closely politicians or parties</a> adhere to democratic principles. There’s no <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogowski/files/npat-paper-july2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing survey</a> of how strongly elected members of Congress believe in democratic principles, for instance, and it’s not clear what such a survey would even tell us, given that politicians (and their staffers) are often masters at spin. But just like aggregating <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Ideology-and-Congress-A-Political-Economic-History-of-Roll-Call-Voting/Poole/p/book/9781412806084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicians’ votes</a> can tell us something about where they fall ideologically on <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1057/pol.2014.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic or social policies,</a> one thing we <em>can</em> do is look at how members of Congress vote when issues of democracy are brought to the floor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the catch here is that matters of democracy are rarely brought for a floor vote. “Most aspects of democracy are not up for debate in Congress in any given year,” said <a href="https://sites.nd.edu/michael-coppedge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Coppedge</a>, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/en/global-team/principal-investigators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the principal investigators</a> at <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varieties of Democracy</a>. That’s an important caveat because the comprehensiveness of such a metric is limited by what Congress actually votes on. “There’s a lot that’s taken for granted that’s essential to what democracy is,” Coppedge said. “Instead, what we get our votes on [are] skirmishes on the periphery of what democracy means.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One more complication is that there is no single agreed-upon list of what are (or aren’t) issues of democracy. Never mind what the more-democratic position is on each issue. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-govern-winning-majority-threatens-democracy-77381725</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Bearing all of that in mind, I’ve built two different metrics to help us understand a legislator’s stance on democracy. First is a minimalist definition of democracy, limited to basic requirements like free and, in theory, fair elections and other measures that help safeguard democracy. Second is a more expansive definition, which contains everything in the first category, but also includes bills that expand civil liberties and who has political power. That way, we can see where politicians converge on these two metrics — and where they differ.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, the most bare-bones definition: “issues of <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/25/41/25418cbf-e680-4ec8-bede-b819587fb85d/structure_of_v-dem_v111.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electoral democracy</a>.” Included in this definition are the most basic requirements of any functioning democracy, like free elections and freedom of the press. And while most of these issues typically don’t come up for congressional votes, some did this year — most notably, the counting of electoral votes from Pennsylvania and Arizona in the 2020 election, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/6/22213979/congress-electoral-vote-count-pence-hawley-cruz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually a ceremonial event</a> that this year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/06/electoral-vote-update-congress-resumes-counting-after-pro-trump-rioters-invade-capitol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced objections from members of Congress</a> and coincided with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/electoral-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol</a>. Four other types of bills fall into this category: a bill that would have set up an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack;<a data-footnote-id="35" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-35" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3233" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;H.R. 3233&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000524897/senate-republicans-block-plan-for-independent-commission-on-jan-6-capitol-riot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when that failed to pass the Senate</a>, a bill to create a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol;<a data-footnote-id="36" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-36" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/503/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;House Res. 503&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>36</sup></a> a bill to increase the independence of government oversight of the executive branch;<a data-footnote-id="37" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-37" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2662" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;H.R. 2662&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>37</sup></a> and the second bill to impeach former President Donald Trump,<a data-footnote-id="38" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-38" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;House Res. 24&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>38</sup></a> as he was charged with inciting “an insurrection against the government of the United States.” We realize that bill was more political than the others in this category — and we did debate whether to include it — but ultimately we decided that being too political wasn’t a good reason for exclusion, especially as the bill did deal with a core democratic principle: the peaceful transfer of power in America’s elections. (For what it’s worth, including this vote did not meaningfully change the results.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">How politicians vote on these issues doesn’t just reflect the extent to which they back President Biden’s policies, which <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight tracks via its Biden Score metric</a>. Though party lines are important here, this stripped-down metric of democracy still shows substantial variation — particularly among Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="39" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-39" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We constructed our metric by taking the number of bills on which each politician supported the democratic position, divided by the total number of democracy bills they voted on. A present vote or abstention was treated as half a vote (that is, neither pro- nor anti-democratic), &lt;a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20151112_97-780_2008ca8ef8cc3fefe8088a36d9e020ec07463ada.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;except for the Speaker&lt;/a&gt;. To make sure the equal weighting of votes in this percentage metric wasn’t skewing results, we also conducted a slightly more sophisticated dimensionality-reduction technique called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;principal component analysis&lt;/a&gt;, but since those results were very similar to our more simple percentage-based metric, we’re sticking to the simpler metric for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>39</sup></a> On the other hand, Democrats are mostly clustered together in the upper-right hand corner.</p>

Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Bill Cassidy, Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse. All five of them opposed the objections to counting electoral votes in both Pennsylvania and Arizona and supported the National Commission to investigate Jan. 6 — all three of the pro-democracy bills the Senate voted on in this category, even though they differ quite a bit in the extent to which they support Biden’s agenda. Similarly, in the House, Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Tom Reed, John Katko, Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney all voted largely in favor of the pro-democracy measures in front of the House, even though Cheney rarely votes with Biden otherwise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other end of the spectrum, you can see which representatives have voted against both Biden and the bare-bones pro-democracy measures Congress has taken up. For instance, Sens. Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, Tommy Tuberville, Roger Marshall and Cindy Hyde-Smith have all voted against the democratic position every single time, even though Hyde-Smith tends to vote with Biden markedly more than the others. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But this bare-bones metric is, of course, a fairly narrow definition of what it means to live in a democracy, which is why I created a second metric that also includes bills that try to create a more expansive and inclusive democracy. Using legislative scorecards from organizations like <a href="https://www.aclu.org/scorecard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the government watchdog group <a href="https://democracyscorecard.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Cause</a> and the nonprofit research organization <a href="https://justfacts.votesmart.org/bills/NA/1/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vote Smart</a>, I looked at all of the other bills that Congress brought to the floor this year that could also be considered key to a functioning democracy, in addition to the ones I’ve already mentioned.<a data-footnote-id="40" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-40" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Vote Smart, I used votes that fell in their “Constitution” and “Civil Liberties and Civil Rights” categories.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>40</sup></a> Bills that fall into this second category include:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the Senate, it’s still Collins, Murkowski, Romney, Sasse, and Cassidy that lead Republicans on this metric — supporting almost all of the bills that fall in this second metric. The notable exception is the For the People Act, which no Senate Republican voted in favor of. Meanwhile, we saw more movement in the House, which voted on more “small-d” democratic bills and whose democracy score increasingly correlated with the Biden score. However, there were still some Republicans who supported a majority of these more expansive democratic positions, such as Fitzpatrick, Reed, Katko and Kinzinger, even though most of them vote with Biden less than half of the time. Cheney, however, fell on this more expansive metric in large part because she didn’t support legislation like a bill to prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, the For the People Act and the Washington, D.C. Admission Act.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this brings us to an important point. As this more expansive definition of democracy shows, many of these issues have become polarized by party. That can make it hard to disentangle anti-democratic politics from partisan politics, according to <a href="https://www.gretchenhelmke.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gretchen Helmke</a>, a professor at the University of Rochester and one of the founders of <a href="http://brightlinewatch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bright Line Watch</a>, a group of political scientists that monitors democracy and threats to it. H.R. 1, the For The People Act, is an instructive example: Democrats have pushed this bill as small-d democratic because it makes it easier for people to exercise their right to vote, but they also first <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/8/18253609/hr-1-pelosi-house-democrats-anti-corruption-mcconnell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced it in 2019 as a statement of what the party stood for</a>, when it had no chance of passing a Republican-controlled Senate and White House. So have Republicans voted against this bill as part of a stance against voting rights, or have they opposed it because they worry it delivers Democrats a sweeping legislative victory? There is no one answer here. In nearly every bill we looked at in the fuller metric, it was very hard to separate the politics from the policy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this metric is not based on a random subset of possible issues. Democrats, who currently control both houses of Congress, might be strategic in what they choose to move forward, political scientist <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jakegrumbach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Grumbach</a> noted. Grumbach, a professor of political science at the University of Washington and the author of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c682q88keqycp6s/grumbach_laboratories_of_democratic_backsliding.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent paper tracking the state of liberal democracy at the state level</a>, cautioned that Democrats might want to avoid difficult decisions for their members by introducing bills that could divide the party, leading them to keep bills off the floor on which the party doesn’t agree — <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111421" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a form of selection bias</a> that plagues <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/rollcall-vote-selection-implications-for-the-study-of-legislative-politics/FFAD60FB9CA9BBD54F02DE44A1FF0264" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all studies</a> of congressional voting behavior.<a data-footnote-id="42" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-42" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Joe Manchin, the most conservative Democratic senator, has a Biden score of 100 percent, meaning he votes with the president on every bill. This is &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not because he agrees with the rest of his party&lt;/a&gt; on everything, but because, in a 50-50 Senate, Manchin’s vote is crucial to any Democratic bill passing &amp;#8212; meaning that the Democratic leadership doesn’t even bring bills to the floor if he has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/06/joe-manchin-opposes-for-the-people-act-democrats-voting-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;signaled that he won’t support&lt;/a&gt; them. More generally, if a party has perfect information about its members’ preferences, it can &lt;a href="https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-my/wp-content/uploads/sites/349/2011/10/14093744/C_JOP2007.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;avoid losing a single congressional vote&lt;/a&gt;, since it will never bring votes to the floor on which it doesn’t have majority support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>42</sup></a> We should therefore be careful about drawing any conclusions about the liberal and illiberal tendencies of the elected officials in our sample.

<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, the core of democracy in the U.S. is not up for debate. “We’re fighting battles today over certain aspects of the democratic process, but not the core of it, for the most part,” Coppedge told me. But the fact that questions of democracy have become so clearly partisan is not good for the future of democracy. And given just how politically divided that fight has already become, it’s more important than ever to track how Congress votes on the matters of democracy that do make it to the floor.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">A lot has happened over the past month that had the potential to convince vaccine hesitant Americans to get the jab: More than 1,000 Americans are dying every day, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration fully approved one of the COVID-19 vaccines, and Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-republicans-have-changed-their-messaging-on-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-it-too-little-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been more emphatic</a> that everyone — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisanship-isnt-the-only-reason-why-so-many-americans-remain-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even their supporters</a> — needs to get vaccinated.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the effect has been mixed. Each month for the past four months, Morning Consult has asked Americans whether they’ve gotten the vaccine and, if not, whether they plan to. The most recent results show a notable dip in the number of vaccine-hesitant Americans — those who say they do not plan to get the vaccine, or are unsure if they ever will — in some hard-hit states, while others barely budged even as COVID-19 cases climbed and prominent Republicans promoted the vaccine during the same period when the poll was conducted (July 24 to August 23). Packed ICUs and Ron DeSantis speeches aren’t always enough to sway people who reject the vaccine. </p>

Now, the <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/453561-floridas-most-recent-covid-19-death-toll-continues-climbing-to-new-historic-worsts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average number of deaths per day</a> in the state is higher than at any other point of the ongoing pandemic. The day before Morning Consult’s most recent round of polling began, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/florida-covid-19-hospitalizations-jump-significantly-79024355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly promoted the vaccines</a>, saying that they are saving lives and <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2021/07/26/sellout-anti-vax-conservatives-come-for-desantis-1389008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended himself against pushback</a> from Republican anti-vaxxers who thought he was doing too much to tout the vaccine. Vaccination rates in the state did climb during this period: from early July to early August, <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/08/11/florida-vaccinations-climb-during-delta-surge-but-half-the-state-is-still-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of doses administered daily increased by 50 percent</a>, though they remain far below April’s peak. But according to the Morning Consult survey, from July to August the percentage of Floridians unsure if they wanted to receive the vaccine only decreased by 0.6 percentage points — less than the poll’s 1 percent margin of error. The number of vaccine refusers in the poll decreased by 1.2 percentage points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In South Carolina, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/south-carolina-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July and August also saw a cascade of new cases</a> that rival the state’s peak in January. Some state Republicans — <a href="https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/greenville/2021/08/19/greenville-gop-leader-pressley-stutts-dies-covid-19/5503881001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but not all</a> — have stressed vaccination. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has been promoting the vaccine <a href="https://www.abccolumbia.com/2020/12/21/senator-lindsey-graham-receives-covid-19-vaccine-over-the-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since he received his first dose</a> last year, doubling his efforts after he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-1ead5c0885acc7f3b2b648abc4c550f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested positive</a> for a breakthrough case in August. But vaccination rates increased only modestly here, <a href="https://www.wspa.com/news/top-stories/scs-vaccination-rate-increases-as-covid-cases-continue-to-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from a seven-day moving average of around 3,000 doses per day</a> at the start of July to 5,206 at the start of August. And like other southern states, South Carolina barely saw a change among vaccine-hesitant residents between July and August polls. The percent of South Carolinians who said they did not plan to get the vaccine dropped from 22.9 percent to 21.6 percent, while those who were unsure was essentially unchanged at 12.6 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, not all states with the highest COVID-19 rates are run entirely by the GOP. In Kentucky, where Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/02/1023925050/kentucky-governor-encourages-mask-use-and-vaccinations-as-delta-variant-spreads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has promoted vaccines and mask-wearing</a>, there also has been hardly any change in uncertainty and refusal rates over the last month despite <a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2021/08/13/wkyt-interactive-kentucky-sees-increase-vaccination-rates-covid-19-cases-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased vaccination rates</a> in some of the state’s counties that were previously lagging. In fact, from July to August, the number of vaccine refusers in the state essentially stayed the same. And more or less the same number of people in the state are unsure whether they want the vaccine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, some states registered more of a change, although significant pockets of resistance remain. Mississippi, which has one of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninashapiro/2021/07/10/mississippi-has-the-lowest-covid-19-vaccination-rate-but-the-highest-childhood-vaccination-rate-heres-why/?sh=1e59a92e19ab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country</a>, saw <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/19/mississippi-covid-worst-pandemic-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a record-breaking wave</a> of new cases in August. Some Republicans here, too, <a href="https://www.sunherald.com/news/coronavirus/article253469849.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began publicly touting</a> the vaccine over the last few weeks, such as state Sen. Jeremy England. England <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JeremyEnglandSenate/posts/1151559061999132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got his first dose of the vaccine in August</a>, and made several lengthy social media posts promoting the vaccine, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JeremyEnglandSenate/posts/1156677828153922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing that</a> “The verdict is out. The vaccine works.” Vaccination rates <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-mississippi-e6fabd2e331d8bf29efd623598b75929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticked up slightly</a> in July, and have remained steady since. Mississippi also saw a notable drop in the number of people who say they refuse to get the vaccine: 30 percent of Mississipians said they don’t plan to get the shot in the July poll, while 26 percent said so in the most recent poll. But that drop of 4 percentage points still means that more than one-quarter of the population is unwilling to get the jab. Meanwhile, the number of unsure Mississippians dropped less than 1 percentage point in the last month. The state’s Republican governor, Tate Reeves, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mississippi-governor-belief-eternal-life-reduces-fear-of-covid-19-2021-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Saturday</a> that people in his state were “less scared” of the virus because they believe in “eternal life.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Louisiana also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country and saw a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-sees-highest-spike-single-day-covid-hospitalizations-start-pandemic-n1275282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spike in single-day hospitalizations</a> in July. That month, Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards said the rise in cases and hospitalizations in the state was “scary” and <a href="https://twitter.com/LouisianaGov/status/1420076947799957516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly pushed residents</a> to get vaccinated. On top of that, Louisiana representative and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said that he had “<a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/national/coronavirus/republicans-amp-up-calls-for-americans-to-get-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high confidence</a>” in the vaccine — four days after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-republicans-have-changed-their-messaging-on-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-it-too-little-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he received the jab himself</a>. From then to now, however, there’s only been a “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccinations-states-infection-rates-d877547c26b0b3982c0d802339cd5219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little bump</a>” in vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy and refusal rates, however, have declined by a few percentage points: the number of people who said they wouldn’t get the vaccine dropped 4.3 percentage points over the last month, while the number of people who say they’re unsure if they want the jab dropped 0.6 percentage points. It’s possible that conditions in the state will worsen after Hurricane Ida ripped through Louisiana over the weekend. Edwards told the Associated Press on Sunday that over <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-ida-hospitals-5f68dc3f11842ad3b2effbc5d202ffb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,400 COVID-19 patients were in Louisiana hospitals</a>, many of which are grappling with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/hurricane-ida-live-updates-n1277879/ncrd1277940#liveBlogHeader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power outages</a> and <a href="https://www.wwltv.com/article/weather/ochsner-medical-center-hurricane-ida/289-f4ebe2ec-3eb9-4b23-ba35-d088d9ce0396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infrastructure damage</a> after the storm. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this again shows how getting vaccinated has become less of a public health issue and more of an identity and political one — if statements of support for vaccinations among political heavyweights in either party is moving the needle at all, it is doing so inconsistently. It seems there’s a certain bedrock of anti-vaccine Americans for whom no amount of new cases or political statements is convincing, and the rest of the public is left grappling with the consequences.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">With Democrats clinging to just an <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight-seat majority</a> in the House of Representatives, even a small number of defectors can hold up the party’s legislative agenda. That reality was on vivid display last week, when nine moderate Democrats <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-c2c1cfd80e7850d32d3387a9e1c05087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened to vote no</a> on moving forward with Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget resolution unless the House first voted to pass the Senate’s bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure package.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi eventually <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-08-24/house-senate-infrastructure-bill-moderates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck a deal with the bloc</a>, and the budget resolution passed on a party-line vote, but this will probably not be the last we hear of the “Moderate Nine.” So let’s get to know these fairly anonymous members of Congress a little bit better by exploring three key questions. First, do they have a long track record of moderation, or did their objection to the budget come as a surprise? Second, are they tacking toward the center for electoral reasons, or are they acting out of principle? And finally, might any of them be vulnerable to progressive primary challenges in 2022?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First of all, these were the members of Congress you would by and large expect to balk at ambitious progressive legislation. Eight of the nine are members of the <a href="https://bluedogcaucus-costa.house.gov/members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Dog Coalition</a>, a caucus of centrist Democrats. And they mostly have moderate voting records, too. According to the first dimension of <a href="https://voteview.com/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DW-Nominate</a>, which uses voting records to quantify the ideology of every member of Congress on a scale from 1 (most conservative) to -1 (most liberal), seven of the nine have ideology scores of -0.254 or closer to zero. That places them among the top 32 most conservative Democrats in the House. In fact, one of them — Rep. Jared Golden — is the single most conservative Democrat in the House according to DW-Nominate, with a score of -0.112. And Rep. Josh Gottheimer, the Moderate Nine’s unofficial ringleader, is the third-most conservative, with a score of -0.147.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps surprisingly, though, most of the Moderate Nine vote in line with President Biden’s position all or almost all of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden Score</a>. Five of them have voted with Biden 100 percent of the time, and three more have voted with him 97 percent of the time. Of course, this doesn’t reflect the headaches these members may cause behind the scenes for Biden and Pelosi — but it does reflect how they almost always vote with their party in the end, as they did on the budget resolution. (The fact that only eight House Democrats have Biden Scores below 97 percent also reflects how remarkably cohesive the Democratic caucus has been so far this Congress.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Golden is once again the outlier here, voting with Biden only 81 percent of the time — the lowest score not only among the Moderate Nine, but also among all House Democrats. This may partially be because Golden has strong electoral incentives to be a centrist: His Maine 2nd District has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="43" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-43" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>43</sup></a> of R+11, making it the most Republican-leaning district in the nation currently represented by a Democrat.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/bidens-approval-rating-fallen-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79388894</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, Golden is not the only Democrat representing inhospitable terrain. Several other members of the Moderate Nine also occupy competitive seats, including Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (R+4), Gottheimer (EVEN), Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D+2) and Rep. Kurt Schrader (D+4). So it’s likely that their objection to the budget was at least partially an attempt to burnish their moderate credentials for swing voters as well.<a data-footnote-id="44" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-44" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of their congressional districts will be redrawn in the next year as part of the &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;decennial redistricting process&lt;/a&gt;, but none of them should count on getting a free ride to reelection in 2022 regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>44</sup></a> This may be especially true of Gonzalez, who stands apart from the rest of the Moderate Nine with his -0.382 DW-Nominate score — smack dab in the middle of the Democratic caucus. Prior to 2020, Gonzalez’s Texas 15th District had been safely Democratic turf, but Biden surprisingly carried it by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-2020-2016-and-2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 2 percentage points</a>, and Gonzalez himself eked out only a <a href="https://results.texas-election.com/races" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-point win</a>. As a result, Gonzalez may have felt the need to adopt more moderate stances. Indeed, a Congress-by-Congress version of DW-Nominate finds that Gonzalez’s voting record has not been nearly as liberal here in 2021 as it was in 2019-20.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Electoral considerations don’t appear to be motivating the moderation of Reps. Ed Case, Jim Costa and Filemon Vela, however. Case and Costa both represent solidly Democratic districts, with partisan leans of D+32 and D+17, respectively; in other words, these two representatives could be much more progressive and still be in no danger of losing a general election. And while Vela’s Texas 34th District is, like Gonzalez’s, newly competitive (D+5), Vela announced back in March that he <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/03/22/filemon-vela-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not run for reelection</a>. So it seems likely that these three representatives genuinely believe in more of a centrist approach to governing. You might put Rep. Henry Cuellar in the same category, too: Although he’s running for reelection in a swing seat (D+4), his district (like Vela’s and Gonzalez’s) also zoomed to the right in the 2020 election. And Cuellar was known as <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/09/11/democrat-henry-cuellar-fundraising-republican-john-carter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most conservative Democrats in the House</a> even when his district was safely blue.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But regardless of their motivations, the Moderate Nine have drawn plenty of flak from their fellow Democrats; a coalition of progressive groups has even <a href="https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/568981-progressive-groups-target-moderate-dems-over-effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent six figures</a> on an ad campaign attacking them over their holdup of the budget. And while it’s still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rare for an incumbent to lose renomination</a>, some data suggests that some members of the Moderate Nine may be vulnerable to primary challenges if progressives decide to press their case. As occupants of safe blue seats, Case and Costa would seem like natural targets. In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders won <a href="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/CA-D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">41 percent of the vote</a> in Costa’s district in the 2020 presidential primary, and Costa himself won just <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2020-primary/sov/126-us-rep-congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58 percent of the votes cast for Democratic candidates</a> in the March 2020 top-two primary for his seat, suggesting his district has a not-insignificant appetite for more progressive politicians. For his part, Case was <a href="https://files.hawaii.gov/elections/files/results/2020/primary/histatewide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unopposed</a> in his 2020 primary, but he won only a <a href="https://files.hawaii.gov/elections/files/results/2018/primary/histatewide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent plurality</a> in the crowded 2018 primary, when his Hawaii 1st District was an open seat. And Case has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2HI02128/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than $100,000</a> for his 2022 reelection campaign so far.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cuellar is another prime candidate to lose his primary next year; in 2020, progressive attorney Jessica Cisneros held Cuellar to just a <a href="https://www.tpr.org/news/2020-03-04/henry-cuellar-narrowly-defeats-jessica-cisneros-in-tx-28-democratic-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent to 48 percent primary win</a>, and Cisneros has already announced she will <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/05/jessica-cisneros-henry-cuellar-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run again in 2022</a>. Bourdeaux might also be in for a tough fight: It’s a <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2021/05/04/ga-house-members-could-be-on-hot-seat-in-congressional-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distinct possibility</a> that the Republicans in charge of redistricting in her home state of Georgia will draw her and neighboring Rep. Lucy McBath together into a single safe blue district (in effort to reclaim a seat for themselves). Although Bourdeaux has already raised a hefty <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8GA07201/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> for 2022, McBath has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8GA06393/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more</a>. Bourdeaux is also a first-term representative who won her 2020 primary with only <a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/103613/web.255599/#/detail/30720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53 percent</a> of the vote, so she may not have had time yet to build up loyalty among local powerbrokers and voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are fewer signs, though, that the other four non-retiring moderates might be vulnerable in a primary. For instance, Gottheimer defeated progressive Arati Kreibich <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/assets/pdf/election-results/2020/2020-official-primary-results-us-house-amended-0826.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66 percent to 34 percent</a> in his 2020 primary, and he won’t be easy to take down next year either: One of the most prodigious fundraisers in Congress, Gottheimer took in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6NJ05171/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.9 million</a> in the first six months of 2021 and currently has more than $10 million in his campaign war chest. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the $3.5 trillion budget is hardly the last fight we can expect over the Democratic agenda in Congress this year, and with their success at getting Democratic leadership to negotiate with them, we can probably expect the Moderate Nine — and other representatives who fit these criteria — to continue to try to block (or at least influence) future legislation. Some may be acting with the intention of building credibility with swing voters, but their actions are not without risk as well: The more centrist notoriety they gain, the more likely they will be targeted in a Democratic primary. And of course, if Biden and the Democratic Congress are perceived as ineffective at governing, general-election voters might not distinguish between individual Democrats when they punish the party in November 2022.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In the past few weeks, President Biden’s job approval rating has dropped precipitously while his disapproval rating has risen sharply <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/biden-s-job-ratings-decline-amid-covid-surge-afghanistan-withdrawal-n1277368" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amid concerns</a> surrounding the delta variant of the coronavirus, the associated economic fallout from the pandemic and the ongoing withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just how much have things changed for Biden? A month ago, his approval rating stood at 52.7 percent and his disapproval rating sat at 42.7 percent, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>, for a net approval rating of +10.0 percentage points. But as of Thursday,<a data-footnote-id="45" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-45" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>45</sup></a> his approval rating stood at 47.1 percent and his disapproval rating at 47.0 percent, for a net approval rating of +0.1 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In an era of deep political polarization where <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-should-still-pay-attention-to-joe-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we rarely see big shifts</a> in public opinion of presidents, this counts as a pretty big swing.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="920" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/biden-approval-rating-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/biden-approval-rating-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/biden-approval-rating-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/biden-approval-rating-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">There seem to be two separate events driving this rapid decline. First, Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell 2.5 points from July 26 to Aug. 5</a> as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the delta variant surged</a>. This slide is reflected in Biden’s overall handling of COVID-19, too. His <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating on that issue</a> fell about 3 points, from about 60 percent to 57 percent, after hovering in the low 60s for much of his presidency. And it’s continued to tick down from there:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1306" height="648" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-26-at-2.11.36-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-26-at-2.11.36-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-26-at-2.11.36-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-26-at-2.11.36-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Then <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/afghanistan-has-fallen-to-the-taliban-how-will-americans-judge-bidens-decision-to-withdraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things fell apart in Afghanistan</a> just weeks before the last remaining U.S. troops were scheduled to leave the country. On Aug. 15, the U.S.-backed government completed its collapse and the Taliban fully returned to power after being pushed out by U.S.-led military forces in 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Initially, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/04/21/afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans overwhelmingly supported</a> Biden’s decision in April to withdraw the remaining U.S. military forces from the country. Even now, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/politics/polls-afghanistan-biden/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are more in favor of leaving than staying</a>, but most Americans think Biden has handled the withdrawal poorly. Last weekend, a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-troop-removal-biden-approval-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov survey</a> found that about 3 in 4 Americans felt the withdrawal was going “very” or “somewhat badly,” while a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/24/afghanistan-woes-sink-bidens-approval-41-usa-today-suffolk-poll/8244854002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today/Suffolk University poll</a> released on Tuesday found that 62 percent disapproved of how the Biden administration has handled the withdrawal. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s unclear whether the circumstances in Afghanistan are entirely responsible for the roughly 3-point decline in Biden’s approval rating since Aug. 5, given the continued prevalence of the delta variant in the U.S. Moreover, as I wrote <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier in August</a>, some of Biden’s dip in approval could be related to growing economic concerns and a souring among some independent voters. That said, there’s no question that at least part of Biden’s decline in approval has been fueled by what’s happened in Afghanistan. And it could fall even more. A pair of suicide bombers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/26/world/afghanistan-taliban-biden-news?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed at least 60 Afghans and 12 American troops</a> outside the Kabul airport yesterday, an attack that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/isis-claims-responsibility-explosions-kabuls-airport-agenda/story?id=79661533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISIS-K claimed responsibility for</a> and which could further sour American public opinion on Biden’s handling of the withdrawal.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As such, Biden’s approval rating might not bounce back just yet given how volatile the situation is in Afghanistan, but at the same time there is reason to believe it eventually will. That’s because polls conducted amid a high-profile event often show large shifts in opinion that then fade over time. We’ve also seen some reversion to the mean for recent presidents’ approval ratings after their ratings fell. Early in his presidency, Donald Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-james-comey-fired/story?id=47309009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired then-FBI Director James Comey</a> amid ongoing investigations of his administration for Russian interference in the 2016 election and then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed classified intel to Russian officials</a> in a meeting at the White House the next day. In the aftermath of these events, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s approval rating fell</a> from about 42 percent on May 9 to 38 percent in early June. But his approval rating then inched back up to around 40 percent later that month.<a data-footnote-id="46" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-46" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a postscript, despite his reputation as being impervious to scandal, Trump often experienced brief blips in his approval rating. His approval rating would fall for a brief period below 40 percent then bounce back up. But by May 2019, his approval rating &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mostly settled&lt;/a&gt; just above or below 42 percent for the next year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>46</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, though, Biden’s approval rating might fall a bit further before it reverts to any sort of mean. This is in part because the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-pressure-g7-leader-extend-afghanistan-withdrawal-deadline/story?id=79617715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final withdrawal of American troops is set for next week,</a> and that could go awry given how precarious the situation is in Afghanistan. Moreover, the delta variant and corresponding economic concerns aren’t <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/08/24/covid-vaccine-efficacy-delta-variant-cdc-study-los-angeles/5578703001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessarily going away anytime soon</a>. An early August survey <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354026/satisfaction-drops-covid-resurges-top-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Gallup found</a> that just 23 percent of Americans were satisfied with the way things were going in the United States, down from 36 percent in May. Meanwhile, Gallup also found that Americans once again view COVID-19 as the country’s most important problem after concerns had dipped in the spring and early summer. And as our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential approval tracker of Biden’s response to the coronavirus</a> shows, just 53 percent of Americans now approve of his handling of the pandemic. What happens next in Afghanistan will be important for Biden’s approval rating, but equally important is whether Biden is able to navigate the other challenges facing him.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Two new surveys from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/parents-school-covid-19-opinion-poll/">CBS News/YouGov</a> and <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/support-for-mask-and-vaccine-mandates-in-schools/">Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> found that about 6 in 10 respondents thought in-person students should be required to wear masks. CBS News/YouGov polled parents of school-age kids and found that 58 percent felt masks should be required for students, while 36 percent said they should be optional (6 percent said they shouldn’t be allowed). Meanwhile, AP/NORC polled all adults and found that 58 percent strongly or somewhat favored mask-wearing for children. Both polls found predictable partisan divides on the issue, with more than 8 in 10 Democrats agreeing masks should be required or favoring mask-wearing, while only around 3 in 10 Republicans felt the same.</li><li>Vaccinated Americans <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-booster">may soon need a booster shot</a> to combat COVID-19, and a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/25/covid-booster-shot-poll/">Morning Consult survey</a> found that 77 percent of vaccinated adults said they would get a booster if it were recommended, while 12 percent said they were unsure and 5 percent were opposed. An additional 6 percent said they’d already gotten a booster shot, which has been encouraged for people with compromised immune systems or organ transplant recipients. The survey was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0818-covid-19-booster-shots.html">conducted right around the time</a> the Biden administration announced that booster shots would be recommended.</li><li>Speaking of parents, they believe it’s harder to be a parent now than 20 years ago, according to a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/majority-parents-say-it-harder-be-parent-now-compared-20-years-ago">new survey by Ipsos</a>. Overall, 69 percent of parents felt this way, with more mothers (72 percent) than fathers (65 percent) agreeing with that sentiment. This split may have something to do with the fact that 87 percent of women with children under 18 said in the same survey that they were “responsible for the majority of childcare and decision-making in the household,” compared with 69 percent of men. Overall, though, 88 percent of parents agreed that it was more expensive to be a parent now than 20 years ago.</li><li>More than eight months after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/attitudes-jan-6-capitol-attack-settle-along-familiar-partisan-lines-n1277534">NBC News found</a> that attitudes toward the attack have settled along somewhat typical partisan lines. According to the poll, 59 percent of Americans agreed it was an attempt to overturn the election versus 38 percent who disagreed, with 89 percent of Democrats agreeing compared with just 32 percent of Republicans (56 percent of independents also agreed). Meanwhile, 46 percent of Americans agreed that the incident had been exaggerated to discredit Trump versus 50 percent who disagreed, with 82 percent of Republicans agreeing compared with only 12 percent of Democrats (43 percent of independents also agreed).</li><li>After <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/8/18/22631299/mike-richards-jeopardy-host-search-process-past-comments">allegations</a> broke last week that “Jeopardy!” executive producer Mike Richards had used sexist and demeaning language, Richards quickly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/business/mike-richards-quits-jeopardy.html">stepped down</a> as the next host of the TV quiz show. In a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/24/jeopardy-post-richards-poll-burton/">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted after Richards had bowed out, 17 percent of the show’s viewers said they wanted actor and longtime “Reading Rainbow” TV host LeVar Burton to be the next permanent host, the most of any candidates named. Former “Jeopardy!” contestant Ken Jennings was second at 14 percent, followed by actor and neuroscientist Mayim Bialik at 12 percent, with the remaining contenders all at 8 percent or lower. Bialik was already in line to host special editions of the show, but following Richards’s exit, she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/media/mayim-bialik-jeopardy/index.html">took over temporary hosting duties</a>.</li></ul><p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-ending-war-afghanistan-79488089</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">If you had to guess which House candidate has raised the most money so far, you might guess that person was a well-heeled incumbent or someone running in a competitive district. After all, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/incumbent-advantage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incumbents usually have a lot of cash on hand</a> and <a href="http://goodliffe.byu.edu/papers/primgen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive races tend to attract more money</a> because they are more likely to determine which party wins power.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, among non-incumbent candidates running for the House in 2022, the top fundraiser is a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/democratic-veteran-challenges-twisted-qanon-promoting-greene/2JF4KV2RPBH6XETYMVWLOODFXA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrat with no political experience running in a deep-red seat</a>: Democrat Marcus Flowers <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/GA/14/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised over $2 million</a> (as of June 30) in his bid to unseat controversial Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, which is a whopping 55 percentage points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric</a>.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Flowers’s windfall might seem strange given the long odds he — or any Democrat — faces in defeating Greene, but it also reflects a growing trend wherein candidates with little hope of winning still achieve eye-popping fundraising hauls. Based on political science research and an analysis of congressional fundraising, it’s clear that these candidates are the beneficiaries of two larger trends in American politics: a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong antipathy for the opposing party</a> and the ease with which someone can now <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-actblue-is-trying-to-turn-small-donations-into-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donate to a campaign</a> on <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/08/actblue-outraises-winred-gop-catching-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the internet</a>. And together, these forces can help long-shot candidates bring in huge sums — whether they are no-name candidates or well-qualified contenders.</p>



<h2><strong>Long odds, but lots of cash</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, long-shot candidates showed just how much they could fundraise by running against a loathed opponent and/or by going viral online. For instance, despite never having held elected office or run in a high-profile campaign, six Republican challengers raised at least $2 million in House races they then lost by anywhere from 20 to 45 points. Raising <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/national/2020/12/lacy-johnson-had-almost-no-chance-of-defeating-rep-ilhan-omar-he-still-raised-more-money-than-any-other-congressional-candidate-in-minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly from individual donors</a>, Republican challenger Lacy Johnson <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MN/05/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought in the most</a>, $12.2 million, running against Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar. Other Republican challengers raised large sums as well: <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/21/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Cummings raised $11.2 million</a> against New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/43/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Collins raised $10.6 million</a> against California Rep. Maxine Waters, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MD/07/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Klacik raised $8.3 million</a> against Maryland Rep. Kweisi Mfume,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wypr.org/wypr-news/2020-04-28/democrat-kweisi-mfume-wins-race-to-replace-the-late-elijah-cummings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Klacik first ran in a special election&lt;/a&gt; against Mfume in April 2020, to succeed the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. Mfume won that race, but Klacik was also the GOP nominee in that November’s general election against Mfume. Klacik &lt;a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MD/07/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raised $8.3 million for the entire cycle&lt;/a&gt;, with at least $8 million of her contributions coming &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the special election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/28/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Early raised $4.1 million</a> against California Rep. Adam Schiff and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/21/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Loomer raised $2.3 million</a> against Florida Rep. Lois Frankel. And as the chart below shows, those fundraising numbers are truly staggering for just how much they differed from those of Republican nominees in other very Democratic-leaning House seats.</p>

<div><iframe title="A few long-shot Republicans raised millions in 2020" aria-label="chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Tqr45/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="700" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In at least four of these races, negative partisanship seems to have been the main motivation for the gobs of money raised. As members of the so-called “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/17/20696474/squad-congresswomen-trump-pressley-aoc-omar-tlaib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squad</a>,” Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/ocasio-cortez-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile targets of derision</a> in conservative circles, while Waters is also <a href="https://www.axios.com/derek-chauvin-trial-maxine-waters-7f122d0b-6826-4c7d-b8ec-6288d31964a0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loathed</a> by conservatives and Schiff earned infamy among conservatives after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/22/politics/adam-schiff-senate-impeachment-trial-2020/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading Democrats’ impeachment efforts</a> in the House. Meanwhile, the other two campaigns seem to have hinged more on gaining traction online. Mfume, for instance, is not that well-known nationally, but Klacik’s <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/elections/bs-md-pol-klacik-fundraising-20201016-g4td5mmbkjhpdpgooywx4wtmgq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign still went viral</a> after then-President Donald Trump retweeted her campaign ad in August 2020; the ad showed her marching through a dilapidated area of Baltimore, and it helped her <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00726117/1515670/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise $6.5 million</a> from July through September that year — the largest haul in a single reporting period by any of these four candidates. Frankel also isn’t a high-profile Democrat, but Loomer was still able to bring in a sizable fundrasing haul thanks to her <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/laura-loomers-nonsensical-lawsuit-against-cair-killed-by-judge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large online presence</a> as a vocal promoter of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/19/21375159/laura-loomer-congress-republican-florida-trump-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim rhetoric</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These six long-shot Republican campaigns are outliers for the amount of money they raised. For comparison’s sake, these candidates raised a total of nearly $49 million, compared to a median fundraising haul of about $54,000 by GOP nominees in districts that were 15 points or more Democratic. But <a href="https://politicalscience.byu.edu/directory/jay-goodliffe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Goodliffe</a>, a political scientist at Brigham Young University <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/who-donates-in-campaigns/3F136D6FF1AEDBECB6D34CAF2C4C8083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who studies campaign donors</a>, told me that the environment to raise vast sums of money in noncompetitive races has only improved in recent years. For one thing, the internet has made it much simpler to send candidates money. And on top of that, many small donors now contribute as a way of expressing their political preferences, not because they are being strategic or expect to “get something” from their donation. “You're not expecting to affect the election with your $100 donation,” said Goodliffe. “You may not even be expecting to be able to call up that person and ask to have a meeting with them. You're just donating because you feel good about that.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And long-shot Republicans aren’t the only ones benefiting from this phenomenon. Although we saw more big hauls on the GOP side in 2020 House races, Democrat Phil Ehr <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8FL01107/?cycle=2020&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also brought in</a> $2 million to challenge Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, whose district was R+43. Gaetz, of course, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has attracted scorn from Democrats</a> given his vocal support for Trump, even before his recent scandal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over alleged sex trafficking</a>, but Ehr still lost by about 31 points. And as the 2022 election cycle ramps up, at least one Democrat -- the aforementioned Flowers -- <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/14/a-would-be-opponent-crashes-a-marjorie-taylor-greene-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has already launched a long-shot bid</a> fueled by disdain of the other party.</p>



<h2><strong>High-quality candidates can go to the bank, too</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The same forces at play with these lesser-known, long-shot House candidates also apply to higher-profile contenders with more <a href="http://ces.iga.ucdavis.edu/mwpsa99.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional markers of candidate quality</a>, such as past political service or elected experience. Arguably no recent candidate better exemplifies this than Democrat <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-a-candidate-in-kentucky-but-can-she-beat-mitch-mcconnell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy McGrath</a>, who challenged then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kenutcky in the state’s 2020 Senate race. McGrath had only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/kentucky-house-district-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly lost</a> her high-profile 2018 House race, and in her 2020 Senate bid, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0KY00339/?cycle=2020&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she raised $96.3 million</a> — more than <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/fundraising-totals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but six Senate contenders</a> from either party. But despite her credentials as a former fighter pilot and much-ballyhooed candidate in a competitive 2018 House race, McGrath still <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=21&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost by nearly 20 points</a> to McConnell in the deep-red state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/folly-just-throwing-money-political-candidates/617074/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rage-donating</a>” isn’t limited to just outlandish, viral candidates who don’t really stand a chance. It can also play a big role in high-profile and potentially competitive races like McGrath’s, as one reason she managed to bring in so much money is simple: <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/0v9p6tn6ur/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats <em>really</em> dislike McConnell</a>. “McConnell represents the Senate Republicans and perhaps the Republican Party,” said Goodliffe, and he told me that’s significant because a candidate’s opponent increasingly can be what motivates someone to contribute money to a campaign. Another example of this phenomenon in 2020 was contributions to the Senate campaign of Jaime Harrison, a former chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party. On the one hand, Harrison’s race against Sen. Lindsey Graham was more competitive than McGrath’s, so Democratic donors might have thought it was more strategic to donate to his campaign, but on the other hand, the incredible amount of money he brought in -- <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/SC/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$132.7 million</a> -- has to reflect, in part, just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/us/politics/jaime-harrison-lindsey-graham-south-carolina.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how infuriated Democrats were with Graham</a> given his support for Trump and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/us/politics/lindsey-graham-barrett-confirmation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the role he played in the Senate confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett</a> to the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/26/927640619/senate-confirms-amy-coney-barrett-to-the-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right before the election</a>. Harrison didn’t lose as badly as McGrath, but he still lost to Graham <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=45&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 10 points</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to the 2022 election, one parallel in this category of candidates is Democratic state Sen. Kerry Donovan’s 2022 <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2021/04/01/lauren-boebert-kerry-donovan-campaign-fundraising-2022-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House campaign</a> in Colorado against GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, who, like Greene, is also the <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2021/04/01/scoop-inside-dems-challenge-to-take-down-lauren-boebert-492324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject of much Democratic ire</a>. As a state legislator, Donovan checks the high-quality candidate box, as her current position <a href="https://www.stephenoconnell.org/files/McOC_LegislativeCareers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been one of the more successful paths</a> to winning a seat in the House. But unless <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a> produces a friendlier district than the current R+12 seat that Boebert occupies, it will be hard for Donovan to unseat Boebert. (Moreover, Colorado’s independent redistricting commission’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/preliminary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first map proposal actually made the district slightly redder</a>.) That said, given Boebert’s unpopularity among Democrats nationally, it’s not surprising that Donovan’s campaign has already attracted $1.2 million, making Donovan’s haul the third-highest total raised by a non-incumbent House candidate this cycle.</p>



<h2><strong>What this means for campaigns and candidates</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Making a fundraising splash is always a priority for campaigns, but these recent campaigns provide a roadmap for how even long-shot candidates can get there. Klacik and Flowers, for instance, produced an army of small-dollar donors despite the long-odds of their respective campaigns. Take Flowers: 90 percent of <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2GA14044/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the money he’s raised</a> has come from donors giving no more than $200. To put that in perspective, the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/large-vs-small-donations?cycle=2020&amp;type=M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest share of small-dollar donors for any House incumbent in 2020</a> was about 80 percent, which went to Ocasio-Cortez, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-viral-videos-20180718-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who went viral</a> in 2018 when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/nyregion/joseph-crowley-ocasio-cortez-democratic-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she first ran and defeated</a> Rep. Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent, in the Democratic primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s impossible to know when a long-shot candidate’s ad might hit a nerve or get a retweet from a president, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21244667/election-candidates-zoom-campaign-social-media-politicians-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the payoff can be huge</a>, which is one reason we might see more campaigns like this. “It’s so unpredictable, right?” said <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/about/staff.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheila Krumholz</a>, executive director of OpenSecrets, which monitors campaign finance data. “That's how it is in all walks of life now. Some kids and elderly persons and just somebody you would never have heard from otherwise has a TikTok video. Maybe they didn't even post it themselves, but suddenly it's just everywhere. The point is, we see this in politics, too.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, while we can’t know whether a certain long-shot candidate’s campaign will take off, the benefits of running and gaining national recognition might outweigh the very real downsides of likely losing, since a losing campaign can still be a stepping stone to future opportunities — either in elected office or in working around politics and media more generally. “Although you're losing on this initial one, it helps you build recognition, a fundraising network,” said Goodliffe. A good example of this is Harrison, who is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/22/959573611/dnc-chairman-jaime-harrison-wants-to-build-the-next-generation-of-democratic-tal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now chairman of the Democratic National Committee</a>. And even among the less credentialed GOP House challengers who raised more than $2 million in 2020, other opportunities have popped up. Klacik, for instance, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/klacik-gop-campaign-donations/2021/03/02/76300fde-7077-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has regularly appeared</a> on conservative media outlets and recently <a href="https://www.axios.com/maryland-republican-returns-consultants-trashed-317ebdcf-2148-4dd6-90bf-791e3661c379.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched her own political action committee</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These campaigns <a href="https://www.axios.com/republican-consultant-campaign-donations-89fd8660-68c9-4943-8ba6-8697263bfeb9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can also result</a> in consultants and vendors “making out like bandits,” Krumholz told me. For instance, in Johnson’s campaign against Omar, fundraising vendors working with the campaign <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/17/10164/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took in around $4 million</a> of the $12.2 million Johnson raised, in some cases by grabbing 70 to 80 cents of each dollar the firm raised. And in Klacik’s campaign, the firm hired to promote her viral video <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/klacik-gop-campaign-donations/2021/03/02/76300fde-7077-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended up being paid</a> $3.7 million of the $8.3 million she raised, by keeping 70 percent of the donations the video attracted. These sorts of high margins charged by campaign vendors <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/dc-fundraising-firm-takes-big-cut-of-contributions-701" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are nothing new</a>, but consultants stand to hit the jackpot if they’re working for a low-profile candidate who goes viral.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As such, experts I talked with told me we’re likely to see more — not fewer — little-known candidates try to break out and raise buckets of money in races where they attract tons of eyeballs or challenge a politician who their party despises. “When you lower the costs [of donating] and you have this negative partisanship going on, then you're going to find a lot more of these kinds of donations,” said Goodliffe.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the race to get Americans vaccinated, two groups are commanding a lot of attention: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/why-so-many-republicans-wont-get-vaccinated/619659/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-08-10/white-evangelical-churches-and-the-crisis-of-vaccine-hesitancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white evangelicals</a>. Both are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/unvaccinated-america-in-5-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to have been vaccinated already and more likely to refuse</a> vaccination altogether.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s the overlap between white Republicans and white evangelicals that is especially telling, as white evangelical Republicans are among the most likely groups in the U.S. to refuse vaccination. According to a <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/religious-vaccines-covid-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June survey</a> by the Public Religion Research Institute, where I’m the research director, and the Interfaith Youth Core, white evangelical Republicans were considerably less likely to say they were vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated as soon as possible (53 percent) than Republicans who were not white evangelicals (62 percent). Moreover, white evangelical Republicans were the most likely of any large subgroup we surveyed to say they were refusing to get vaccinated (26 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That the combination of being a Republican and a white evangelical would form a particularly toxic anti-vax stew, more significant than party or religion alone, seems obvious to me, but then again, I grew up in rural Texas — I see this combination of beliefs in motion every day on Facebook, where I’m connected to many high school and college classmates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRRI’s 2020 religion census</a>, the county where I lived longest as a kid (Leon) is 72 percent white Christian, including 44 percent white evangelical, and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election data shows</a> 87 percent of the county voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020. <a href="https://tabexternal.dshs.texas.gov/t/THD/views/COVID-19VaccineinTexasDashboard/Summary?%3Aembed=y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just over one-third</a> of the county’s eligible population is fully vaccinated, even though COVID-19 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/leon-texas-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case rates are higher than they have ever been</a>. At least three people who went to high school with me have died, while tracking statistics say at least 1 in 9 Leon County residents have been ill — almost as many as in New York City (1 in 8), one of the hardest-hit areas in the country, and well over the rate in Washington, D.C. (1 in 13), where I live now.</p>

					</aside><p data-paragraph="main">This is significant because Leon County is extremely rural, with <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/leoncountytexas/PST045219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 20,000 total residents</a>, including less than 2,000 in Buffalo, the town I lived near. For reference, <a href="https://www.publicschoolreview.com/buffalo-high-school-profile/75831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my high school</a> has only about 260 students at any given time. If you need ICU treatment, you have to travel — there are currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/leon-texas-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no hospitals with ICUs</a> in the county. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what is also significant about Leon County is the role religion has played in residents’ low vaccination rates even when faced with death from the coronavirus. When my classmates were hospitalized with COVID-19, there were repeated calls for prayers and proclamations that God would provide healing. When they died, those prayer requests became comments that “God called [them] home.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The belief that God controls everything that happens in the world is a core tenet of evangelicalism — 84 percent of white evangelicals agreed with this statement <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2011/march/polling-evangelicals-god-causes-disasters-us-should-help.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in PRRI polling</a> from 2011, while far fewer nonwhite, non-evangelical Christians shared this belief. The same poll also showed that white evangelicals were more likely than any other Christian group to believe that God would punish nations for the sins of some of its citizens and that <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/few-americans-see-earthquakes-floods-and-other-natural-disasters-a-sign-from-god-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural disasters were a sign from God</a>. What’s more, other research from the Journal of Psychology and Theology has found that some evangelical Christians <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0091647118807187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rationalize illnesses like cancer</a> as God’s will. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is why I remember friends and acquaintances in Leon County when I think about how religious beliefs influence one’s attitude toward COVID-19 and vaccination. PRRI’s <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/prri-ifyc-covid-vaccine-religion-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March survey</a> found that 28 percent of white evangelical Republicans agreed that “God always rewards those who have faith with good health and will protect them from being infected with COVID-19,” compared with 23 percent of Republicans who were not white evangelicals. And that belief correlates more closely with vaccination views among white evangelical Republicans — 44 percent of those who said God would protect them from the virus also said they would refuse to get vaccinated. That number drops to 32 percent among Republicans who are not white evangelicals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Complicating matters further, the pandemic also fits neatly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-apocalypse-religion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into “end times” thinking</a> — the belief that the end of the world and God’s ultimate judgment is coming soon. In fact, nearly two-thirds of white evangelical Republicans (64 percent) from our March survey agreed that the chaos in the country today meant the “end times” were near. Faced, then, with the belief that death and the end of the world are <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-heaven-97670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fulfillment of God’s will</a>, it becomes difficult to convince these believers that vaccines are necessary. Sixty-nine percent of white evangelical Republicans who said they refused to get vaccinated agreed that the end times were near. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, given how many white evangelicals identify as Republican or lean Republican — about 4 in 5 per our June survey — disentangling evangelicals’ religious and political beliefs is nearly impossible. Consider how many white evangelical leaders like former Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. downplayed the severity of the pandemic <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-coronavirus-quarantine-rhetoric-fuels-dangerously-politicized-pandemic-ncna1170406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in line with Trump</a>. Falwell was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-evangelicals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardly the only evangelical leader</a> to do this either. If anything, the pattern of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/us/covid-vaccine-evangelicals/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white evangelical resistance</a> to vaccination has reached the point where some white evangelical leaders who might otherwise urge vaccination <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-religion-coronavirus-pandemic-7a03fed8e7548797487f2b7a20161e4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hesitate to do so</a> because of the political climate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the same survey, about 2 in 5 white evangelical Republicans (43 percent), and Republicans more broadly (41 percent), said one reason they hadn’t gotten vaccinated was that the COVID-19 pandemic had been overblown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that most white evangelical Republicans, and Republicans in general, disagreed with our question about the Golden Rule, that “because getting vaccinated against COVID-19 helps protect everyone, it is a way to live out the religious principle of loving my neighbors” (57 percent and 58 percent, respectively). This may be because for some white evangelicals and Republicans, politics and religion are inseparable — and God’s will, or their interpretation of it, controls everything.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">For two months we’ve known that Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams won New York City’s Democratic primary for mayor with 31 percent of first-place votes (he finally achieved a majority in the ranked-choice election after <a href="https://vote.nyc/sites/default/files/pdf/election_results/2021/20210622Primary%20Election/rcv/DEM%20Mayor%20Citywide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight rounds</a> of instant runoffs). But for two months we haven’t known for sure exactly what his coalition looked like. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the wait is over: 57 days after the election, the New York City Board of Elections released <a href="https://vote.nyc/page/election-results-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precinct-level results</a> of the primary. And they show that Adams’s enigmatic politics found a broad coalition — but one that exists outside the city’s usual power centers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adams’s politics are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor-nyc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard to pigeonhole</a>. (For instance, the former police officer campaigned as the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/eric-adams-nyc-mayor-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-police candidate</a>, but he had previously been an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/nyregion/eric-adams-nyc-police-mayor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocate for reform</a> within the department.) But perhaps his one unifying characteristic is his anti-elitism, sometimes to the point of grievance. He campaigned first and foremost as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/26/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crusader for New York City’s large nonwhite working class</a>, using Manhattan’s ivory tower and its “fancy candidates” as a foil. When former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia and businessman Andrew Yang formed a last-minute alliance with the goal of stopping Adams, he <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/adams-campaign-calls-garcia-yang-alliance-voter-suppression-on-final-day-of-early-voting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equated it</a> to the suppression of Black and Hispanic voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It looks like that branding succeeded. Adams carried most of the city’s neighborhoods outside its cosmopolitan core. </p>

Going just off voters’ first choices, Adams won three of the five political boroughs, albeit with different levels of support. </p>

</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with Adams’s strongest political borough: the <strong>Black Bloc</strong>, a 63 percent non-Hispanic Black and 23 percent college-educated swath of Brooklyn and Queens. This was Adams’s <a href="https://www.brooklyn-usa.org/eric-adams-bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home turf</a> (he was born in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brownsville and grew up in the Queens neighborhood of South Jamaica), and unsurprisingly, he dominated here, winning 63 percent of first-place votes. Within the borough, he tended to do better in state Assembly districts with larger Black populations and lower median household incomes, although the correlation was stronger with race than with income.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R = 0.91 vs. R = -0.71.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adams also excelled in the Black neighborhoods of the <strong>Crossroads</strong>, a racially diverse political borough that covers zones of transition between the other four. He got at least 45 percent of first-place votes in each of three gentrifying but still majority-Black Assembly districts <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=56&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">east of</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Diana-C-Richardson/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn’s</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Rodneyse-Bichotte-Hermelyn/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospect Park</a>. But parts of the Crossroads with smaller Black populations were more Adams-skeptical, such as two <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=34&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Queens</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Catalina-Cruz/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">districts</a> where he received fewer than 20 percent of initial votes. Overall, his share of first-place votes in the Crossroads borough (37 percent) was fairly close to its Black population share (30 percent).</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/cuomo-resigning-now-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-79389991</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But it wasn’t just in predominantly Black areas that Adams ran up the score. He was the first choice of 47 percent of voters in the <strong>True-Blue Bronx</strong>, which does have a sizable non-Hispanic Black population (29 percent) but is mostly Hispanic (57 percent). While there was still a strong correlation between Adams support and the Black population in this political borough (e.g., he performed the strongest in the heavily Black <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Carl-E-Heastie/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">northeast Bronx</a>), he must also have won significant numbers of Hispanic voters in districts like <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Jos%C3%A9-Rivera/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Belmont and Fordham Manor’s</a>, where the population is 73 percent Hispanic and 16 percent non-Hispanic Black but Adams got 42 percent of the vote. One potential reason: Like the Black Bloc, the True-Blue Bronx is heavily working class (18 percent of residents age 25 or older have at least a bachelor’s degree).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, New York City’s most conservative political borough, the <strong>Lands of Contradiction</strong>, is 46 percent non-Hispanic white, 26 percent Asian American, 19 percent Hispanic and only 5 percent non-Hispanic Black, but Adams still received 25 percent of first-place votes there. He was especially strong in plurality-white Assembly districts like <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Stacey-Pheffer-Amato/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard Beach’s</a> (40 percent) and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Steven-Cymbrowitz/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homecrest’s</a> (41 percent). However, Yang outran Adams in the political borough’s many plurality-Asian American neighborhoods (e.g., <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Ron-Kim/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flushing</a>), edging out Adams for first place in the Lands of Contradiction overall with 27 percent. Of note, both Yang (46 percent) and Adams (38 percent) excelled in the Assembly district that covers <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Simcha-Eichenstein/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borough Park and Midwood</a>, home of several conservative Orthodox Jewish communities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Adams finished third in the predominantly white, college-educated <strong>Elite Circles</strong>, with just 15 percent of first-place votes. Instead, the borough was split on whom it wanted to be mayor: 32 percent of voters there ranked Garcia first, while 27 percent opted for attorney Maya Wiley. But there was a clear difference between the areas that backed Garcia and the areas that backed Wiley. Garcia’s support was strongly correlated with median household income, and she topped 40 percent in each of the city’s five wealthiest Assembly districts — areas such as <a href="https://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/Dan-Quart/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midtown Manhattan</a>, the <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=067&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upper West</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Rebecca-A-Seawright/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Sides</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Jo-Anne-Simon/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downtown Brooklyn</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Wiley (the race’s premier progressive candidate) won younger, more racially diverse parts of the Elite Circles in Brooklyn and Queens — doing especially well (34 percent or more) in Assembly districts containing <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=57&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospect Heights</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Maritza-Davila/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williamsburg</a>, <a href="https://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/Emily-Gallagher/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=36&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astoria and Ditmars Steinway</a>. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that she also did well in gentrifying areas of the Crossroads, such as <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=56&amp;sh=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crown</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Diana-C-Richardson/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heights</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Inez-E-Dickens/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harlem</a>, where she may have paired the support of white progressives with some Black and Hispanic support. (Overall in the Crossroads, Wiley received 25 percent of first-place votes, almost as many as she got in the Elite Circles.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this means that Adams’s path to the nomination circumvented the city’s predominantly white power brokers and cultural trendsetters. Will Adams’s non-elite power base change what he attempts to do in office? On one hand, the outer boroughs and nonwhite New Yorkers may get more attention and appreciation from City Hall. On the other, Adams may struggle to establish productive relationships with the Manhattan-based media, corporations and an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/nyregion/new-york-city-council.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly progressive</a> New York City Council. (Such adversarial relationships crippled outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, and he assembled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/elections/2013/nyc-primary/mayor/map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty broad coalition</a> in his initial 2013 primary win.) If the 2021 campaign was any indication, it’s going to be an interesting next four years in New York City.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">With the release of block-level data from the 2020 census, we now have a much clearer picture of how and where the U.S. population has grown — and shrunk — over the past 10 years. And while Republicans are largely setting the terms of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting process</a> that will ensue from this announcement, the data throws a <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/redistricting/new-census-dataset-mostly-good-news-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-needed lifeline to Democrats</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not because of the country’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/census-shows-us-diversifying-white-population-shrinking-79423764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing racial diversity</a>, though. Sure, under <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current electoral coalitions</a> (where white voters are more likely to vote Republican and voters of color are more likely to vote Democratic), it’s arguably better for Democrats if the nonwhite population grows. But even in a country where only 58 percent of residents are non-Hispanic white, the 2020 presidential election was still very competitive. And electoral coalitions can change — for instance, Republicans may continue to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54972389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gain ground</a> among nonwhite voters in future elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, the good news for Democrats came in which parts of the country <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/8/17/2046167/-We-ve-got-census-growth-data-for-every-city-county-and-district-and-there-are-lots-of-surprises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained and lost population since the 2010 census</a>. Despite the country’s overall population increasing by 7.4 percent, rural areas — the reddest parts of the country — have steadily <em>lost</em> residents over the past 10 years. The average county with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight urbanization index</a> below 8<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index is a measure of how densely populated a county or county equivalent is based on the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of a given resident. The analysis in this article includes Washington, D.C., but excludes Alaska, which does not have county-equivalent-level election results available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> lost 3.1 percent of its population between 2010 and 2020. This encompasses the 1,430 most rural counties in America — 1,302 of which voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020, and only 127 of which voted for President Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, the fastest-growing parts of the country are the suburbs. The average county with an urbanization index between 11 and 13 (spanning from sparse suburban areas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_County,_Virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roanoke County, Virginia</a>, to dense suburban areas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_County,_New_Jersey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Union County, New Jersey</a>) grew by 9.6 percent between 2010 and 2020. Most of these counties (194 out of 264) voted for Biden, and if the trends of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 elections</a> continue, they will only get bluer.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-2020-census-good-news-democrats-nate-silver-79467274</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">America’s cities grew at a healthy rate too, which was something of a surprise compared with pre-census estimates. The 18 most urban counties or county equivalents in the country — those with a FiveThirtyEight urbanization index above 13 (including San Francisco, Philadelphia, four around Washington, D.C., and eight around New York City) — grew by an average of 8.4 percent — and all but one of them voted for Biden in 2020.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump-voting exception was Richmond County, New York, which is Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, the average county that voted for Biden boosted its population by 3.4 percent between 2010 and 2020, while the average Trump county grew by just 0.2 percent. Strikingly, 370 out of the 538 Biden counties (69 percent) gained population, while 1,468 out of the 2,574 Trump counties (57 percent) lost residents.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These population shifts are important because they will shape the nation’s political geography for the next 10 years, as congressional district lines will be drawn based on this data. As such, it will now be that much harder to draw congressional maps that favor Republicans: If a heavily Democratic metropolitan area is overflowing with people, map-drawers need to put them <em>somewhere</em> — which may necessitate creating an extra (blue) district for that city, or at least including more blue precincts in a neighboring Republican district than the GOP would like.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the other end of the spectrum, because congressional districts must have roughly equal populations, many depopulated rural congressional districts will need to expand — either cannibalizing a neighboring rural district (which could reduce the number of safely red seats) or encroaching on the outer suburbs. Because America’s exurbs are still fairly red (three-quarters of counties with a FiveThirtyEight urbanization index between 10 and 11 voted for Trump in 2020) this could reduce the number of Republicans living in a current swing district — a sort of redistricting domino effect.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">We can see how this domino effect might unfold by looking at which congressional districts, rather than counties, are over- and underpopulated. To see this, we can <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/8/16/2045702/-Morning-Digest-New-census-data-shows-which-districts-will-have-to-grow-or-shrink-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compare the 2020 population of each current district</a> to what its population should look like after the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reapportionment process</a>. (Remember, because each state’s districts must have the same population, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VsWXBX_cVFcfaxHdlAMzzhJYRWgayzWxsJ3rdOlO-24/edit#gid=1761243994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target population</a> of a state’s districts is the state’s 2020 population divided by the number of congressional districts it received in reapportionment.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the map below, orange districts will need to add population (i.e., they will need to expand), while purple ones will need to lose population (i.e., they will need to get smaller).</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Where congressional districts could shrink or grow" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lEddh/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="555" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The most obvious examples of districts that will need to expand are those in states that lost a seat in reapportionment, like West Virginia. But take a look at New York, which also lost a seat. The districts that will need to expand the most are all in upstate New York, while four New York City-based districts — the 5th, 8th, 10th and 12th — will actually need to <em>shed</em> residents. Since those districts are all extremely blue, that will provide mapmakers with an opportunity to add Democratic votes to nearby districts that might not be as safe, such as the 11th. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, in Illinois, the districts around Chicago are those that are already closest to their target post-redistricting population, whereas the downstate 12th and 17th will need to add the most people. And because Illinois also lost a seat in reapportionment, it’s most likely that downstate will lose representation. Since five of Illinois’s six current downstate representatives are Republicans (and Democrats control the map-drawing process in Illinois), that makes it a safe bet that Republicans will draw the short straw. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, patterns in population growth could blunt Republican gains as well. For example, the two most overpopulated current districts in North Carolina — which is gaining a seat — are the deep-blue 2nd (which covers Raleigh) and 12th (which covers Charlotte). Republicans are in charge of redistricting in North Carolina, but they would have to engage in some complicated gerrymandering gymnastics if they want to blunt the political power of these metro areas. Similarly, the Cook Political Report’s Dave Wasserman has <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/redistricting/new-census-dataset-mostly-good-news-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that explosive population growth in urban areas like Austin could limit Texas Republicans to a map where Republicans have the advantage in only 25 of the state’s now-38 districts, whereas previously they might have been able to draw 27 Republican-leaning seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, as Wasserman’s estimate makes clear, the population trends from the 2020 census are not enough to cancel out any gerrymandering efforts. Rather, the census numbers are merely a silver lining for Democrats. They still remain at a serious disadvantage in the 2021 redistricting cycle simply because Republicans will control the redrawing of more congressional districts. Republicans will have full control over the redrawing of 43 percent of congressional districts, and Democrats will have full control over the redrawing of just 17 percent. (Neither party enjoys full control of redistricting for 38 percent of districts, while the remaining 1 percent are at-large districts and won’t be redrawn at all.) </p>



<figure><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rakich-skelley.REAPPORTIONMENT.04TK.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rakich-skelley.REAPPORTIONMENT.04TK.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rakich-skelley.REAPPORTIONMENT.04TK.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rakich-skelley.REAPPORTIONMENT.04TK.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">So Democrats got some good news with the specific census data released earlier this month, but they are still in an unenviable position. As long as redistricting remains such a subjective process, who draws the maps will remain more important than the underlying data.</p>
