<p data-paragraph="main">Election Day is almost here, and millions around the country have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/politics/pre-election-early-absentee-voting-midterms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already cast their vote</a>. With this in mind, we wanted to use the last wave of our <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a> before the midterm elections to dive deeper into which issues are driving Americans’ decision-making in the final weeks of the campaign. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we’ve been asking the same 2,000 Americans about their biggest concerns and what they think about both major parties in the lead-up to the elections. This time around, we devoted much of our time analyzing the views of likely voters. We examined how different issues could affect their vote choices, their attitudes toward Democrats or Republicans and their perceptions of the parties’ values.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In each of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/american-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our surveys this year</a>, “inflation or increasing costs” has ranked as the most important concern for the country, and it was no different this time around, as 65 percent of Americans selected that issue.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted Oct. 13-23, 2022, among 1,540 respondents. As was the case in the previous waves of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple-choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. The sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> This marked a new high in any of our six waves of issue polling, an indication that concerns about inflation have risen ahead of the election — a potentially beneficial political development for Republicans, who as the out-party can capitalize on the public’s economic concerns. Rounding out the top three issues were “political extremism or polarization” (32 percent) and “crime or gun violence” (28 percent). Meanwhile, “immigration” and “climate change” ranked fourth and fifth at 21 percent and 16 percent.</p>

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> Overall, our poll found likely voters split evenly at 41 percent over whether they planned to vote for a Democrat or a Republican in the upcoming congressional election, about the same as in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our September wave</a>. But because most likely voters will vote Democratic or Republican, we asked the other respondents — those who were undecided, planned to vote for an independent or third-party candidate, would not vote or skipped the question — which major party they would support if they <em>had</em> to choose, as voters who lean toward one party <a href="https://agadjanianpolitics.wordpress.com/2017/01/02/charting-the-behavior-of-leaners-vs-partisans-from-self-described-partisanship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to vote for that party</a>. Even with those responses incorporated, however, likely voters remained almost evenly divided: Forty-nine percent said they would back a Democratic candidate, and 48 percent a Republican one. Nearly all self-identified Democrats and Republicans planned to vote for their respective parties, while independents preferred Democrats over Republicans, 49 percent to 42 percent.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked to choose between the major parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, in a development that could redound to the GOP’s advantage, 63 percent of likely voters named inflation as a top concern for the country. Republican likely voters have consistently been more likely to name inflation as a leading issue, and 77 percent did so in the sixth wave. But 44 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents also indicated rising costs were a top issue, high-water marks for both groups across our polling. And the latter figure might be especially important because independents who named inflation as a top issue broke 54 percent to 36 percent for Republicans when we asked them to choose a party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while likely voters were split on which party they planned to vote for, they largely felt that neither party had earned the right to govern after November. Overall, 51 percent of likely voters said Democrats hadn’t earned another two years controlling the federal government, while 39 percent said they had.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likely voters could select “yes,” “no,” “don’t know” or skip the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> Among independents, 50 percent said Democrats didn’t deserve another two years and 34 percent said they did, while Democrats and Republicans mostly answered in accordance with their party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet things were no better for the GOP, as 55 percent of likely voters also said Republicans had not made a good case for why they should be given control of Congress for the next two years, compared with 35 percent who said they had. Notably, 61 percent of independents said the GOP had not, while just 27 percent said they had (once again, Democrats and Republicans largely answered in line with their partisan views). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also asked respondents <em>why</em> they felt each party had or hadn’t earned the right to govern. Sixty-eight percent of likely voters who didn’t think the Democratic Party should have continued control said its policies and plans were moving the country in the wrong direction. A 41-year-old Republican multiracial woman from Oklahoma said that Democrats “create tension between groups who feel marginalized at the expense of the country to create an emotional frenzy that will drive people to the polls. I am a former Democrat and feel disgust at the lack of morals or ethics shown by the party.” Among those who thought Democrats should continue to govern, 44 percent cited their belief that Democrats were moving the country in the right direction, while 17 percent cited their work to pass major and important legislation. Another 19 percent also said Democrats should have control simply because they were “better than the Republicans.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Democrats' supporters and critics both point to their policies" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5qTrJ/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="672" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for those who wanted Republicans to control Congress, 51 percent cited GOP policies and plans, while 28 percent answered because “Democrats are ruining the country.” Just 13 percent answered that they thought the GOP would do a better job dealing with the economy, although some voters thinking about inflation or rising costs may have indicated that they broadly preferred Republican policies. Meanwhile, there wasn’t one obvious reason why some likely voters felt the GOP shouldn’t have power: Thirty-six percent said GOP policies and plans would move the country in the wrong direction, 30 percent said Republicans had not presented a clear plan for what they would do in Congress, and 16 percent felt Republican “values and beliefs were bad or wrong.” When asked to describe the values and beliefs of the GOP, a 72-year-old woman from California who identified as a Democrat wrote, “The current group calling themselves the Republican Party are a corrupt group who are no longer disguising their true intentions, which are solely to create immense personal wealth and power for themselves.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Many critics of Republicans want a clearer plan from the GOP" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DW6Vh/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="600" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also wanted to know what voters thought were the values and beliefs of the two major parties. Overall, almost 79 percent of likely voters said they understood the values and beliefs of each party “very” or “somewhat” well, but there were some notable, if unsurprising, differences.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options included “not very well,” “not at all” or skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> About 9 in 10 Democrats and Republicans said they knew their party, whereas around two-thirds said the same of the opposition. Meanwhile, about 80 percent of independents said they understood each party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When asked to describe the values and beliefs of the opposing party, likely voters didn’t hold back. A 28-year-old man from California who identified as a person of color and a Democrat said the GOP aims to “protect the rich and corrupt, lie and gaslight to fool citizens, utilize religion and the media to control the narrative, and reinstate racism and division.” Meanwhile, a 37-year-old white woman from New Hampshire who identified as a Republican argued Democrats “want people dependent on the government” and “are in favor of murdering babies and keeping people poor.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not all negative attitudes toward the opposing party. Some Republicans have drawn a line against their own party on issues such as abortion: “The party has also lost itself in the abortion debate and does not seem to want to understand a balance between fetal rights and women’s reproductive rights and health,” said a 60-year-old white man from Georgia. On the other side of the aisle, a 38-year-old white man from Florida complained about his party, the Democrats, paying “lip service to progressivism while maintaining the status quo.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In less than two weeks, how voters weigh the interplay of these issues, policy preferences and partisan loyalties will help determine the results of the 2022 midterm elections. Republicans have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capturing the House</a>, while control of the Senate looks <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very much up for grabs</a>. After the election, we plan to examine what voters have to say about those results and what they think about our political system moving forward. But until then, we’ll have to wait and see how the midterms play out. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Welcome to </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/invisible-divides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Invisible Divides</em></a><em>, a series exploring the profound differences in worldview between Democrats and Republicans. These beliefs about education, religion, gender, race, and political extremism align with partisanship — but run much deeper. Differences like these don’t just influence the ways Democrats and Republicans vote, but also how they think about their place in America. And they help explain why opposing views on important issues today seem increasingly irreconcilable.</em></p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">After Crystal Vasquez became a Christian, she noticed that people were getting mad at her a lot more. She’d get scolded for responding to a piece of good news with “Praise God!” A friend with a transgender child stopped speaking to her out of the blue, saying that their children couldn’t play together because Vasquez, 34, is Christian. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, in the few short years since converting, Vasquez has come to view Christians’ place in American society very differently than she did before. She said the people around her were acting like she was trying to shove Christianity down their throats when all she wanted to do was express her beliefs and add a little more love to the world. “I think Christians are discriminated against,” Vasquez said. “We act like they have all this power, but really we’re just raising our voices and getting ignored.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the idea that Christians are an increasingly persecuted minority is far from a consensus view — even among Christians themselves. Kathy Watson, 67, is an evangelical Christian but told me she didn’t understand why so many Christians say they’re discriminated against. If anything, she said, Christians have too much power, and use it to inflict a rigid set of values on people who don’t share them. “A lot of evangelical Christians — I think they’ve confused being Christian with being Republican,” she said. “They want to have strict rules and regulations and they want everyone to be like them, and they’re using the political system — the judges they’ve appointed, the politicians they’ve elected — to impose that worldview on other people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a sense, in conversations with voters like Watson and Vasquez, that the country is in the midst of a reckoning over what it means to be Christian in America.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystal Vasquez, Kathy Watson, Becky Carrizales and Scott Barum participated in FiveThirtyEight’s survey with PerryUndem and YouGov. Carolyn Novak participated in an online focus group conducted separately by FiveThirtyEight and PerryUndem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> On one side, there are the people who see Christians <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/the-christians-who-believe-theyre-being-persecuted-in-america/488468/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the victims</a> of a successful campaign to infuse the country with secular values, forcing Christians — particularly conservative ones — to accept values they violently disagree with. But many Americans think Christians occupy a very different role. In their version of the country’s current drama, Christians are the villains, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/us/christian-nationalism-politicians.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ensconcing their own beliefs in law and politics</a> even as their numbers dwindle. There’s a thread of unease on both sides — as if the one thing everyone agrees on is that these two ways of thinking about Christianity in America simply can’t coexist.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/538-PerryUndem-YouGov-Survey_Topline-Results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/PerryUndem/YouGov survey</a> of likely voters shows just how deep this fissure runs.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted Aug. 10-21, 2022, among 1,796 likely voters, including oversamples of Black, Latino and Asian American/Pacific Islander respondents. Likely voters included registered voters who said that they are “almost certain to” or will “probably” vote in the November midterm elections. The sample is weighted to match the general population. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> In this second installment of our exploration of invisible divides — the differences in worldview that shape how people vote and think about their place in America — <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/538-regression-placeholder.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we found profound disagreements</a> about how much power Christians really have, and the role they should play in the country’s politics and culture. Like the other divides we’re exploring, these divisions track fairly neatly along partisan lines and help explain why the gap between Republicans and Democrats sometimes feels unbridgeable: It’s because their ways of thinking about the world are increasingly irreconcilable.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Are Christians victims? It depends on who you ask. Nearly half (46 percent) of survey respondents told us that discrimination against Christians is a problem in American society today, while a majority (54 percent) think it’s not.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked how big of a problem they viewed each topic from a list of 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> They were also divided along similar lines about whether far-right Christians are trying to impose their beliefs on other people: A majority (56 percent) agreed they are, while another 33 percent disagreed, and 10 percent weren’t sure. The political fissures on this question are as wide as religious divides, like church attendance, and sometimes wider — signaling that anxiety about what it means to be Christian may be shaped as much by people’s political allegiances as their religious ties.</p>

In the 1980s and 1990s, as white Christian conservatives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/religion-politics-evangelicals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forged an alliance with the Republican Party</a>, Christianity itself <a href="https://religionnews.com/2021/10/04/pat-robertson-turned-christian-tv-into-political-power-and-blew-it-up-with-wacky-prophecy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started to become</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-w-and-the-christian-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a partisan symbol</a>. Identifying as a Christian was no longer just about theology, community or family history — to many Americans, the label became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/opinion/evangelical-republican.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncomfortably tangled</a> with the Christian Right’s political agenda, which was itself becoming <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/01/1109141110/the-christian-right-is-winning-cultural-battles-while-public-opinion-disagrees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly hard to separate</a> from the GOP’s political agenda. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo28246146.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social scientists have argued compellingly</a> that left-leaning Americans started to reject religious labels altogether around this time <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088891?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of the perception</a> that Christianity was becoming tainted by politics. The rise in the share of Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/modeling-the-future-of-religion-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who have no religion</a> wasn’t just about loss of belief — it was about the rejection of a political identity, too. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-christian-right-is-helping-drive-liberals-away-from-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to this theory</a>, people who had relatively weak ties to religion — the ones who attended church once a month, or twice a year — started slipping away, discomfited by the idea of calling themselves Christians because of the term’s new political baggage. <a href="https://nathanael.id/download/2018-Putting%20Politics%20First.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study found</a> that simply showing participants a newspaper clipping where a Republican politician spoke at a church prompted some Democrats to say they had no religion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Carolyn Novak, 54, didn’t stop calling herself a Christian because she no longer followed Jesus. Instead, she stopped going to the Southern Baptist church she’d attended for years because she felt like it made people assume things about her that weren’t true. She found herself increasingly at odds with her fellow churchgoers. “Being labeled a Christian, [people think] you’re some kind of right-wing nut,” Novak said. Recently, she’s even stopped socializing with the people from her old church and is avoiding making new Christian friends. “People I’ve known for years, I can’t even talk to them,” she said. “I keep thinking, ‘Were you always this angry and hateful?’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These trends, meanwhile, have reinforced a long-held feeling of embattlement among some Christians, particularly conservative ones. From the beginning of the Christian Right’s alliance with the Republican Party, the movement’s predominantly white leaders have presented themselves as the standard-bearers of a beleaguered cause. The country <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3flSfjLfYNEC&amp;dq=Evangelicals+and+Democracy+in+America%3A+Religion+and+Politics%2C+Volume+2&amp;q=secular+liberalism#v=snippet&amp;q=moral%20relativism&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was secularizing</a>; the feminist movement was <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pat-robertson-feminist-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaining ground</a>; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion was legal</a>; divorce rates <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/51/2/587/169435/Breaking-Up-Is-Hard-to-Count-The-Rise-of-Divorce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were high</a>; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/25660/chapter-abstract/193101621?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school prayer was outlawed</a>; <a href="https://religionandpolitics.org/2021/06/29/how-white-southern-christians-fought-to-preserve-segregation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial integration was mandated</a> for schools. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the years went on, this defensiveness was further entrenched by the election of the first Black president — who was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/09/14/a-startling-number-of-americans-still-believe-president-obama-is-a-muslim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falsely portrayed</a> as a Muslim by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-muslims/republicans-attack-obama-over-muslim-center-comments-idUSTRE67E0XC20100815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing media and politicians</a> — the legalization of same-sex marriage, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise/#:~:text=The%20growth%20in%20the%20number,older%20generations%20by%20newer%20ones." target="_blank" rel="noopener">dwindling church attendance</a>. The Christian Right’s battles increasingly revolved around <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-christian-right-has-a-new-strategy-on-gay-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the preservation of rights for Christians</a>, tacitly conceding their status as a cultural minority. Former president Donald Trump <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/trumps-age-old-christian-persecution-complex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capitalized on these feelings</a> of persecution politically and actually appears to have brought some of his nonreligious followers into the fold. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/15/more-white-americans-adopted-than-shed-evangelical-label-during-trump-presidency-especially-his-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pew Research Center study</a> released in 2021 found that some white respondents who had warm feelings about Trump but hadn’t previously identified as evangelical Christians began to embrace the label after Trump was elected. It was yet more evidence that Americans’ political perspectives are doing more and more work to <a href="https://www.rienner.com/uploads/5cbf8b764f751.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape their religious identities</a> — even if it’s not happening consciously.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, the beliefs and actions of a relatively small group of people may be calcifying this divide. A minority of Americans support views that could be described as Christian nationalist, an ideology <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/33661" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defined by social scientists</a> as the belief that the U.S. is a Christian nation, and should be returned to its Christian foundations — by force, if necessary. According to our survey, only 27 percent of respondents agreed that the “government should favor Christianity over other religions,” and even fewer (22 percent) said that “God has called on conservative Christians to take control of our politics and culture.” Only 13 percent said that “the federal government should advocate for Christian religious values,”<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options included “the federal government should advocate for moral values that are shared by people of many faiths,” “the federal government should not advocate for any specific set of moral values,” “neither/no opinion” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> and 19 percent said that “the federal government should stop enforcing separation of church and state.”<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options included “the federal government should enforce separation of church and state,” “neither/no opinion” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;

Doug Mastriano</a>, the Republican candidate for governor, who has presented his own extreme political views <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/a-pennsylvania-lawmaker-and-the-resurgence-of-christian-nationalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a battle against the forces of evil</a>. The fact that candidates like Mastriano aren’t relegated to the fringes makes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/opinion/jan-6-christian-nationalism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some Americans worry</a> that this small group is shaping the course of American politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Watson, who identifies as a political independent, told me that the Supreme Court’s decision to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn Roe v. Wade</a> this summer was a sign of how far conservative Christians were willing to go to enforce their ideology. “[Republicans] have appointed all these judges who are very strict about what a Christian worldview means,” she said. “There have always been people who were extremely pious who wanted the world to be their way, and I think those people have a lot of power right now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Talking to Democrats like Novak, there’s often a palpable feeling of bitterness toward conservative Christians and their role in shaping politics — and hostility toward religion itself. That can leave even some Democrats feeling nettled. I spoke with Becky Carrizales, 49, a Catholic Democrat who believes that other Democrats may be afraid to identify as Christian because the label is so associated with the Republican Party. “I have lots of friends on Twitter and if I post anything religious, you know, I’ll get attacked by fellow Democrats,” she said. “They’ll say, ‘Why are you a Catholic? [Catholics] are going against everything we believe in.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But on the right, that hostility mostly reinforces the idea that liberals really are trying to stifle traditional Christian values — making Christians the real victims. One survey respondent, Scott Barum, 54, identifies as a Christian but doesn’t attend church or belong to a denomination. He said from his perspective, it’s secular values — like gay rights — that are being forced on the country. “The whole LGBTQ agenda, transgenderism — don’t force-feed it to Americans who aren’t going to change their minds,” Barum said. “I believe the country wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in if we had conservative Christians in power.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a cyclical feeling to these conversations — a sense of one view reinforcing another, which reinforces another, which reinforces another — that has created an almost impenetrable barrier between the two sides. There are people, like Carrizales, who are managing to balance religious and political identities that feel increasingly at odds. But competing perceptions of Christianity’s power seem unlikely to change — if anything, they may deepen further. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Novak told me that she wants moderate Americans to have more of a voice. She wishes that everyone was less angry. But when I asked her whether she thinks about reconnecting with Christians she’s estranged from, she sighed and said no. “I think sometimes about the time when Americans could agree, when there was a middle ground,” she said. “But it’s so hard to even imagine. Now I mostly sit and go, ‘Did we ever really do that?’”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Can we trust election polls?” is a question that has reached a fever pitch in political junkie circles dating back to the 2016 election. One popular theory about why election polls missed in 2016 and 2020 is that Trump-friendly voters <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-supporters-arent-shy-but-polls-could-still-be-missing-some-of-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to respond to surveys</a>, making Trump’s support among the population appear lower than it actually was. People give many anecdotal reasons for why this happened, but the big takeaway from this theory is that election surveys are undercounting Republicans and Trump voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, many proponents of this theory lack data when making this assertion. The <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a>, conducted using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, can shed some light on whether this is happening in 2022. Back in April, we launched a panel study with a group of about 2,000 Americans whose demographic makeup was representative of the U.S. The goal of the project was to see how their fears and beliefs changed in the six months leading up to the midterm elections. However, we’ve found this project has additional, unintended value. Following that initial survey, there was a large drop-off in participation in the second wave and a smaller drop-off between the second and third wave, after which participation largely plateaued. In total, there was a 23 percent decline in the number of participants between the first wave and the sixth and most recent wave (the results of this wave are forthcoming).<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also saw &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2018/10/09/the-rbs-poll-comports-well-with-data-from-the-full-voter-file-about-the-partisanship-of-registered-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;typical declines in the shares of responses&lt;/a&gt; by age and race, among other demographic groupings, such that younger, Black and Hispanic respondents participated at lower rates relative to other age groups and races and ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a> This allows us, in a limited way, to examine something called “nonresponse bias” — that is, who is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/24/opinion/frustrated-with-polling-pollsters-are-too.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>not</em> answering surveys</a> — and how it impacts polling data.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our data indicates that some respondents who lean toward the Republican Party are less likely to take part in follow-up surveys. But we didn’t find ourselves in a situation where <em>all</em> Republicans were not answering, and we were able to find a few clues as to who exactly these Republican non-respondents could be.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The charts below show the share of various types of respondents from our initial survey who then took part in subsequent waves.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares calculated for this analysis are not weighted. We’re focusing on unweighted data here to examine the raw number of people participating in surveys, their demographic breakdown and how that changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> By looking at each individual wave, we can get a sense of response rates for the different demographic groups we’ve surveyed: </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Republicans were more likely to stop responding to our survey" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iU68a/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="600" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">People who said they voted for Trump in 2020 and that they plan to vote for Republicans in the midterms this year have very high response rates relative to the overall sample. (It’s worth noting, however, that recalled vote choice is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2110693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a perfect measure</a>. We’re using it here as a proxy for partisanship and political engagement.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Likely nonvoters were most likely to ghost us" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1ECKd/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="600" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, for most of the time series, we see a dramatic drop-off in response rates among 2020 Trump voters who say they are <em>not</em> likely to vote for Republicans this year or people who say they view Trump “very” favorably (as opposed to “somewhat” favorably). </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, people who said they get most of their news from Fox News were also more likely than the average respondent to continue in the survey. And Americans who primarily get their news from social media or who do not consume political news at all were also among the most likely to drop out.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked what their main source of news is. “Mainstream” sources include the answer choices “ABC / CBS / NBC News,” “The New York Times, Washington Post or Wall Street Journal,” “Telemundo,” “Univision,” “public television or radio” or “your local newspaper.” “Social” includes “YouTube” or “social media.” “Online” refers to “digital or online news.” Other options included “FOX News,” “MSNBC,” “CNN,” “Other” or “None of these” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Fox News viewers were likely to stick around in our survey" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eSCMn/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="650" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taken together, we have a picture of a specific slice of the Republican electorate that might not be responding to surveys: the Trump-supporting, social media news consumer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite these differences in response rates, there is another factor we must take into account about how election surveys are conducted: “weighting” to match the demographics of the electorate. Since the 2020 election, weighting to vote choice or other political characteristics has become much more widespread. Our FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey weights for participation and vote preference in the 2020 election. These political weights can go a long way in repairing any gaps in the sample. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One way to visualize the partisan impact of the sample is with the generic congressional ballot, which asks respondents if they plan to support an unnamed Democrat or Republican in an upcoming election. When we look at how respondents answered to the generic ballot in the first wave with our <em>unweighted</em> data, we can see clearly how the people who participated in our first wave and our most recent wave skewed Republican (33 percent) and independent (36 percent). The remaining sample in our most recent wave continues to show a slight skew towards Republicans, with 32 percent choosing the Democrat compared to 34 percent the Republican, suggesting the share of the sample planning to vote Democratic has increased. Meanwhile, independents were the largest group that failed to respond to the latest wave. If we left the data unweighted, we could possibly be overreporting the potential performance of Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, when we adjust the data with weighting that incorporates 2020 vote preferences, we see there is no such skew. If anything, our latest wave leans slightly more Republican than it was before we weighted it. This suggests that weighting for vote preference can slightly <em>overcorrect</em> for missing Republican or Trump-leaning voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Weighting results helps correct imbalances in response rates" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZJ5q4/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, this analysis is based on a single series of surveys that revisits the same people. And while we try to account for some margin of error in our polling, there is likely still some level of nonresponse bias in our initial pool of respondents that goes beyond what we can measure in this analytic exercise. However, these nonresponse patterns are indicative of the groups that are challenging for most survey research to reach and, as a result, may help reveal the types of people missing in contemporary public polling. At the same time, it’s also clear that much of that skew can be accounted for by using appropriate weighting techniques to bring estimates back in line with benchmark information about the population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Returning to whether nonresponse bias causes pollsters to underestimate Republican support, we are left with a definite “it depends.” On one hand, our research provides some evidence that particular Trump-leaning voters are less likely to participate in surveys over time. If this is true more widely, the polls could be understating GOP support. However, we also show that there are certainly Republicans in these election polls and survey weighting can correct for this handful of missing respondents. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In September, <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/west-virginia-gov-justice-signs-abortion-ban-into-law/article_5bade5ae-35de-11ed-afc5-ebffc22475a7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Virginia</a> passed a law effectively banning abortion. In July, <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/07/22/newsom-signs-first-in-nation-bill-allowing-residents-to-sue-makers-sellers-of-illegal-assault-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> enacted a law allowing citizens to sue gun merchants for making or selling illegal firearms. In 2021, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-georgias-new-voting-law-is-such-a-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-have-made-it-harder-to-vote-in-11-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas</a> were among the states to tighten their voting laws in response to false claims of voter fraud. The same year, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/2/22/22295393/illinois-governor-jb-pritzker-criminal-justice-reform-bill-cash-bail-police-bodycams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois</a> became the first state to eliminate cash bail.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These momentous policy changes were only possible because the same party controlled the state Senate, state House and governorship. When one party enjoys a state-government “trifecta” or has enough of a legislative majority to override vetoes by a governor of the opposite party, it can enact virtually any legislation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Currently, 44 percent of the population<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> resides in one of the 25 states where Republicans control state government, and 38 percent live in one of the 16 states controlled by Democrats. But that could change after the midterms when <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_legislative_elections,_2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">88 state-legislative chambers</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36 governorships</a> are on the ballot.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">While <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-redistricting-affects-the-battle-for-state-legislatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of competitive state legislatures</a> shrank to a handful as a result of redistricting, there are still 10 states where one party could seize full control of state government this year. And there are eight states where one party may lose complete control. So here are the races on the ballot this November that will decide the future of policymaking in those states.</p>



<h2><strong>Where either party could take full control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Six states could end 2022 under total Democratic control, Republican control <em>or</em> divided government. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with three states where Democrats currently control the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature, but could potentially lose all three. In <strong>Nevada</strong>, the governor’s race is a toss-up, according to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All forecast odds are as of 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, Oct. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> And although Democratic mapmakers tried to make the chamber more solidly Democratic in redistricting, the state Assembly is rated “Lean Democratic” by <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/nevada#lower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNalysis</a>, a state-legislative forecasting website. Republicans could also flip the state Senate, though that will likely be a taller order. There are only <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/nevada#upper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three competitive seats</a> this cycle, and Republicans need to win all three to take control, including one with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a> of D+7.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maine</strong> is another Democratic-controlled state that could become completely red. Despite being slightly more Democratic-leaning than the country as a whole, Maine has a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maine/articles/2021-09-29/maine-lawmakers-to-have-final-say-on-redistricting-proposal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan redistricting process</a> that yielded a state House map with a median seat that leans <em>Republican</em> (R+2). The new state Senate map, with a median seat of D+2, is also competitive and has attracted <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2022/10/16/top-battlegrounds-in-battle-for-maine-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more campaign spending</a> than the House. That said, Democrats have reason to be optimistic. Through the first week of October, they had spent <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2022/10/16/democrats-allies-are-spending-big-in-bid-to-keep-control-of-maines-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four times more</a> on state-legislative races than Republicans, and Republicans have only an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/maine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside shot</a> at picking up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blaine_House" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s mansion</a>. Still, if even one chamber flips, Republicans will have deprived Democrats of total control.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Oregon</strong> has emerged as a problem spot for Democrats, partly because of outgoing Democratic Gov. Kate Brown’s <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/05/new-poll-finds-kate-brown-is-nations-least-popular-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopularity</a>. The race to replace her is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tight</a>, and Democratic control of the legislature is also threatened. The Republican State Leadership Committee named Oregon <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/briefs/national-republicans-list-oregon-as-top-target-for-flipping-legislative-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of its top targets</a>, and local billionaire Phil Knight has invested <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/09/29/nike-co-founder-phil-knight-spends-big-oregon-legislature-republican-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least $2 million</a> in electing Republican legislators. Local experts consider the state Senate more flippable than the state House and have <a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/19/oregon-2022-midterm-election-republican-democrat-house-senate-seats-races/66120125007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified around six competitive seats</a>. However, the House’s median seat is less blue than the Senate’s, and <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/oregon#lower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNalysis</a> thinks the House could change hands too. A tie is a real possibility too, since each chamber in Oregon has an even number of seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three other currently divided states could conceivably fall under total Democratic or Republican control. After years of <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/maps-show-how-gerrymandering-benefitted-michigan-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gerrymandering-fueled</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTxxrLQlnrEl9ocgwUM7EL4PasH-5lmyf7sttn2GSMg/edit#gid=235559234" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican dominance</a>, <strong>Michigan</strong> finally has fair state-legislative maps this year thanks to the state’s new <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/new-districts-give-democrats-chance-flip-michigan-legislature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent redistricting commission</a>. As a result, Democrats have a real chance to win the state House for the first time since 2011 and the state Senate for the first time since 1984. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/AdImpact_Pol/status/1575167120425783297?s=20&amp;t=bXCwnS0YIxH6_xvXbQZ8dA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdImpact</a>, $23 million had been spent on Michigan state-legislative races as of late September — more than any other state — and $18 million was from Democrats. With Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely to win reelection</a>, a Democratic trifecta seems within reach. However, Republicans remain <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/michigan#upper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive</a> in the <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/michigan#lower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislature</a>, and the GOP could gain complete control if the party can upset Whitmer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting made the <strong>Pennsylvania</strong> state House more competitive, too; the new median seat has a partisan lean of R+4, just 1 point redder than the state as a whole. Democrats are <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-democrats-control-of-state-house-20220825.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting 14 districts</a>, mainly in the suburbs, that President Biden would have carried in 2020. They need to flip 12 to end the majority Republicans have enjoyed since 2011. However, it would probably take a Democratic or Republican landslide to make Pennsylvania a one-party-rule state. That’s because Republicans are <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/pennsylvania#upper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly favored</a> to maintain their 28-year majority in the state Senate. Democrats would need to win every seat on the ballot with an R+6 partisan lean or bluer to tie the chamber (in which case the lieutenant governor would break ties). Conversely, it will be hard for Republicans to fully control the state because Democrats have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid lead</a> in the governor’s race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, in <strong>Minnesota</strong>, the local Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party currently controls the governorship and the state House, while Republicans hold the state Senate. All three could change hands this November, though the DFL is likelier than Republicans to take full control. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comfortably favored</a> to win reelection. But the legislature is a <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/minnesota/its-a-toss-up-whether-gop-or-dfl-will-control-in-minnesota-legislature-but-handful-of-districts-will-be-key" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toss-up</a>. There are as many as <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/09/14/minnesota-house-senate-election-outlook-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 competitive districts in the Senate</a> (the DFL needs to flip only three to take control) and 27 in the House (Republicans need only four).</p>



<h2><strong>Where Republicans could take full control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then there are three states currently under a divided government that Republicans could win all for themselves, but Democrats realistically can’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alaska</strong> would already be under total GOP control if moderate Republican and independent representatives didn’t form a coalition with Democrats to govern the state House. But with redistricting and retirements likely to result in <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2022/05/26/departing-incumbents-and-new-districts-set-stage-for-high-turnover-in-alaska-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of turnover in Juneau</a>, mainline Republicans are hoping to take back control. According to the <a href="https://alaskalandmine.com/landmines/three-key-anchorage-races-will-determine-if-republicans-take-control-of-state-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska Landmine</a>, non-coalition Republicans are safe bets to win 19 out of the House’s 40 seats. Three more seats are competitive, and two more will likely elect Republicans who may or may not join the coalition. But some observers think the new maps and ranked-choice voting system could result in <em>more </em>legislators joining the coalition in the House — and maybe even forming one in the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>North Carolina</strong>, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s term runs through 2024. But Democrats don’t have a <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/uphill-battle-for-gop-supermajority-in-the-n-c-general-assembly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">realistic path to a legislative majority</a>. So Republicans could still have free rein to legislate if they pick up two seats in the state Senate and three in the state House. That would give the GOP a three-fifths majority in each chamber — enough to override Cooper’s vetoes. Cooper has issued a <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/verify/yes-gov-cooper-has-vetoed-more-bills-than-any-other-governor-in-north-carolina/275-15ef835a-452a-4f20-bc2c-69fa4d9ddffa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic number</a> of vetoes to kill bills related to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/roy-cooper-north-carolina-2022-midterm-election-abortion/671770/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting, COVID-19, guns</a>, <a href="https://www.wral.com/cooper-vetoes-critical-race-theory-rioting-bills/19868716/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests and critical race theory</a>. If Republicans win a supermajority, their leaders have said they would like to <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/article265886936.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revisit some of those bills</a> and pass <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/abortion-access-in-north-carolina-might-hinge-on-5-seats-in-the-state-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more restrictions on abortion</a>. <a href="https://www.johnlocke.org/will-republicans-win-supermajorities-in-the-north-carolina-general-assembly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In-state experts</a> have <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/2022-elections/2022/10/19/can-the-gop-get-a-supermajority-in-the-n-c--legislature--it-comes-down-to-a-handful-of-seats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified</a> eight to nine competitive districts in the state Senate and 19 to 20 in the state House. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Wisconsin</strong>’s new state-legislative maps are also safely Republican, so control of Wisconsin state government will likely come down to the governor’s race. According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is ever so slightly favored over Republican businessman Tim Michels. But Republicans could also take control by securing veto-proof majorities in the legislature (in this case, two-thirds of each chamber). That looks <a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/panelists-say-gop-has-good-shot-at-supermajority-in-senate-tougher-path-in-assembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doable</a> in the state Senate, where Republicans need only one more seat, but it’s <a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/republicans-look-for-veto-proof-wisconsin-legislature-majorities-in-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more uncertain</a> in the state Assembly, where they’ll need to flip five. Like Cooper, Evers has vetoed a <a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/wisconsin-republicans-veto-proof-supermajority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic number of bills</a> — 126 during the last legislative session — on topics like <a href="https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2022/10/could-republicans-win-a-legislative-supermajority-in-wisconsin?ct=content_open&amp;cv=cbox_latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election administration, education funding and guns</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Where Democrats could take full control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is one state where Democrats can take complete control but Republicans can’t: <strong>Vermont</strong>. Republican Gov. Phil Scott is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but certain</a> to get reelected, and Democrats’ state-legislative majorities are more than secure. However, there is a chance that Democrats could achieve the two-thirds majorities needed to <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/10/12/stowes-house-seat-has-long-been-a-democratic-white-whale-can-they-finally-flip-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">override Scott’s vetoes</a> without any third-party support. (There are currently a handful of state representatives not aligned with either major party.) Democrats already have <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/people/all/2022/Senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 out of 30 seats</a> in the state Senate and need to pick up <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/people/all/2022/House" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just two seats</a> in the state House to hit two-thirds. However, Republicans also hope they can gain <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/06/05/the-paperwork-is-in-here-are-most-of-the-legislative-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five House seats</a> to sustain Scott’s vetoes without third-party support. (They have a chance to whittle the Democratic supermajority <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/10/12/sen-mark-macdonald-hospitalized-after-experiencing-mild-stroke-family-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the state Senate</a> as well.)</p>



<h2><strong>Where Republicans could break Democratic control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two states currently controlled by one party could be reduced to a divided government this election cycle. In <strong>New Mexico</strong>, Republicans have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 1-in-8 chance</a> to defeat Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. Still, they can’t take complete control because the Democratic-held state Senate isn’t up for election until 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democrats are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe bets</a> to hold onto the <strong>Colorado</strong> governor’s office. But the state legislature is in play thanks to an independent redistricting commission that appears to have gone out of its way to draw competitive seats. On paper, the state House is a tough but doable flip for Republicans; its median seat has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+6. However, Democrats currently have a <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/legislators?field_chamber_target_id=1&amp;field_political_affiliation_target_id=All&amp;sort_bef_combine=field_last_name_value%20ASC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17-seat majority</a>, so in-state observers <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/09/13/colorado-elections-2022-republicans-state-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consider the state Senate a more realistic target</a>. Out of the <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/10/07/7-colorado-senate-seats-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven Senate districts</a> that are competitive, Republicans will have to win six to take control. Some individual districts have seen as much as <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/10/08/colorado-house-senate-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 million in campaign spending</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Where Democrats could break Republican control</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans have enjoyed full control of <strong>Arizona</strong> state government since 2009, but their time may soon end. The governor’s race leans <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly toward the Republicans</a>, and the GOP has just a two-seat majority in both the state Senate and the state House. However, redistricting made the Arizona state-legislative map <a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/arizonas-new-legislative-map-appears-to-give-republicans-an-edge/article_df92dfc8-6375-11ec-a36a-ef00daf8da0c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friendlier to the GOP</a>, so it will be hard for Democrats to win outright majorities. The Senate and House use the same map, with each district electing one senator and two representatives. In the state House, Democrats have <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/07/arizona-legislature-key-races-watch-november-democrats-republicans/10382960002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopted the controversial strategy</a> of running just one candidate each in four key districts, ceding their shot at a majority to increase the odds of a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/incaseofatie.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tied chamber</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <strong>New Hampshire</strong>, Republicans took complete control of state government after the 2020 elections, and Democrats are eager to flip them back. The 400-member state House is prone to wild swings from election to election: It went from a 225-175 Republican majority <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_2017_March_1_9%20am.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after 2016</a> to a 234-166 Democratic majority <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_2019_February%201st.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after 2018</a> to a 213-187 Republican majority <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/elections/Legis_Control_2-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after 2020</a>.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a large legislature in such a small state means that only a few votes are cast for each seat, making it easier for just a handful of swing voters to change an election result. In addition, some New Hampshire state House districts are represented by multiple representatives, so when one district swings, it can affect several seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is also <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/newly-united-democrats-aim-to-flip-these-key-state-seats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting the state Senate</a>, but that will be <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2022-10-24/nh-state-senate-redistricting-gerrymandering-elections-voting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more difficult</a>. Democrats would have to win at least one district that former President Donald Trump carried in 2020 to gain a majority. Even if they manage that, they almost certainly won’t take complete control since Republican Gov. Chris Sununu is a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid bet</a> to win reelection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite <strong>Kansas</strong> having a Democratic governor, Republicans currently have full control of the Sunflower State because they have veto-proof majorities in the state legislature. However, Democrats need to flip only three Republican-held state House seats to break that supermajority. (The state Senate is not up for election this year.) <a href="https://t.co/yB25BVCeD8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are targeting districts</a> Biden carried in 2020 in cities like Manhattan and Emporia and, especially, the Kansas City suburbs. But if they want to sustain Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s vetoes, they will also need Kelly to win reelection; she currently has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-in-5 chance</a> of doing so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, there are three red states with safely Republican legislatures but where Democrats have an outside shot at breaking up a GOP monopoly by winning the governor’s office. The most realistic of these is <strong>Georgia</strong>, where Democratic former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1-in-10 chance of victory</a>. Democrats have only about a 1-in-20 chance of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipping</a> the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governorships</a> of <strong>Florid</strong><strong>a</strong> or <strong>Texas</strong>. And in Florida, Republicans have a <a href="https://mcimaps.com/the-2022-florida-state-senate-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">path to a supermajority</a> in the state legislature, allowing them to override a Democratic governor’s vetoes.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, the most likely outcome of the 2022 election in Washington, D.C., is a split government, with Republicans controlling at least one chamber of Congress but Democrats still holding the White House. That could very well mean that the only policymaking of note for the next two years will take place on the state level. They may not get the same amount of attention, but these races for state legislature and governor are arguably more important ones on the ballot this year.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">For political candidates from underrepresented groups, progress can be uneven — and the 2022 midterms could be a great example of that, at least when it comes to women candidates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, it looks like we’re heading for a record-setting year for women in governors’ races. According to our forecast, there are 12 female gubernatorial candidates who have at least a 50-in-100 chance of winning in FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, as of Tuesday at 12 p.m. Eastern. If each were to win their election, it would be historic. Up until now, <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/levels-office/statewide-elective-executive/history-women-governors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only nine women have simultaneously occupied</a> governors’ mansions. And two of the most competitive governors’ races — in Oregon and Arizona — have only women as major candidates, which increases the odds that the record will be broken this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the outlook isn’t so good for women running for Congress. Several of the most vulnerable congressional candidates are women, including many Democratic House candidates who flipped seats in 2018. And it’s quite possible that the number of women in Congress will decline after the November elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So why do women candidates’ fortunes seem to be on the wane in some cases and not others? <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-women-candidates-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we pointed out earlier this month</a>, fewer women are running for Congress than in previous years — and the success of the previous two cycles may have made leaders in both parties feel like there’s less of a need to focus on getting more women elected. “When you talk about the pink wave or the ‘Year of the Woman,’ it makes people think that things are done, that women have taken over,” said <a href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/kelly-dittmar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly Dittmar</a>, an associate professor of political science at Rutgers University and the director of research at the Center for Women and Politics, “when in reality they’re still less than 30 percent of the U.S. Congress.”</p>



<h2><strong>Women could make history in gubernatorial races</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Women are underrepresented at every level of government, but it’s proven particularly hard for female candidates to win governorships. In the country’s history, only 45 women have served as governors, and there are <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/levels-office/statewide-elective-executive/history-women-governors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 states that have never had a female governor</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those numbers seem very likely to change this year. There are 25 women affiliated with a major party running for governor, and 12 of them have a 50-in-100 or greater chance of winning their race, according to our Deluxe forecast as of Tuesday at 12 p.m. Eastern. (All data in this story is as of that same date and time.) Of course, their odds vary a lot. But as the table below shows, nine women are at least likely to win their races — which means they have a minimum of a 75-in-100 chance of winning. Two of those candidates could set records for their state: Democrats Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Kathy Hochul of New York, both of whom would become the first woman <em>elected</em> as governor of their states.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, then-Lt. Gov. Jane Swift of Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/11/us/in-a-first-woman-takes-over-governorship-of-massachusetts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;took over&lt;/a&gt; after then-Gov. Paul Cellucci resigned, making her the first woman to serve as governor of the state. In 2021, then-Lt. Gov.

<p data-paragraph="main">The other three races are tighter, but regardless of what happens, they’ll result in at least two new female governors. That’s because women are running against each other in two of those close races. Right now, Republican Christine Drazan has a 51-in-100 chance of winning against Democrat Tina Kotek in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oregon governor’s race</a>, and Republican Kari Lake has a 58-in-100 chance of winning against Democrat Katie Hobbs in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona governor’s race</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These gains are significant because even as the number of women <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/15/a-record-number-of-women-are-serving-in-the-117th-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Congress</a> and <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/the-rise-of-women-in-state-legislatures-a-state-by-state-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state legislatures</a> has steadily increased, the number in governors’ seats has remained low. That’s partially because there simply aren’t a lot of those seats to fill, but it’s also because voters’ prejudice against female candidates are particularly strong when women run for executive-level offices, like governor or president. Several decades of social science research has found that voters are <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Anzia_Bernhard_WomeninLocalElections_3_29_19.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more comfortable</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-13540-003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electing women</a> when they run to be part of a group — like a state legislature or Congress — <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2901548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather than a position</a> of high-level leadership, although some evidence shows that Democratic-leaning voters have become more open to the idea. Voters are especially likely to associate such roles <a href="https://ww3.aauw.org/research/barriers-and-bias/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with stereotypically masculine behaviors</a> like aggression and initiative, which may cloud how they see women who run for those offices. And then there’s the fact that the decision to run for office can <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/440330#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involve more considerations</a> for women than it does for men, such as balancing their priorities at home, and many women may <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/upshot/the-problem-for-women-is-not-winning-its-deciding-to-run.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose not to throw their hat into the ring</a> for prestigious offices like governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few reasons why this might be changing. Dittmar pointed out that <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/05/07/record-women-governor-2018-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high numbers of women ran for governor in 2018</a> as well — so in that sense, the trend is just continuing this year. And as more women get elected to lower-level offices, the bench of potential nominees with electoral experience is growing. For example, Hobbs currently <a href="https://azsos.gov/about-office/about-secretary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serves as the Arizona secretary of state</a> — a role that left her well-positioned to run for governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More women running for governor — and winning — is a noteworthy change in the status quo. But it’s not a full transformation, particularly because the pool of women likely to win gubernatorial races is overwhelmingly white.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on candidate race and ethnicity was collected by political scientists Bernard Fraga and Hunter Rendleman. They relied on statements made by candidates, membership in racial and ethnic caucuses or organizations, racial and ethnic advocacy organizations, news articles and candidate websites. This research is, by nature, not comprehensive — for example, Fraga and Rendleman were unable to confirm some candidates’ racial identities — but the data is close enough to identify important trends. It is also worth noting that some candidates belong to multiple races or ethnicities. And the numbers in this story exclude candidates for whom race/ethnicity are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> Among the 25 women running, only four are candidates of color — and three of them have very low odds of winning. So it’s likely that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michelle Lujan Grisham</a>, the incumbent governor of New Mexico, will be the only woman of color elected governor this year.</p>



<h2><strong>The outlook isn’t as good for women in Congress</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even though research shows that Americans are more comfortable with women serving in legislative roles, this year is not shaping up well for female congressional candidates. That’s particularly striking given how much progress women have made in recent years. In the 2018 midterm election, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/6/18119733/congress-diversity-women-election-good-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a record number of women were elected</a> to Congress, and following the 2020 election, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-record-number-of-republican-women-will-and-wont-change-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a record number of women were seated</a> in Congress, boosted by a record number of Republican women.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, it’s possible the number of women in Congress will hold steady — but it’s more likely that women’s representation will <em>decrease</em>. According to FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, there are 124 women running for House seats and six women running for Senate who have a 50-in-100 or greater chance of winning their race. If a woman won in all those races,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two races that feature two women candidates who each currently have a 50-in-100 chance of winning: Kansas’s 3rd District, with Republican Amanda Adkins and Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids; and the Alaska Senate race, with Kelly Tshibaka and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, both of whom are Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> there would still be 147 women in Congress, including the 19 female senators who are not up for reelection — the same number as now. But as the table below shows, a lot of those House candidates are in very close races.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Several vulnerable candidates are Democratic women who flipped seats in the 2018 election and are now facing strong challengers in a year when the environment is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable for Republicans</a>. Some of those women — like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/virginia/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia’s Rep. Elaine Luria</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s Rep. Susan Wild</a> — are running against other women, so even if they lose, another woman will take their place. But others, like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/iowa/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa Rep. Cindy Axne</a>, are running against men. And some Republican women are vulnerable too. For instance, Rep. Yvette Herrell of New Mexico <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-new-mexico-house-district-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipped her House seat in 2020</a> but is only <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-mexico/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly favored to win</a> against Democrat Gabriel Vasquez this fall.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s far from guaranteed that women will increase their numbers in Congress. If we narrow our criteria and look only at the women candidates who are likely to win their races — that is, the candidates with a 75-in-100 or greater chance of winning, according to the Deluxe forecast — the number of women in Congress shrinks to 135.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, counting the 19 female senators who are not up for reelection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> That would mean a substantial <em>reduction</em> in the number of women serving. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the reason for this situation is that a lot of women in both parties are running for seats where they have basically no chance of winning. According to the Deluxe forecast, 48 percent of all female House candidates and 30 percent of all female Senate candidates are running in seats where they have 50-in-100 or greater chance of winning.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes Kansas’s 3rd District and the Alaska Senate race, which each feature two women candidates with 50-in-100 chance of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> But 8 percent of female House candidates are running in seats where their chance of winning is between 10-in-100 and 49-in-100, and a whopping 44 percent of female House candidates and 60 percent of female Senate candidates are running in races where their chances of winning are 9-in-100 or less.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting, though, that this includes races such as the Alaska Senate race, where Democrat Patricia Chesbro, whose chance of winning is less than 1-in-100, is running against two other women, Kelly Tshibaka and Sen. Lisa Murkowski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are some party differences here. Democrats did a better job than Republicans of nominating women to run in competitive House races: Half of Democratic women running for House seats have a 50-in-100 or greater chance of winning, compared with 44 percent of Republican women. And a slightly greater share of Democratic women than Republican women are running in noncompetitive Senate races: More than half (62 percent) of Democratic women candidates for Senate are running in races where they have a 9-in-100 or less chance of winning, compared with 57 percent of Republican women candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The number of women of color in Congress could increase, though, depending on how some toss-up races turn out. Fifty-three female House candidates of color are running in races where they have at least a 50-in-100 chance of winning. An additional senator — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tammy Duckworth of Illinois</a> — falls into that same range of chance. So if all of those candidates win, the number of women of color in Congress would increase <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/women-color-elective-office-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from 49</a> to 54 — although, of course, not all of these candidates are guaranteed to win.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counting Sen. Mazie Hirono, who is Asian and is not up for reelection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a></p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Whatever happens, we’re clearly not heading for another banner year for women in Congress. Dittmar said that could be for a lot of reasons, including that several now-incumbent <a href="https://www.axios.com/2018/11/29/2018-midterm-elections-house-democrats-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women won competitive races in 2018</a> (and held on in 2020), which leaves more women to defend their seats this year. Democrats may also have been more reluctant to run in what would historically be considered a Republican year, she said, and this may have had a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to run as Democrats. And all of the focus on women’s victories in 2018 and 2020 may have created a false sense of parity, leading party leadership to focus less on elevating female candidates, she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Dittmar also cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from a single year. She pointed out that women’s successes in 2018 are visible in some of this year’s candidates — like Summer Lee, a progressive Democrat who is clearly favored to win the race for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 12th District</a>. Lee was elected to the Pennsylvania state Legislature in 2018 and won the nomination in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressives-democrats-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a competitive Democratic primary</a> earlier this year. Now, she’s poised to become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/us/politics/summer-lee-house-pa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Black congresswoman from Pennsylvania</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There are lots of different kinds of success stories for women — we shouldn’t just look at the topline numbers,” Dittmar said. “You look at young women of color who got out there and ran for office and, four years later, will be in Congress. We have to pay attention to those stories too.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In May, Anna Paulina Luna <a href="https://twitter.com/realannapaulina/status/1522383949791739905?s=20&amp;t=kVbLNHHOFL9pdC-m1nzRlA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donned a red-carpet-worthy ball gown</a> to a screening of “2000 Mules,” a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/07/texas-ken-paxton-2000-mules-sid-miller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debunked documentary</a> that falsely claims to show evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. In June, she made her stance on the 2020 election clear <a href="https://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20220602_020000_Field_Report_With_Paola_Ramos/start/120/end/180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with MSNBC</a>: “I believe that President Trump won that election, and I do believe that voter fraud occurred.” And in November, she will very likely be elected to Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Luna is the Republican candidate for Florida’s 13th District, on the Gulf Coast around St. Petersburg. During redistricting last year, Republicans redrew <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this previously competitive district to be much redder</a>, and as a result, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/florida/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luna has a 97-in-100 shot</a> at beating her Democrat opponent, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, as of Monday at 12 p.m. Eastern. (All numbers in this story are as of that same time and date.)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1312" height="1103" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.51.37-PM-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.51.37-PM-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.51.37-PM-1.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.51.37-PM-1.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Luna is one of well over a hundred of candidates running this fall who have denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are candidates who either clearly stated that the election was stolen from Trump, or took legal action to overturn the results, such as voting not to certify election results or joining lawsuits that sought to overturn the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> and have a strong chance of winning their race. Of the 185 Republican candidates running for House, Senate and governor’s seats who have denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, 124 — or 67 percent — are in races our forecast currently pins at “Solid R,” meaning they have a 95-in-100 or better chance of winning. Overall, a bigger share of election deniers are running in Solid R races than Republican candidates in general: Of the 496 Republican candidates running for House, Senate and governor, 225 — or 45 percent — are in Solid R races.<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We considered the viable candidates (i.e., those with at least a 10 percent chance of winning) for races in which more than one Republican was running for office in the general election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Election-denying candidates running to become House representatives are faring better than those running to be governor or Senator. There are 170 election deniers running for House seats, and 70 percent (119) are running in Solid R races. Among the seven running for governor, only two — Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and Idaho Gov. Brad Little — are running in Solid R races. And of the eight election deniers running for Senate, just three — Katie Britt in Alabama, Eric Schmitt in Missouri and Markwayne Mullin in Oklahoma’s special election — have better than 95-in-100 odds.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Most election deniers are likely to win their races" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XeZxM/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="240" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">A sizable portion of election-denying candidates are also running in races where they’re very <em>unlikely</em> to win. Thirty-six election-denying candidates, or 19 percent, are running in races that our forecast currently identifies as Solid D, giving them a 5-in-100 or worse shot at winning. This includes candidates such as Jeff Zink, the GOP candidate for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona’s 3rd Congressional District</a>. Zink has not only claimed the 2020 election was stolen; he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/23/us/jan-6-attendees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also participated in the Jan. 6 rally</a> that preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol, though he says he never entered the building. FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast gives Zink a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/arizona/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 1-in-100 chance</a> of winning.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, very few election deniers are running in toss-up races. Toss-up races are rarer in general — particularly as partisan redistricting <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-competitive-districts-near-extinction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creates fewer competitive districts</a> — but there are disproportionately fewer election deniers facing these kinds of odds than Republican candidates overall. Just four election-denying candidates (2 percent of all deniers) are running in races that are currently deemed toss-ups by our Deluxe forecast: Kari Lake, who’s running for governor in Arizona; Monica De La Cruz and Mike Garcia, who are running for House seats in Texas and California, respectively; and Senate candidate Adam Laxalt in Nevada. Comparatively, there are 17 Republicans running in toss-up races overall, or 3 percent of candidates. This might be due to Republican voters in competitive districts rejecting more extreme candidates in the primary in favor of a stronger general-election candidate, while voters in solid Democratic or Republican areas could afford to select more extreme candidates since it would have less impact in the general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Republican candidates who have accepted the legitimacy of the 2020 election are less likely than election deniers to be in Solid R races. Of the 67 Republican candidates who accept the 2020 election, 30 — or 45 percent — are running in races where they have 95-in-100 or better odds. This includes candidates such as North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, who is running for reelection and is <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1171/vote_117_1_00002.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the Republicans who voted to certify</a> the 2020 election results. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s still two weeks left before the election, and the forecast is updating constantly, so none of these results is set in stone. However, this snapshot shows that claiming the 2020 election was stolen doesn’t seem to preclude GOP candidates from winning elections this fall. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">“The polls are in crisis. Polling is dead.” We heard variations on <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/polling-catastrophe/616986/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this theme</a> after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat larger-than-average polling errors</a> in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. The reality, though, is that polls are still quite important <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-polling-on-the-issues-probably-isnt-as-broken-as-horse-race-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to understanding what the public thinks about different issues</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2330443X.2021.1971126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remain useful for forecasting elections</a>, as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast</a> is doing this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, the death of polling has been greatly exaggerated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t mean, however, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/24/opinion/frustrated-with-polling-pollsters-are-too.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there aren’t reasons to be worried</a> about the state of polling in 2022. One big concern is that we have fewer surveys of individual contests in 2022 than in previous midterms. And a larger share of that smaller pie has been conducted by partisan pollsters and/or sponsored by partisan organizations, based on an analysis of polls conducted from early May to late October in the 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022 midterm election cycles.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aggregated poll and poll sponsorship data across all races for the U.S. Senate, U.S. House (including the generic ballot) and governor in FiveThirtyEight’s database. We removed polls from the same pollster and sponsor(s) with overlapping dates to prevent overweighting them in the analysis. An individual survey by one pollster that asked questions about multiple races we’re interested in — such as one asking about a state’s Senate and governor race — is counted as separate polls when discussing the number of polls for Senate, House and governor races. Our analysis is based on polls whose final date in the field falls between 180 and 15 days from Election Day, which is the equivalent point in the election cycle for 2022 as of Oct. 24 at 2 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> As a result, we have less information about individual contests and are more reliant on polls that could be notably biased toward one party.</p>



<h2><strong>Fewer polls from a smaller number of pollsters</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Simply put, there have been way fewer polls in 2022 than in past cycles. In 2010, pollsters conducted almost 1,700 polls of individual races for Senate, House and governor between early May and late October. By comparison, we have slightly more than half that number this time around — about 900. But this dropoff isn’t sudden; it’s been a more gradual decline over the past decade and a half, as the chart below shows:</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="The number of midterm horse-race polls has been shrinking" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kgMaF/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the overall number of individual races polled has decreased, the number of polls of Senate, House and governors races has varied over these 12 years. This year, we have around 350 polls for both Senate and gubernatorial contests. Compared with 2018, that’s slightly fewer polls of Senate races and slightly more polls of governors races. Still, this is far less than the 500-plus surveys we had of both of those types of races in 2010 and 2014. Meanwhile, the number of House polls has ebbed and flowed since 2010: We only have about 200 House polls over the past six months, almost identical to 2014’s total, whereas we had more than 400 House polls in 2018 and more than 500 in 2010.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, as the number of surveys of races at the state or district level has fallen, the number of national polls that ask about the generic ballot — which asks respondents which party they plan to support in their local U.S. House election — has more than doubled in 2022. This could be down to a couple of factors: For one thing, <a href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/5004334/mod_resource/content/1/Jacobson%202015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics today</a> are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more nationalized</a> than in the past, so pollsters may be incentivized to conduct national surveys, which will get more clicks and views. And it’s also potentially more economical — and safer — to poll a national audience on different issues and the generic ballot — which, for instance, can produce multiple stories for a media organization — than to poll individual races at the state level. The former involves weighting polls by information about the national population, whereas state-level polls may require more difficult choices to properly interpret results, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/12/upshot/polling-midterms-warning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve consistently seen larger errors</a> in certain states than at the national level.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another factor in the decline of polling of individual contests? A smaller number of pollsters are conducting surveys — or at least, releasing results. Over the past six months or so, 150 different pollsters have surveyed Senate, House and gubernatorial elections, down from roughly 190 in 2018 and the smallest total for any midterm in our sample.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While concerning, this trend isn’t necessarily surprising. Polling <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-pollsters-have-changed-since-2016-and-what-still-worries-them-about-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has become</a> more expensive and more challenging, as the response rate to more traditional polling methods, like live telephone calls, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/upshot/midterms-polling-phone-calls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is sometimes below 1 percent</a>. Moreover, recent polling misses in 2016 and 2020 — note that 2018 polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were comparatively better</a> — may have also made major news organizations more hesitant to put themselves out there by releasing surveys of important statewide races. Meanwhile, up-and-comers <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2022/09/19/whats-going-on-with-trafalgars-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with more experimental</a> — and at times, less transparent — methodologies have increased their polling output.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, we’re getting more polls from potentially less reliable sources.</p>



<h2><strong>Partisan sources are releasing a larger share of polls</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because, compared with past cycles, polls in 2022 are more likely to be sponsored or associated with partisan sources. This is a problem because partisan polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to be more inaccurate</a> than polls conducted by or for nonpartisan groups. Internal polls, which are sponsored by candidates’ campaigns, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often try to spin</a> a certain narrative by showing their preferred candidate in a better position than what polls from nonpartisan sources are indicating. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polls page</a>, we denote whether a poll is sponsored by an organization that is considered partisan or is sponsored by a campaign.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations are considered partisan if they operate on behalf of a candidate, party, campaign committee, &lt;a href="https://www.fec.gov/press/resources-journalists/political-action-committees-pacs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PAC, super PAC, hybrid PAC&lt;/a&gt;, 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(6) organization that conducts a large majority of its political activity on behalf of one political party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>28</sup></a> When we looked at the share of partisan polls in 2022 and for previous midterms, we found that the percentage of polls in Senate, House and gubernatorial contests coming from partisan sources has reached new heights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="A larger share of polls are coming from partisan sources" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oi9mD/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, it’s not unusual to have a high percentage of partisan polls when looking solely at individual House races. House districts usually have smaller populations than states, so they tend to be harder to poll, which means campaigns often do much of the survey work in them. From 2010 to 2018, nearly half of all House polls came from campaigns or partisan groups. Yet that share has climbed to 54 percent this cycle amid a smaller number of overall House polls. Perhaps more disconcertingly, the share of Senate and gubernatorial surveys from partisan sources has risen to about one-third and one-quarter, respectively, even as the overall number of each is similar to 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conversely, we’re seeing a smaller number of horse-race polls conducted by or sponsored by “legacy media” outlets, which we broadly define as longstanding news sources with a major national reach.<a data-footnote-id="29" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would include major network and cable news outlets, national papers of record, wire services and prominent national news magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a> For instance, in 2010, legacy media sponsored and/or conducted 85 Senate polls and 64 governors polls between May and late October. But in the same span this year, the corresponding figures are just 25 Senate polls and 33 governors surveys.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This situation is perhaps best-illustrated by the rise of The Trafalgar Group, a Republican pollster <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/Polling-Methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that reaches respondents</a> in different ways by using a <a href="https://www.aapor.org/getattachment/Education-Resources/Reports/AAPOR-Mixed-Mode-Task-Force-Executive-Summary-FINAL.pdf.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mixed-mode approach</a>. This cycle, Trafalgar is tied for the most Senate polls conducted (23) and ranks second in gubernatorial surveys (25),<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes one poll Trafalgar conducted in conjunction with InsiderAdvantage, another pollster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>30</sup></a> after releasing only a handful of polls in the same period in 2018 (the pollster <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1322301003090268162?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became more prominent</a> in 2020). In both cases, Trafalgar is either tied with or just trails Emerson College, another mixed-mode pollster that has become prodigious over the past couple of election cycles — although Emerson is nonpartisan.</p>



<h2><strong>We’re flying blind in many House races</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">With fewer total surveys, fewer races have been polled — especially in the House. So far this cycle, we have polls from 96 districts, which represents only about one-fifth of the chamber and is far less polling than the almost 150 districts surveyed in 2018 and nearly 170 in 2010. However, that 96-district figure is a bit deceiving, because only about half of those districts have more than one poll, including races where the same pollster has released more than one. This is problematic not just for the 339 districts for which we have zero polls, but also for our forecast, which takes polling data from districts that have it and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infers numbers</a> for similar-looking districts that lack polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One silver lining, though, is that we have a decent amount of polling in competitive Senate and gubernatorial races. This year, we have an average of about 26 surveys in the eight Senate races rated somewhere from “lean Republican,” to “lean Democratic” by election handicappers at <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cook Political Report</a>, <a href="https://insideelections.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Elections</a> and <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a>, and an average of about 16 surveys in the eight highly competitive gubernatorial contests. That Senate figure is right in between the average number of polls in 2010 and 2014 (about 24 and 29, respectively), helped out in part by the fact that fewer Senate seats are in play this year. The gubernatorial figure is lower than 2010 or 2014 figures but is actually much better than 2018’s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, we have less polling in seemingly uncompetitive statewide races than in most recent midterm cycles, which could make it more likely that we miss a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/governor-maryland-surprise-brown-hogan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late-developing and potentially surprising result</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The state of polling is disconcerting. We have fewer polls, and a larger share of them come from partisan sources. We also have less information about House races, making race-to-race forecasting more perilous. All of this is a challenge for what we do at FiveThirtyEight, and we hope that pollsters and news organizations figure out how to offer the public greater polling information in the future.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For months, Democrats were defying midterm gravity. Now, it looks like they may be coming back down to earth.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost always does poorly in midterm elections</a>, and early in the year, it looked like that trend would hold true in 2022. But after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, Democrats experienced a boost in the polls. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The generic congressional ballot is a poll question that asks people nationwide which party they plan to vote for for Congress (without naming specific candidates). And as recently as Oct. 13, Democrats led by 1.1 percentage points in FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot polling average</a>. Now, however, Republicans lead in this polling average by 0.5 points,<a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All numbers in this article are as of Oct. 24 at 5:30 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a> suggesting the national mood has turned back toward the GOP. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This change has affected FiveThirtyEight’s midterm forecasts too. Democrats’ chances of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holding onto Senate control</a> have fallen from 66-in-100 on Oct. 13 to 55-in-100 today. And Republicans have gone from having a 69-in-100 chance of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipping the House</a> on Oct. 13 to an 80-in-100 chance today.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="808" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="916" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1-1.png" alt="Line chart of how each party's forecasted change of winning the House have changed over time, according to the FiveThirtyEight deluxe forecast. The latest forecast shows Republicans with a 80 in 100 chance to win the chamber, and Democrats with a 20 in 100 chance to win." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1-1.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1-1.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Republicans’ chances in the House have risen that high because the forecast expects the final margin to be even better for Republicans than the generic-ballot polls currently suggest. The forecast projects that, on average, Republicans will win the national popular vote for the House by 4.0 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How does the forecast get from 0.5 points to 4.0 points? For one thing, Democrats aren’t fielding a candidate in 23 House districts this year, so they won’t get any votes there. In comparison, there are only 14 districts where Republicans aren’t fielding a candidate. However, all the uncontested districts were already safe for the other party, so this shouldn’t affect the seat breakdown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, our average of generic-ballot polls includes polls of adults, registered voters and likely voters. But if you’re interested in who will win an election, you’re most interested in the polls of likely voters. And likely voter polls tend to be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better for Republicans</a> than the other two types. For example, if we were to calculate a generic-ballot polling average using only likely voter polls, Republicans would lead by 1.1 points, not 0.5. And here are the four most recent generic-ballot polls that have released numbers among both registered voters and likely voters:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, generic-ballot polling historically tends to get worse for the president’s party as the election approaches. The graph below shows how the FiveThirtyEight generic-ballot polling average<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculated retroactively for 2006, 2010 and 2014, since we only debuted the modern version of our generic-ballot average in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>32</sup></a> shifted in the last 90 days of the 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 midterms. As you can see, the president’s party lost ground in the final month of every year but 2018.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="The president's party tends to stumble in the home stretch" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/U5fBR/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we’re only two weeks away from Election Day, and millions of Americans have already <a href="https://rpubs.com/ElectProject/early_vote_2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted early or absentee</a>, but there is still time for polls to get better for Republicans. On average, in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018, the generic-ballot margin got 1.2 points worse for the president’s party in the final 15 days.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that doesn’t mean the Dobbs decision didn’t make a difference. Take another look at that graph. The 2022 line (along with the 2014 line) is at the very top of the chart. In other words, Democrats may lose ground from here on out, but they are starting from a higher baseline than usual. And without the boost Democrats received over the summer, we may have been forecasting a so-called “red wave” — a Republican landslide of 6-10 points. While the possibility of another polling error in Republicans’ favor means that outcome is still on the table, it’s more likely that 2022 will be a more modest Republican victory. For Democrats, it could have been a lot worse.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It was a question that befuddled <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/lessons-latino-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election prognosticators</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/05/931836590/how-texas-longtime-democratic-and-heavily-latino-county-flipped-red" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the media</a> in <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/04/joe-biden-texas-border-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Lone Star State</a>: How did then-President Donald Trump gain traction in or outright flip a sizable chunk of the 28 counties<a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewster, Brooks, Cameron, Culberson, Dimmit, Duval, El Paso, Frio, Hidalgo, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kinney, Kleberg, La Salle, Maverick, Nueces, Presidio, Reeves, Starr, Terrell, Val Verde, Webb, Willacy, Zapata and Zavala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>33</sup></a> along the Texas-Mexico border in 2020?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, two years ago, voters living along Texas’s border <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted rather substantially toward Trump</a>: He won 14 of Texas’s 28 border or South Texas counties — eight of which he flipped from 2016. And while President Biden still carried the region by 17 percentage points, this was about half the margin Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won in 2016. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/10/dccc-democrats-tx-15-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Although Democrats are bullish</a> on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/27/politics/latino-voters-texas-democrats-trump/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing these voters back into the fold</a> — or at least preserving their much-reduced advantage — that could prove challenging given that signs look promising for Republicans this year. In June, Republican Mayra Flores defeated Democrat Dan Sanchez <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/14/texas-special-election-tx-34-mayra-flores-dan-sanchez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a special election</a> in the state’s 34th District. Additionally, state Republicans have increased <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/05/gop-south-texas-local-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their outreach and recruitment efforts</a> in South Texas, and Republicans <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/blog/new-uttexas-politics-project-poll-abbott-maintains-45-40-lead-over-o%E2%80%99rourke-52-support-busing#Governor%E2%80%99s%20race:%20Trial%20ballots,%20attitudes%20toward%20candidates%20and%20key%20issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are largely trusted more</a> on many policy issues — like immigration and the economy — that are <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top of mind</a> for Latino voters, according to some polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while this year’s elections will offer clues about the durability of Republicans’ gains, the results won’t provide a definitive answer because the electoral environment this year <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally favors Republicans</a>. In turn, this might mean narrower margins for Democrats, versus outright losses for the them. The table below shows the three Texas districts in which our Deluxe forecast doesn’t see a clear favorite, and only one is a toss-up. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, even though redistricting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-congressional-map-could-give-a-huge-boost-to-gop-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved Democrats’ chances</a> in two of the districts highlighted above, they’re still on the defensive this year.<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other, Texas’s 15th District, moved slightly in Republicans’ favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> And they have good reason to be: Over the summer, Republicans have <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/16/south-texas-GOP-fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outraised their rivals</a> in all three districts, and the Cook Political Report recently moved their election ratings for <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1577668535425318912" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 15th and 34th Districts</a> toward the GOP. And as the chart above shows, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even our forecast</a> indicates that there’s a decent chance that Republicans will hold or flip one or more of these seats in the next Congress. So how did this region become more competitive, and what does Republicans’ electoral future there look like? Let’s dive in.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><p data-paragraph="main">Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-odds-controlling-congress-improved-fivethirtyeight-91887598</p>



<h2><strong>Republicans’ best chance for a flip</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to our forecast, Republicans’ best chance of gaining a congressional seat in South Texas is the now-open 15th District — which <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JR48I4oPAM_mTfeu8-EryAb3G5t3r6JUzKVoL40nbv4/edit#gid=1774019621" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump won by 3 points in 2020</a> — where Democrat Michelle Vallejo and Republican Monica De La Cruz <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/texas/15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are neck-and-neck.</a><a data-footnote-id="35" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-35" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our Deluxe forecast, as of this past Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>35</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Republicans, this race is reminiscent of 2020, when De La Cruz came <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-texas-house-district-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within less than 3 points</a> of unseating Rep. Vicente Gonzalez. This go-around, however, De La Cruz has more leverage. On top of the district getting redrawn to be more Republican-leaning, she has a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=TX15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive financial edge</a> as of late September, and Vallejo reportedly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/09/midterms-spending-candidates-democrats-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t getting much support</a> from the national party. (This stands in stark contrast to national Republicans, who have <a href="https://localtoday.news/tx/gop-targets-democrats-in-attack-ads-in-south-texas-congressional-elections-58195.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooded the airwaves</a> with TV ads attacking Vallejo for being too progressive.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Because of redistricting, this district was morphed into one that is definitely more conservative, so there is the sense among national Democrats that the 15th is doomed,” said <a href="https://webapps.utrgv.edu/aa/dm/#/user/andrew.smith" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Smith</a>, a political science professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. “As a result, the sentiment from the national party has been to put money toward other House races where they think Democrats have more of a chance.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this race is no slam dunk for De La Cruz. Throughout the year, the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/08/22/monica-de-la-cruz-ppp-pandemic-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican attracted</a> a number of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republican-house-texas/2022/01/12/5463aee8-72e1-11ec-8b0a-bcfab800c430_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative headlines</a>. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s9O-rnq9HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently</a>, Vallejo released a TV ad calling De La Cruz “too extreme” on abortion. That could hurt her in a district with a voting-age population that is 79 percent Hispanic, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight data</a>, since abortion continues to be an issue <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hispanic voters largely support</a>. Of course, the mudslinging has gone both ways, and Republicans’ attacks could land too. National GOP groups are trying to paint Vallejo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g64LUbi-6o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a radical</a>. In fact, one spot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvO7IoOiRQY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused the Democrat</a> of “hosting a border resistance event at her family business,” complete with “anarchist artwork” and calls to “smash ICE,” or the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond the political smears, politics and PAC money, this race will likely come down to which issues voters prioritize. Competitive districts often compel candidates <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-lose-when-we-lose-competitive-congressional-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to run toward the middle</a>, but <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/08/24/tx15-vallejo-de-la-cruz-2022-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither seems to be doing that</a>. Vallejo was <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/michelle-vallejo-progressive-rgv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruited to run for the seat by a local progressive organization</a> and has campaigned on a platform that included support for policies like “<a href="https://twitter.com/MichelleVforTX/status/1492218039932182535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medicare for All</a>” and a <a href="https://michellefortx15.com/platform-issues-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15 minimum wage</a>. Monica De La Cruz, meanwhile, hasn’t been shy about <a href="https://www.monicaforcongress.us/news/ehp5dng2dgrpybejfqkdjw1m0txgb3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her anti-abortion views</a>. She also <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-azfnsugtrg1583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has Trump’s support</a> and has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied, without evidence, the outcome of the 2020 election</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This race will definitely come down to the issues. Abortion, while not the main issue, is nonetheless motivating younger and more progressive Hispanics to turn up at the polls — which might help Vallejo. On the flip side, De La Cruz will certainly be able to pick up a lot of votes among the more religious and evangelical Christian voters because of her unapologetic anti-abortion stance,” Smith said. “So the question is, which of their candidacies is capturing the pulse more of what the majority voting population down here wants?”</p>



<h2><strong>Safer territory for Democrats</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both the 28th and 34th Districts in Texas lean more toward Democrats, so the focus here is mainly about how narrow of a race can Republicans make it, if they don’t win outright. In the race for the 34th, Gonzalez has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/texas/34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about a 2-in-3 chance</a> of besting Flores,<a data-footnote-id="36" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-36" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our Deluxe forecast, as of this past Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>36</sup></a> who is running for reelection following her victory in the special election this past June. Gonzalez currently represents the 15th District, but <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/news/legislature/article/South-Texas-Rep-Vicente-Gonzalez-switch-districts-16565817.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to run in the 34th</a> after his old district was made more competitive in redistricting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s working in the Democrat’s favor is that the 34th District is now much safer for Democrats than it was during Flores’s special election. That election was <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/14/texas-special-election-tx-34-mayra-flores-dan-sanchez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted under the old district lines</a>, which had a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+5<a data-footnote-id="37" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-37" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>37</sup></a> — meaning it was 5 points more Democratic than the country as a whole — but the new district has a partisan lean of D+17. And while we have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/house/2022/texas/34/?states=DE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very little polling</a> in this race, an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/house/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RMG Research/U.S. Term Limits survey</a> conducted July 23-Aug. 1 gave Gonzalez a 4-point edge among likely voters. Also, during the special election, Flores’s Democratic rival was <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/06/republicans-south-texas-special-election-tx-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly underfunded</a> and got little help from the national party; Gonzalez, though, has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/candidates?cycle=2022&amp;id=TX34&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a small advantage</a> over Flores when it comes to cash on hand, and he is receiving help from Democrats’ <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=TX34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national campaign spending arm</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this district could also be in play, according to Smith and <a href="https://twitter.com/CookPolitical/status/1577671762082516997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other forecasters</a> who have assessed the race as a toss-up. <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1580537015128707074" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican groups</a> are <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=TX34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting involved in the race</a>, and a super PAC affiliated with House Republican leadership has worked to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2VIdBXJOPE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paint Gonzalez</a> as out-of-touch with voters. Plus, Gonzalez comes with <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/08/19/vicente-gonzalez-property-tax-homestead-exemption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some baggage</a>, including an incident in July after his campaign paid for advertising on a political blog that used <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/07/19/mayra-flores-gonzalez-mchale-racist-1658251711/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist language</a> to describe Flores. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the three competitive districts this fall, arguably the easiest race for Democrats will be in the 28th District, where longtime Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar has roughly an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/texas/28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8-in-10 chance</a> of beating Republican Cassy Garcia.<a data-footnote-id="38" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-38" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our Deluxe forecast, as of this past Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>38</sup></a> There are many likely explanations for this. First, he’s <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=TX28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised much more money</a> overall than his rival. Also, the 28th District became slightly bluer in redistricting, going from a partisan lean of D+4 to D+7. But what could be helping Cuellar the most is that he’s no longer in the headlines for an FBI raid on his home and campaign office in January — at least <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/henry-cuellar-texas-representative-not-fbi-investigation-target/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared with how he was</a> around the time of his <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/19/henry-cuellar-jessica-cisneros-runoff-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive primary</a> — and subsequent runoff election — this spring. (Cuellar’s attorney has said he is not the target of the investigation.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, Cuellar will be a tough Democrat to beat, as evidenced by his roughly 18 years in Congress. His <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/cuellar-cisneros-texas-primary/607255/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-abortion, pro-gun rights views</a> and his <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigration-henry-cuellar-biden-border-enforcement-migrants-face-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tough-on-the-border</a> posture fits well with his culturally conservative seat, as made clear by how he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-texas-house-district-28.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sailed to reelection</a> in 2020, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-strongest-house-candidates-in-2020-were-mostly-moderate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outperforming Biden by 15 points</a>. And his <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/06/henry-cuellar-texas-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate views</a> could also make it harder for Republicans to call him radical. Still, Republicans have a somewhat competitive challenger in Garcia, a former staffer of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. In addition to <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1579569635326066688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7ZbrSr6NW0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national groups</a> rushing to <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1580537015128707074" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her defense</a>, Garcia has <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/04/house-republicans-fundraising-q3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised more than $1 million</a> in the third quarter of this year and has outraised Cuellar’s past GOP opponents, according to the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/house-rating-changes-schweikert-moves-toss-cuellar-lean-democrat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook Political Report</a>. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Altogether, these three races will likely be the biggest test of Texas <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-texas-race-and-ethnicity-hispanics-greg-abbott-ef360d047377a8ff1a67e19ce8863251" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans’ durability on the Texas border</a>. But it won’t answer <em>all</em> the questions about how much support they’ve siphoned away from Democrats: For one thing, the electoral environment favors Republicans this year. On top of that, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/politics/latino-voters-texas-15th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar economic concerns</a> that benefitted Trump in 2020 still seem to be in play. And immigration is arguably <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/12/texas-border-security-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more salient now</a> for South Texans more so than it was two years ago as the number of migrant encounters at the state’s southern border <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/28/greg-abbott-border-migrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has increased</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The districts are important symbolically as well, and both parties will be watching closely to see what happens. “If Republicans win or come extremely close to winning in any of these districts, I think the party will take it as a sign that their strategy — pouring in money, animating immigration-related issues and so forth — is starting to bear fruit,” Smith said. “In any case, though, I think this region is far more competitive than in the past, and I do think you’re going to see more Republican efforts to make the Lower Rio Grande Valley, if not red, then at least purple going forward.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Welcome to Invisible Divides, a series exploring the profound differences in worldview between Democrats and Republicans. These beliefs about education, religion, gender, race and political extremism align with partisanship — but run much deeper. Differences like these don’t just influence the ways Democrats and Republicans vote, but also how they think about their place in America. And they help explain why opposing views on important issues today seem increasingly irreconcilable.</em></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When Dale Nicholls started college in 1984, he soon realized books weren’t for him. So he entered the workforce, started a job as a truck driver and eventually worked his way up to owning and running his own trucking company. His professional experience, he said, taught him more than what he’d have been able to learn in school. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A lot of the degrees people are getting, there’s no use for them in the real world, and so you’re finding a lot of people come out of college and then can’t get a job because their degrees are no good,” he said in an interview with FiveThirtyEight.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nicholls, now 60, doesn’t believe that everyone should go to college no matter how much it costs and no matter how much debt students take on. This belief puts him on one side of a deep and growing divide in the American electorate regarding attitudes about higher education and its value. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight has <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/538-PerryUndem-YouGov-Survey_Topline-Results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with PerryUndem and YouGov</a> to survey likely voters on how deep these types of fissures run.<a data-footnote-id="39" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-39" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted Aug. 10-21, 2022, among 1,796 likely voters, including oversamples of Black, Latino and Asian American/Pacific Islander respondents. Likely voters included registered voters who said that they are “almost certain to” or will “probably” vote in the November midterm elections. The sample was weighted to match the general population. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>39</sup></a> In this first installment of our series exploring the invisible divides in America — the differences in worldview that shape <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/538-regression-placeholder.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how people vote and think about their place in America</a> — we look at the education divide. For the past two decades, a voter’s level of education has become an increasingly important predictor in how he or she votes. But we found that the divide is about more than just the level of education someone has: Americans have diverging attitudes about the role higher education itself plays in American society. Like other divides we’ll be exploring, they help explain why Republicans and Democrats seem unable to find common ground on so many issues.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Since the late 1990s, college-educated voters <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been moving</a> towards the Democratic Party while voters without a college degree have become more decidedly Republican-leaning. By the time former President Barack Obama left office, those lines had solidified: A majority of college-educated voters identified as Democrats, while a majority of voters without a college degree identified as Republicans. In the 2016 election, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/even-among-the-wealthy-education-predicts-trump-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education was a better predictor</a> of who voted for former President Donald Trump than income.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Voters are split on whether college is good for society" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8g6Av/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="593" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">As this divide deepened, views on higher education <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/08/19/the-growing-partisan-divide-in-views-of-higher-education-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became even more partisan</a>. That has influenced how politicians talk about higher education, as well as their policy approaches to it. During his administration, Trump not only launched attacks on colleges, especially those he deemed elite — despite himself having graduated from the University of Pennsylvania — but began accusing them of spreading liberal propaganda. “Too many Universities and School Systems are about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education,” <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/10/trump-accuses-colleges-radical-left-indoctrination-threatens-tax-exemption/5415908002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he wrote on Twitter in 2020</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the FiveThirtyEight/PerryUndem/YouGov survey — which Nicholls participated in — 51 percent of respondents agreed with the idea that “a college education is the best way to get ahead in the U.S.” But agreement differed significantly by respondent’s partisan affiliations: Seventy-one percent of self-identified Democrats agreed while 37 percent of self-identified Republicans did. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Respondents were also asked a series of questions to gauge how they felt about higher education. Fifty-seven percent of respondents disagreed with the statement “college makes you lose common sense,” while 37 percent agreed. Of those who agreed, 65 percent planned to “definitely” vote for the Republican candidate in the upcoming midterms, while 12 percent of those who agreed planned to “definitely” vote for the Democratic candidate.<a data-footnote-id="40" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-40" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked who they would vote for in the upcoming elections for the U.S. House of Representatives if they were held next week. Other options included “probably the Democrat,” “probably the Republican,” “other,” “I’m not sure,” “I wouldn’t vote” and skipping the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>40</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More than 4 in 5 Republicans agreed with the statements that “most college professors teach liberal propaganda” and “high schools are trying to teach liberal propaganda,” compared with 17 and 16 percent of Democrats, respectively. Those who agreed with one of these statements generally also agreed with the other (90 percent). There weren’t huge differences in how people answered these questions based on level of education (except for people with postgraduate degrees). Instead, it was partisanship that mattered. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/american-turning-point-politics-public-education-91859671</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Voters’ views on college often aligned with how they’d respond to other, seemingly unrelated questions. Those who agreed with statements like “college makes you lose common sense,” were less likely to think climate change (35 percent) and racism or racial inequality (40 percent) were problems than those who disagreed (both 85 percent),<a data-footnote-id="41" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-41" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked how big of a problem they viewed each topic from a list of 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>41</sup></a> and less likely to think that high school students should learn about sexism and gender inequality (32 percent) and systemic racism (28 percent).<a data-footnote-id="42" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-42" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked whether they thought students in high school should learn about each topic from a list of eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>42</sup></a> They were also more likely to think inflation and the national economy would be worse a year from now, independent of their household income levels, according to analysis by Duncan Gans, a senior research analyst with PerryUndem. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This hints that the division is about more than simply getting a college education or having a higher income. “College” and, relatedly, “elitism” are concepts that seem to be linked to otherwise unrelated ideas — like support for LGBTQ+ rights or racial justice — which have, in turn, become associated with the identity of the Democratic Party. Increasingly, it seems that when politicians like Trump rail against the elite — a word that might otherwise mean a level of wealth and power he, himself, has — it’s meant as a cultural designation, not a socioeconomic one. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sharon Martin, who is 71 and lives in Virginia, participated in an online focus group as part of our poll. “I believe the young people go into college to get an education but instead are taught how to think as a group,” she wrote. “They are taught, or should I say instructed, by professors that I believe are pushing their ideals and desires.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jim Burke, a 61-year-old from Pennsylvania who spoke with FiveThirtyEight after taking part in the survey, agreed. He’s a pharmacist who went to a Catholic college and became conservative after having children. “My daughter went to college as a staunch Republican and she came out a liberal Democrat,” he said. “Totally due to her education.” (In 2020, voters under 30 were the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-lost-the-support-of-young-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Democratic-leaning age group</a>, although this age group is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/upshot/youth-voting-2020-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to vote than older groups</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s easy enough to see how this divide manifests in American society, as concern over what is taught in colleges has also trickled down to lower levels of education. Over the past two years, PEN America <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tj5WQVBmB6SQg-zP_M8uZsQQGH09TxmBY73v23zpyr0/edit#gid=1505554870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been tracking laws</a> that aim to prevent public college professors and primary and secondary education teachers from teaching “divisive” concepts, which may include racism, sexism or gender identity. Fourteen states have passed such laws, but bills have been introduced across the country. States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/us/politics/transgender-laws-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have also passed laws restricting</a> LGBTQ+ students’ access to school sports and health care and <a href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned school libraries from carrying books</a> on subjects deemed controversial. This fall, a Pennsylvania school district <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-cybersecurity/2022/09/26/culture-wars-take-aim-at-stem-education-00058782" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled the “Girls Who Code” book series</a>, meant to encourage girls of color to enter careers in tech. Across the country, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/01/gop-arizona-school-superintendent-seat-00048792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/09/culture-wars-take-center-stage-in-tudor-dixons-education-proposals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/republicans-2022-elections-critical-race-theory-education-culture-wars-scalise-2021-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates</a> have made battles over what’s taught in schools central to their campaigns.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan has illuminated the depths of this anti-elitism divide. In September, about a month after Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his plan</a> to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for certain borrowers, 22 Republican governors sent him a letter asking him to withdraw the plan. They <a href="https://www.rga.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Joint-Governors-Letter-Opposing-the-Biden-Student-Loan-Forgiveness-Plan-9-12-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued it</a> “rewards the rich and punishes the poor” by taxing hourly workers who hadn’t gone to college just to benefit higher earners who had. (Of course, not everyone who owes student loans is a higher earner — the U.S. Department of Education estimates that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87 percent of the debt</a> cancellation benefits will go to those who earn less than $75,000 annually.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not surprising that polls show voters divided on student loan forgiveness by party. In a <a href="https://civiqs.com/reports/2022/8/31/report-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-divides-americans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Kos/Civiqs Poll from August</a>, right after Biden’s plan was announced, 88 percent of Republicans and 56 percent of independent voters disapproved, while 88 percent of Democrats approved. A <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3854" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University poll</a>, also from the end of August, found that 81 percent of Republicans disapproved while 88 percent of Democrats approved. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Rachel Fishman, the acting director with the Education Policy program at New America, said there are partisan divides on whether the government should be funding colleges and universities at all. New America’s <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/reports/varying-degrees-2022/findings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual report</a> measuring attitudes about higher education found this year that 77 percent of Democrats thought the government should be more responsible for funding higher education, while 63 percent of Republicans said students should be more responsible. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You can kind of piece together from there how the subsequent answers on questions about funding and value kind of fall into place from that notion,” Fishman said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the New America survey, Republicans viewed attending college as something students themselves benefit from, but did not necessarily see <em>colleges</em> as something that benefited communities or the country as a whole. This could have implications for many battles to come, as Democrats want to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/house-democrats-unveil-higher-education-plan-to-lower-college-costs/2019/10/14/9c8aedb6-eed2-11e9-89eb-ec56cd414732_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase federal funding</a> for higher education and make at least some colleges free, while Republicans are more focused on <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/09/foxx-plans-for-vigorous-higher-ed-bill-next-year-00056530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaling back student loan forgiveness</a> and on <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/heres-the-long-list-of-topics-republicans-want-banned-from-the-classroom/2022/02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">curriculum battles</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It could also matter for bigger questions, like whether high school graduates should have equal access to higher education regardless of their ability to pay; whether and how to fund alternatives to colleges and universities; how to best prepare students for higher education; and whether research led by academic institutions is trusted. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, it’s becoming clearer that some voters think higher education institutions are actually bad for the country. “As much good as I think they do, I think they do as much harm,” Burke said. “The one thing that they do do well is they … make the kids think. Unfortunately, that thinking is guided to a specific point, and not just open ended.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The Senate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started out as a toss-up</a> when we launched our forecast in June — and after a summer in which political developments <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly played to Democrats’ favor</a>, there is now clear movement back toward Republicans. The FiveThirtyEight Senate forecast gives Democrats a 58 percent chance of keeping control of the Senate, down from a peak of 71 percent last month.<a data-footnote-id="43" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-43" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All forecast odds and polling average figures are as of Thursday, Oct. 20, at 5:30 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>43</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How to translate a roughly 60 percent chance into words is a tricky one, since it’s right on the threshold where you might choose to emphasize that one party is ahead <em>or</em> that it’s pretty close to 50-50. Poker players use the term “<a href="https://www.pokervip.com/poker-terms/flip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flip</a>” (short for “coin flip”) when two hands have about an equal chance of winning, even if the chances aren’t <em>exactly</em> equal. Most players would describe <a href="http://twodimes.net/poker/?g=h&amp;b=&amp;d=&amp;h=Ac+Ks%0D%0ATd+Th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this poker hand</a> as a “flip,” for instance, even though the pair of 10s would win 57 percent of the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In politics, the similar term “toss-up” is often applied, although the definition is fuzzy. We’re even inconsistent in how we use it ourselves.<a data-footnote-id="44" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-44" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longstanding “official” FiveThirtyEight definition of a toss-up is a race where both parties have less than a 60 percent chance of winning, although in some of the text that the forecast interactive autogenerates, we’ve used a 55 percent threshold instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>44</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But let’s get real. If a friend asked me to characterize the Senate race, I’d say “it’s pretty fucking close,” and emphasize that neither party has much of an advantage. Here’s why.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one thing, as of Thursday afternoon, Republicans realized a slight lead (of 0.1 percentage points) in the FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot average</a> for the first time since Aug. 2. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="900" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-711-2.png" alt="A line chart showing voter preferences on the generic ballot, with Republicans leading by one-tenth of a percentage point as of Thursday, Oct. 20, 2022." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-711-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-711-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-711-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="900" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-335-2.png" alt="A line chart showing voter preferences on the generic ballot, with Republicans leading by one-tenth of a percentage point as of Thursday, Oct. 20, 2022." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-335-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-335-2.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/generic-ballot-polls-335-2.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Obviously, a lead of a tenth of a percentage point isn’t much. The advantage may have flipped back by the time that you’re reading this. But the tied generic ballot overstates the case for Democrats. That’s because our <em>polling average</em> takes generic ballot polls as they come, which are a combination of polls of likely voters, registered voters and all adults. Our <em>model</em>, however, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takes an additional step</a> and adjusts polls of registered voters and adults to make them more similar to polls of likely voters, which this year have been more favorable to Republicans. So a tie on the generic ballot among all polls translates to a slight GOP lead with the likely voter adjustment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><p data-paragraph="main">Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-odds-controlling-congress-improved-fivethirtyeight-91887598</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Something else that’s made this year’s forecast hard to convey in plain English is that there are three entirely plausible scenarios: A Republican sweep of Congress, a Democratic sweep or a split Congress (which would more likely involve a Democratic Senate and a GOP House, rather than the other way around). Until recently, a split Congress had the most likely of the three scenarios, though the chances of this outcome were under 50 percent. Now, however, a GOP sweep (41 percent) is more likely than a split (38 percent):</p>

This is a complicated subject; I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>mostly</em> think</a> the model does a good job of accounting for this, and one should keep in mind there’s also the possibility that the polls could be biased <em>against</em> Democrats. But I’m <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not entirely confident</a>, so my mental model is slightly more favorable to the GOP than the FiveThirtyEight forecast itself. It’s worth noting, though, that some of the states where people had been most concerned about the polls being wrong, such as Wisconsin and Ohio, have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown a shift</a> toward the GOP <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in recent weeks</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the main reason why I think of the race for control of the Senate as a toss-up — rather than slightly favoring Democrats — is because there’s been steady movement toward the GOP in our model over the past few weeks. In principle, past movement <em>shouldn’t</em> predict future movement in our forecast and it should instead <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/random-walk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resemble a random walk</a>. (We put a lot of effort in our modeling into trying to minimize <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/autocorrelation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autocorrelation</a>.) This year, though, the forecast has moved in a predictable-seeming way, with a long, slow and steady climb toward Democrats over the summer, and now a consistent shift back toward Republicans.</p>

It’s hard to know whether it reflects the real state of the race or is an artifact of how our model works. The summer produced an unusual streak of favorable developments for Democrats, from the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-republican-outsiders-have-made-their-mark-this-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backlash to the Supreme Court’s decision</a> to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/13/business/us-gas-prices-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower gas prices</a>, to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-trumps-presence-in-the-midterms-is-risky-for-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump’s unhelpful involvement</a> in the midterms, to a string of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-could-the-inflation-reduction-act-save-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislative victories for President Biden</a>. There is, of course, a tendency to see patterns in random noise, but it’s as though the coin really did come up heads for Democrats six or seven times in a row.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From a modeling standpoint, another challenge is that Democrats were defying political gravity. The president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically performs poorly in the midterms</a>. There <em>have been</em> some exceptions and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there <em>is</em> some reason to think this year may be one of them</a>. But the model has been trying to balance polls showing Democrats having a pretty good year against its prior expectation that the electoral environment should be poor for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the election nears, the model relies on its priors less and trusts the polls more, so it was initially skeptical of buying into a post-Dobbs surge for Democrats. Right about the time the model had fully priced in Democrats’ improved polling, though, the news cycle shifted toward a set of stories that were more favorable for Republicans, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/22/23365868/desantis-marthas-vineyard-migrants-midterms-border" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/business/economy/high-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed concerns about inflation</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible to overstate the case for Republican momentum. Midterm elections <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/betting-markets-are-treating-the-midterm-elections-like-its-a-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend not to turn on a dime</a> in the way that presidential elections sometimes do. And there haven’t been any self-evidently important developments in the news cycle in the past week or so. If you’re one of those people who thinks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/18/gas-prices-election-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gas prices are all-determining of election outcomes</a>, they’ve <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even started to come down again slightly</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather, this is more a case of now having more evidence to confirm that the Democrats’ summer polling surge wasn’t sustainable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t mean it was fake: In fact, Democrats had a string of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent special election and ballot referendum results</a> in which they met or exceeded their polling. If you’d held the midterms in late August, I’d have bet heavily on Democrats to win the Senate. It sure would be nice to have another special election or two now, and to see how these polling shifts translate into real results. Polls can sometimes change for reasons that don’t reflect the underlying reality of the race, such as because of <a href="https://moeblog.substack.com/p/pollings-new-problem-partisan-non" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan nonresponse bias</a> or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-some-pollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pollster herding</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And certainly, Democrats have plenty of paths to retain the Senate. Republicans don’t have any sure-fire pickups; Nevada is the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely</a>, and even there, GOP chances are only 53 percent, according to our forecast. Meanwhile, Democrat John Fetterman is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still ahead in polls of Pennsylvania</a>, although his margin over Republican Mehmet Oz has narrowed. The model is likely to be quite sensitive to new polling in Pennsylvania going forward. If Democrats gain a seat there, meaning that the GOP would need to flip two Democratic-held seats to take the chamber, that starts to become a tall order. Nevada, sure, but I’m not sure Republicans would want to count on Herschel Walker in Georgia or Blake Masters in Arizona.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the bottom line is this: If you’d asked me a month ago — or really even a week ago — which party’s position I’d rather be in, I would have said the Democrats. Now, I honestly don’t know.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Welcome to </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/voices-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Voices Of Color</em></strong></a><em>, a column that explores what’s on the minds of voters of color in this year’s midterm elections.

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>We want to explore their views on politics, policy, the future of our democracy, our two-party system and everything in between. We hope that this column offers fresh perspectives from the minds of those whose political opinions are often overlooked or</em><em> </em><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>assumed</em></a><em>. </em><em>If you think you might be a good fit for this column,</em><em> </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-you-a-voter-of-color-we-want-to-hear-from-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>fill out this form</em></a><em> </em><em>— we might get in touch.</em></p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Meet Luke Bay, a Korean American Californian who once considered himself a “hardcore pro-life, pro-second Amendment, Jesus-loving patriotic Christian.” Years later, the 43-year-old now describes himself as a “patriotic, atheist, socialist” who is pro-choice, supports single-payer healthcare and wants to repeal the Second Amendment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then there’s Syed Fahim, a Pakistani American who lives in Pennsylvania. “I am a rare outlier because I’m a Muslim American, the son of two immigrants and a naturalized citizen myself. But I’m still a strong supporter of the Republican Party,” he told me. While Fahim <em>did</em> vote against former President Donald Trump in 2020, he typically supports GOP candidates in down-ballot races — and plans to stick with that tradition this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Asian American voters like Bay and Fahim are part of a group with growing political power. According to a recent analysis by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/10/12/key-facts-about-asian-american-eligible-voters-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pew Research Center</a>, more than 13.3 million Asian Americans are projected to be eligible to vote in 2022 — up 9 percent from the last midterm cycle in 2018. Under that broad umbrella are a range of ethnic identities with different political leanings: For example, while <a href="https://socialinnovation.ucr.edu/news/2020/08/18/latest-polling-data-shows-indian-americans-continue-lean-towards-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Americans</a> tend to strongly favor Democrats, Vietnamese Americans <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2020/11/10/misled-and-misinformed-why-vietnamese-voters-make-up-the-largest-asian-demographic-in-favor-of-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more evenly divided between Democrats and the GOP</a>. On the whole, however, Asian Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/10/12/key-facts-about-asian-american-eligible-voters-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically lean Democratic</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Most Asian Americans support the Democratic candidate in congressional races" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vgkEY/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="438" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">To that end, I wanted to see what was on the minds of five Asian American voters in the weeks leading up to this year’s midterm elections. Of course, as was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-5-latino-voters-are-thinking-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the case with Latino Americans</a>, I knew that I couldn’t paint this group with a broad brush. These voters’ policy preferences and concerns about the country are varied (as the interviews below show), and survey research backs this up, too. According to the <a href="https://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AAVS-2022-Embargoed-7-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Asian American Voter Survey</a>, Filipino Americans were the group most likely to say that immigration, inflation and health care were “extremely important” in deciding how they’d vote in November, while Indian Americans were the group most likely to prioritize gun control. Vietnamese Americans, meanwhile, were the ethnic group most likely to say foreign policy in Asia was extremely important in deciding how they’d cast a ballot.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But these voters’ clout will likely be felt most in just a few states. In its analysis, Pew estimated that in terms of raw numbers, most Asian Americans reside in California, New York, Texas, Hawaii and New Jersey. But their electoral weight varies — for example, in Hawaii, because it’s a small state, Asian American voters make up more than half of eligible voters. And although 32 percent of the country’s Asian American electorate lives in California, Asian Americans make up about 16 percent of the state’s eligible voters there. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Asian Americans are generally a highly politically engaged group. (<a href="https://apiavote.org/policy-and-research/asian-american-voter-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than two-thirds</a> of Asian American registered voters said that they planned to vote this midterm cycle.) But political parties don’t always treat them that way: Per this year’s Asian American Voter Survey, 52 percent of respondents said they haven’t been contacted by the Democratic Party in the past year, while 60 percent say they haven’t been contacted by the Republican Party. One frustration I heard in my conversations, too, was that Asian Americans are often treated as one bloc versus individual, unique communities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Both parties tend to think that Asian American voters vote uniformly,” said Rohan Vaidya, a 24-year-old Indian American living in Texas. “The way this manifests is through political outreach because you can tell that certain outreach isn’t targeted toward the specific concerns of Asian American voters. Instead, it’s based on assumptions about how this massive community as a whole will vote.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: What are the most important issues to you heading into the midterm elections?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Syed Fahim (31, Pakistani American, Pennsylvania, Republican): The No. 1 issue for me is the economy. I’ve seen the prices of everything around me go up — whether it’s gas, food or groceries. Although I am what many would consider upper middle-class, I’ve still had to budget and cut back on some quality of life expenditures, like vacations or the purchasing of other leisure goods and services.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tiansang Sylverne (38, Asian American, Illinois, Democrat): I generally care about social issues more than fiscal issues. So after the Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade, abortion access is now very important to me. Gun control is, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Luke Bay (43, Korean American, California, independent): Gun control and health care. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rohan Vaidya (24, Indian American, Texas, independent): Health care, the economy and preserving the health of our democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kylin Beeson (31, Chinese American, Washington, Democrat): Abortion access is very important. Even though abortion is legal where I live, I still think this is a relevant issue and that it should be legal for women everywhere. Addressing climate change is also top of mind for me. I’d really like to see more politicians who promote policies and actions toward that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: </strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/22/999345393/the-growing-power-of-the-aapi-vote-by-the-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Polling suggests</strong></a><strong> that Asian American voter turnout spiked in 2020. Were you especially motivated to vote that year? And are you planning to vote in the 2022 midterm elections?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sylverne: I was very motivated to vote in 2020. I think a lot of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters like myself were tired after enduring four years under Donald Trump and were ready to vote him out of office. I personally had many issues with him, including the fact that I think he’s not ethical and lacks morals. I’m also planning on voting in this year’s midterm elections, but I wouldn’t say I’m more motivated than I was in prior years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: As I’ve gotten older, I’ve learned that voting is a privilege, so voting in 2020 was very important to me — as is voting this year. While voting <em>is</em> a constitutional right, there are so many ways in which people’s right to vote is being restricted or is made more difficult. As a result, I don’t take voting for granted. I take voting seriously and want to make sure that my voice is heard.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Do you see Asian Americans more as one distinct group or as a set of different ethnic and racial groups?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I think we’re very diverse, with very diverse viewpoints. As a Pakistani American and practicing Muslim, my concerns are probably very different from those of, say, people of Eastern Asian descent — whether they be Chinese, Vietnamese or Korean American. So I view us not as a monolith, but as a range of many different ethnicities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: Asia is such a huge continent with many different cultures. As a Korean American, I know that I have completely different experiences from other Asian Americans. My family came here — through a green card program for nurses that my mom qualified for — seeking new opportunities. And the struggles they faced in life are different from the ones that other Asian Americans suffered. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I definitely see us as a mix of different ethnic and racial groups and not as a homogeneous voting bloc. We come from so many different counties and all have different experiences. For example, I’m an Asian American adopted from China, and I currently live in a very rural, predominantly white neighborhood. So the things that affect me are different from the things that affect Asian Americans who live in urban areas or someone who has just come into the United States. I think everyone’s experience is unique and different, so you can’t make broad generalizations about Asian Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: </strong><strong>Do you identify more as an Asian American or as a member of a specific Asian American ethnic or racial group?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I identify more with a specific subset of the Asian American community, which is Pakistani or South Asian American.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sylverne: I identify more with Asian Americans in general. I’m Chinese, but I don’t know if there’s a huge difference between Chinese Americans and Korean Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: If people ask, I’m Korean American first. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: I personally identify more with being Indian American than I do with being Asian American.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I would normally say Asian American, but if someone asks me my specific ethnic or racial background, I’d say Chinese American. I don’t know if I feel strongly toward either, though.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Do your values align more with the Republican Party or Democratic Party? Does your racial and ethnic identity affect your political views? If so, how?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: Socially, I’m more inclined to support the Republican Party. My wife and I are both practicing Muslims, so our religious and social values tend to skew more toward the right. When it comes to things like health care, however, we tend to skew more to the left. But I don’t think my racial and ethnic identity affects my politics, per se. I don’t think that being of a certain race or religion predisposes me to one political party over the other. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: I used to be a super hardcore right-winger. But during the Obama presidency, the hypocrisy of the right started popping up and showing its ugly face. I started to realize, “Hey, these people don’t even like me as a person.” Plus, later on in life I did a lot of traveling and that opened my eyes up to things touted by Democrats — like universal health care and universal access to education. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But I think what really made me turn away from Republicans is what happened when my dad was diagnosed with cancer. At this point, his business had already failed and he was scraping by making a living as a roofer. When he needed help with his health care, the U.S. wouldn’t do anything. He got lucky enough to go back to Korea and get health care there as an American citizen, but Missouri, where we were living at the time, didn’t approve him for treatment until after he passed away. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I do think that my racial and ethnic identity affects my politics now. It seems like the Republican Party doesn’t want immigrants here and that they don’t even see us as real people. Democrats have their own issues with how they treat Asians, but at least they’ll say that I’m welcome to be here. I just see more racist crap from Republicans than I do [from] Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: I’d say that my values have become more aligned with the Democratic Party over time. My racial and ethnic identity plays a role in the sense that I don’t feel as though the Republican Party adequately represents the interests of the Indian American community or the Asian American community at large.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Americans are very concerned about the economy and inflation. Have these issues personally affected you, and will they affect who you vote for this fall? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I work in a community health setting where I serve people who either have no insurance or are on Medicaid, so I interact with the most vulnerable in our society in terms of having access to health care. I know that they’re affected way more than I am by inflation and price increases, but I’ve felt the effects of inflation, too, even at my income level. Like I said, we did have to cut back a bit on some leisure spending. That said, I already intended to vote [for Republicans] this November, and I don’t see that changing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sylverne: Everyone can see the gas prices rising and prices in grocery stores increasing, but this is a global issue. It’s not just happening in America. But, in general, fiscal issues are just not as important to me when it comes to who I vote for.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: The economy and inflation are definitely top issues for me headed into the midterms. Inflation has affected me because buying things like food or consumer goods has become more expensive, which puts a strain on my finances. Still, as far as voting goes, the economy and inflation don’t impact my vote this fall insofar as they’re not the main bases on which I’m voting. So, while the economy is important, it doesn’t necessarily override other policy concerns that I have.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I definitely feel the impact of inflation, especially when I’m grocery shopping or going to the gas station. I’ve felt like I should cut back on my spending and be more conservative about not buying things that I don’t really need. But I wouldn’t say inflation is going to affect my vote. I still think I’m going to vote for Democrats this fall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are there certain policy issues on which you trust one party more than the other? If so, what are they? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: When it comes to gun rights and tax policy, I think the Republican Party reflects my values more closely. But in terms of things like foreign policy, health care and abortion access (but only for the life or health of the mother or in cases of rape or incest), I tend to agree more with the Democratic Party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sylverne: On abortion access, gun control, environmental issues and preserving our democracy, I trust Democrats more. But with fiscal issues, it’s hard to tell. I don’t agree with the trickle-down economics approach that Republicans have adopted, but I don’t agree with all of Democrats’ economic policies, either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: In regards to women’s health, the economy, climate change, marijuana legalization at the national level and criminal justice issues, I trust Democrats more. But that’s probably all just bias. Lately, I feel such disgust for most Republicans because of their policies and attitudes these days, so I can’t say that there are policy issues where I trust their judgment more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Have you noticed a lurch either to the left or right among Asian American voters within your community? Has your political ideology changed over the last few years? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I’ve noticed that people in my community tend to skew left. And with the election of Trump in 2016, I’ve seen that accelerate more and more — even among my friends and people in my age range. In regards to myself, however, I would say that, in the last few years, I’ve moved more to the right. When someone goes out of their way to oppose you and your views, it makes you more defensive and dig in a little bit more to the positions that perhaps weren’t so hard and fast before. At least, that’s how I am personally.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: People here have moved a little toward the right, particularly on guns and law and order issues, because of the attacks that happened to Asian people as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. My sisters live in New York, and they even tell me they’re afraid to go outside sometimes. And I know in Southern California, where I live, that a lot of Asians have bought guns for protection. So in that sense, they’re more on Republicans’ side when it comes to guns, but it’s mainly so they can protect themselves. My political ideology hasn’t changed in the last few years, though.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: In my estimation, younger Indian Americans and younger Asian American voters still seem very tied to the Democratic Party. But I have seen older Asian American voters, particularly middle-aged men in my community, move toward the Republican Party in recent years. But that’s just my anecdotal experience. As for myself, I’d say that my political ideology has definitely changed. A few years ago, I might have described myself as a Republican-leaning independent, and now I would say I’m a Democratic-leaning independent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Were you affected by discrimination as a result of COVID-19 pandemic? And if so, has that affected your vote previously — and will it affect your vote this year? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: No, I wasn’t personally affected by any discrimination related to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this point in time, COVID-19 and its after-effects have almost no effect at all on determining who I would vote for in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: Fortunately, I wasn’t the target of any discrimination, but I know people of Asian descent who were either the targets of racist comments or were actively threatened in public places. Personally, discrimination as a result of the pandemic won’t affect <em>my</em> vote this November, but I know many people who say they’ll be voting differently this year as a result of the discrimination they suffered throughout the pandemic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I experienced some microaggressions early on. For example, I would go to the grocery store and people would not want to stand near me. But I haven’t experienced anything overt or aggressive, thankfully. I don’t think the discrimination I experienced, however, will affect my vote this fall.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: A </strong><a href="https://aapidata.com/blog/2022-aavs-motivated-electorate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>recent report</strong></a><strong> claimed that only about half of Asian Americans said they have been contacted by either major political party. Have you been contacted by either Democrats or Republicans this year? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: The Republican Party has reached out repeatedly in order to solicit donations, if that counts. But in terms of just contacting me to connect or get involved, I haven’t had either major political party reach out to me this cycle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vaidya: I have been contacted only by Democrats and only by one campaign, which would be the Beto O’Rourke campaign [for governor] in Texas. They’ve primarily reached out through mass texts soliciting donations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beeson: I have not been contacted ever in my life as far as I can recall, but I also don’t put myself out there very often. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What is a common stereotype or misconception about Asian American voters that you wish both parties would stop falling for?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fahim: I think a common misconception is that Asian Americans are a monolith. ... I wish there was a little bit more recognition of our differences versus just lumping us all under one ‘Asian American’ category. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bay: On the Republican side, it’d be the ‘model minority’ myth. Meanwhile, Democrats seem to take us for granted because they assume all people of color will vote left. Steven Yeun from The Walking Dead summed up my feeling perfectly when he said, “Sometimes I wonder if the Asian American experience is what it’s like when you’re thinking about everyone else, but no one is thinking about you.” That’s how I feel treated by both parties.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a time-honored tradition of election season: the debate. But for many midterm contests this year, it’s missing. Take the Senate race in Nevada. As of Tuesday, Oct. 18, three weeks before Election Day, Democratic incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and her Republican challenger, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/nevada-stands-alone-only-battleground-senate-debate-midterms-rcna52028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had not agreed to a debate before the Nov. 8 election</a>. It’s a closely watched, tight race — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast considers it a toss-up</a> — so the likelihood the candidates won’t meet on a debate stage seems a bit unusual. But it is not so unusual for this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Digging into a thorough (but not comprehensive) <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPyE8jDqKXVMnKjLQOYfJsQ7LPzu4lKu6ZsZeD2MK0A/edit#gid=1150776969" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database of debate schedules maintained</a> by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AP-aeseNIOU/gregory-giroux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregory Giroux of Bloomberg</a>, and supplementing it with our own research, we found that the 2022 cycle has seen fewer debates between candidates for Senate and governors than previous cycles.<a data-footnote-id="40" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-40" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did not count debates in House races because of the sheer number of them and our concerns about being comprehensive enough to include their data in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>40</sup></a> There are a number of possible reasons for this, but a big one might be that earlier this year the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/rnc-votes-withdrawal-commission-presidential-debates-84091035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican National Committee left the Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, claiming bias and ending a partnership with the Democratic Party that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/14/1092916451/republicans-say-theyre-quitting-the-biased-commission-on-presidential-debates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began in 1987</a>. While that doesn’t directly affect down-ticket races, it helped set a tone.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="This year has seen fewer debates between Senate candidates" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Nh3cd/11/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s look closely at the Senate. Out of 36 contests this year,<a data-footnote-id="41" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-41" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including special elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>41</sup></a> we counted only 19 debates in 15 contests held as of Oct. 18.<a data-footnote-id="42" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-42" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debates counted include at least two major candidates meeting to answer questions from an independent moderator. A &amp;#8220;major candidate&amp;#8221; is considered to be either a candidate from a major party, or a viable third-party or unaffiliated candidate, such as independent Evan McMullin in Utah in 2022. McMullin is being &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/16/utah-independent-senate-candidate-evan-mcmullin-00062004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;backed by state Democrats&lt;/a&gt; as that party decided not to nominate a candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>42</sup></a> Candidates in at least four states have had two debates: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, which are both competitive races; <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska</a>, in which Republican Kelly Tshibaka is slightly favored to beat incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, according to our Deluxe forecast; and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont</a>, which is considered safe for Democrat Peter Welch, currently the state’s at-large representative to the U.S. House. But in the other 11 states where the two major candidates have already debated — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Utah — the candidates have only met once. This means 58 percent of Senate races this year have not had any debates so far. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Some of this cycle’s debates looked like they wouldn’t happen at all until recently. That was the case for the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-tim-ryan-meet-ohio-senate-debate/story?id=91254198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oct. 10</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/wireStory/ryan-vance-odds-abortion-jan-ohio-senate-debate-91655554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oct. 17</a> debates in Ohio between Senate candidates Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat, and venture capitalist  J.D. Vance, a Republican. The candidates <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/09/tim-ryan-jd-vance-agree-to-two-october-debates-for-ohios-us-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negotiated the terms of the debates</a> through August and September, and one debate was canceled <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-ohio-campaigns-mike-dewine-political-debates-be1b69abcd9ad518744ba667bd145332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after Vance did not respond to an invitation</a> by the Ohio Debate Commission. In the end, Vance and Ryan’s latest debates may have <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/tim-ryan-and-jd-vance-trade-insults-in-bitter-ohio-senate-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted the differences</a> between the two candidates but don’t seem to have upended the race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To compare those numbers to previous election cycles, we set a cutoff date of three weeks before Election Day. In 2020, a year marked by special protocols because of the COVID-19 pandemic, candidates in 20 Senate races had held debates by this point in the election cycle, 57 percent of the total. (That year in the Senate, there were 33 regularly scheduled elections and two special elections.) Candidates in nine of those races had held more than one debate. In Maine, where Democrat Sara Gideon hoped to unseat longtime Republican incumbent Sen. Susan Collins, the candidates had debated twice by this point in the cycle, and would go on to meet <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/29/final-debate-susan-collins-and-sara-gideon-spar-over-senate-seat/6067727002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three more times</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Previous recent election cycles were more similar to 2020 than to this year, and my colleague Nathaniel Rakich kept track of the numbers of debates — again, supplemented by additional research — in 2016 and 2018. In 2016, 65 percent of that cycle’s 34 Senate races had featured at least one debate by this point in the cycle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">2016 and 2020 are presidential election years, though, when more people are tuned into politics and there’s a top-of-the-ticket election to raise the stakes. Yet even when compared with the previous midterm cycle, this year’s debate numbers are lagging. In 2018, 49 percent of Senate races had at least one debate by now. That year, there were also six races in which candidates had already met for two or more debates, leading to a higher overall total of debates held by this point: 24 in 2018 compared with 19 this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, there were more Senate debates in the final three weeks before the 2018 election than there are currently scheduled for this year.<a data-footnote-id="43" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-43" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 2 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>43</sup></a> In 2018, there were at least 27 gubernatorial and 17 Senate debates across the country in the final three weeks until Election Day, including multiple debates in some races. This year, at least 13 gubernatorial and eight Senate debates are scheduled for these final three weeks. Time is running out for this year’s candidates to catch up.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Candidate debates are now less common in statewide races" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nSykQ/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">For governor’s races, there is a similar but slightly less dramatic decline. In 2018, the same number of seats up for grabs as this year — 36 — and there had been debates in 72 percent of the races as of three weeks before the election. In 13 states, candidates had already met more than once. This year, candidates in only 58 percent of gubernatorial elections have debated in the same timeframe, and only eight states have held multiple debates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year also saw an acceleration of a similar trend that dates <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2018/09/three_of_alabamas_last_four_go.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back to at least 2016</a>: high-profile, major-party frontrunners, usually Republicans, skipping debates altogether. In some cases, this has left <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9okuNawcpOs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XEtmSvz3Aw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate</a> to answer questions alone, or led to a <a href="https://mydakotan.com/2022/09/hoeven-declines-nd-senate-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debate between</a> <a href="https://710keel.com/louisiana-senate-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a major-party challenger</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhQIyg7UPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-party or unaffiliated candidate</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few caveats here: We tried to be thorough, but we could have missed some debates. And there are still three weeks for candidates to add debates to this year’s schedule. Of course, there is also time for currently scheduled debates to be canceled. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite that, it does seem that debates got off to a slower start this year, and there are comparatively fewer contests in which candidates will debate at all, and fewer races where candidates will meet more than once. What’s going on? Most of the COVID-19 restrictions, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/us/politics/trump-debate-coronavirus-safety.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate testing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8DHcnwAvKw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social distancing</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/politics/dnc-coronavirus-primary-debate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debates without live audiences</a>, have been lifted, but it’s possible that’s had a lasting effect on some debate traditions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also valid reasons candidates might decline to debate. There’s <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/presidential-debates-have-shockingly-little-effect-on-election-outcomes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ample evidence</a> that general-election presidential debates, for example, don’t make much of a difference. By the time debates are held, many voters have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/28/5-facts-about-presidential-and-vice-presidential-debates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made up their minds</a> about who to vote for, and most of those who haven’t aren’t very swayed by the debates. The events <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/08/senate-debate-season-2022-00055352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can hurt candidates</a>, though, making them high risk and low reward. It would be hard to argue that any one debate misstep cost a candidate an election, but these moments can live on in viral social media and cause a blow to a campaign. That was the case when, in a Republican presidential primary debate, then-Gov. Rick Perry of Texas <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/21/1124218284/this-midterm-season-the-role-of-the-debate-has-changed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forgot the name of one of the three cabinet departments</a> he said he’d eliminate. They can also feed into overall perceptions of candidates, as when former President George H.W. Bush <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBrW2Pz9Iiw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checked his watch during a town hall debate</a> in 1992 and then flubbed answering a voter’s question about the economy, making him seem aloof and disconnected.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the same forces apply in Senate, House and gubernatorial contests, and there are additional factors this cycle too. Nationally, the Democratic Party <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/10/democrats-midterms-spending-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is spending less on candidates across the country</a> than they did in recent cycles, when they spent millions even on longshot races, which may mean fewer well-funded campaigns with the resources to push for debates. In some states, Democrats running for statewide office <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/leading-democrats-debate-election-denying-opponents/story?id=90660587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are refusing to debate their election-denying opponents</a>. But the <a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/mastriano-and-shapiro-cant-agree-to-terms-for-gubernatorial-debate/41465165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bigger trend seems to be that Republican candidates</a> around the country are declining debate opportunities, driven by <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/09/01/candidates-mostly-republican-skip-debates-bar-press-during-midterm-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skepticism of and hostility toward the media outlets</a> that often host, moderate and air the debates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But voters do tend to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/28/5-facts-about-presidential-and-vice-presidential-debates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch <em>presidential</em> debates when they happen</a>, and say they find them useful, according to the Pew Research Center. In midterm years like this one, when people are less tuned into politics than during presidential election years, the debates themselves <a href="https://www.wrdw.com/2022/10/07/political-science-expert-weighs-importance-debates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might remind voters</a> there’s an election in their state at all and inspire them to make it to the polls. And there are arguments that regular debates in which candidates spontaneously answer questions on important issues in front of voters are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/10/10/the-worrying-decline-of-the-senate-candidate-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good for democracy as a whole</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the trendline is clear. The number of debates have declined so far this year. The question is whether one day they disappear for good.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“We’ve had the death threats,” Stacie Wilke-McCulloch said. “We’ve had the, ‘We know where you live,’ and all that.” As a trustee on the school board for Carson City, Nevada, for the past 14 years, Wilke-McCulloch is no stranger to harassment, particularly as <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2021/12/16/are-fiery-school-board-meetings-representative-of-all-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school boards bore the brunt of criticism</a> over <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-education-threats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial curricula and school closures related to COVID-19</a>. As a result, she’s gained a thick skin that may serve her well in what she hopes will be her next job: Carson City County Clerk-Recorder. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Once occupying a low-profile, largely bureaucratic position, county clerks are increasingly the target of intense public vitriol. Typically the chief election official for their communities, county clerks and other local election workers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/campaign-of-fear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have faced harassment from voters</a> convinced the 2020 election was fraudulent, thanks to former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of a stolen election. As a result, some election officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/us/politics/2020-election-voting-officials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are leaving their posts</a> — and in some places, election deniers are <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/behind-the-campaign-to-put-election-deniers-in-charge-of-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing up to replace them</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s only one part of the story. Across the country, many local election officials are staying put with the support of their communities. And in Nevada, where county clerks are up for election this fall, the full spectrum of local election administration is on display: the good, the bad and the conspiracy-riddled. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Carson City, Clerk-Recorder Aubrey Rowlatt is not running for reelection after serving just one term, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family. But <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/election-official-departures-rising-amid-burnout-angry-voters-new-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she also told the Nevada Independent</a> that she was burned out and wasn’t looking forward to administering this year’s election after how “emotionally charged” the 2020 election was. That said, Rowlatt won’t be replaced by an election denier. In interviews with FiveThirtyEight, both Wilke-McCulloch and opponent Scott Hoen said they believed the 2020 election was legitimate. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Out of Nevada’s 17 counties and county equivalents, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 have elected county clerks</a> who serve as the chief election official (two counties, Clark and Washoe, have an appointed registrar of voters who oversees elections). Of those 15, 12 have an incumbent clerk who is running unopposed in the general election next month, many of whom have been in the job for years. While some had to fend off challengers in the primary, others, like White Pine Clerk Nichole Baldwin, ran unopposed there, too. Baldwin — who was first elected in 2014 — said that although the 2020 election led to an unprecedented level of public response and distrust, she hasn’t experienced harassment or threats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every time the public has approached us with questions or assertions of failed election integrity, I’ve been able to effectively respond to them directly, and whether or not they accept my answer, they walk away,” Baldwin said. “There are a lot of us [clerks] who are sticking it out.”</p>

Trump’s claims of a stolen 2020 election sowed distrust in Nye County, where the voting machines used to not only cast but also count ballots came under intense scrutiny. In March, the county commissioners <a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2022/10/11/nye-county-nevada-ballots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to recommend the county switch to hand-counting paper ballots</a>, despite County Clerk Sandra Merlino’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-las-vegas-nevada-race-and-ethnicity-elections-81814d555debbe44c3be812b43742abd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defense of the system’s security</a>. As a result, Merlino threw in the towel after more than 20 years in the job, <a href="https://pvtimes.com/news/nye-county-bids-farewell-to-longtime-clerk-merlino-111902/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retiring this summer</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/us/politics/nye-county-nevada-hand-count-mail-ballots.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACLU is suing</a> the county, and an election denier was appointed to replace Merlino. Mark Kampf, who won the Republican nomination for county clerk in June, was appointed to fill Merlino’s post through the election, in which he is running against one other candidate. <a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/2020-election-denier-tapped-to-oversee-voting-in-nye-county-mark-kampf-clerk-pahrump-tonopah-secretary-of-state-barbara-cegavske-hand-count-donald-trump-gop-republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kampf has repeated election fraud conspiracy theories</a> and said he believes Trump won in 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And he’s not alone. The Storey County Clerk-Treasurer was, until February of this year, Vanessa Stephens, who resigned; it’s currently Jim Hindle, <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/politics/nevada-republican-who-signed-fake-certificate-for-trump-wins-race-for-top-elections-official/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who signed on to serve as one</a> of the illegitimate “alternate electors” for Trump in an attempt to overturn the state’s presidential election results. Hindle <a href="https://silverstateelection.nv.gov/county-results/storey.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a closely contested GOP primary</a> in the summer, and is also running unopposed in November. And Jim Marchant, the Republican nominee to be the top election official in the state, said not only that the 2020 election was fraudulent, but also <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-debates-secretary-of-state-candidates-cast-wildly-different-visions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that the vote of Nevadans</a> “hasn’t counted for decades,” falsely claiming election winners had been “selected” rather than elected. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even in counties where the incumbent clerk has remained in place, election conspiracy theories are fueling changes. County commissioners floated the <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/esmeralda-is-latest-rural-county-to-try-ditching-electronic-voting-machines-move-to-hand-counting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">idea of abandoning voting machines</a> in Elko and Lincoln counties, and in Esmeralda County — as in Nye County — it was adopted. Though voting using hand-marked paper ballots is <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/08/14/why-paper-is-considered-state-of-the-art-voting-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered the gold standard</a> for election security, hand-counting those ballots — as opposed to using vote-tabulation machines — is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/07/1126796538/voting-explainer-hand-counting-ballots-accuracy-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time-intensive, costly and prone to error</a>. As long as there are paper records and precautions taken to limit risk, vote-tabulation machines are considered both secure and efficient. Meanwhile, Lander County <a href="https://elkodaily.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/lander-county-to-replace-dominion-voting-machines/article_7f11691f-8857-56d7-a3be-baffb0c9fb46.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commissioners voted to spend nearly a quarter of a million dollars</a> to replace the Dominion voting machines used with ones made by another company, ES&amp;S, due to false conspiracy theories around Dominion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So while the threat of election deniers taking over election administration hasn’t infiltrated every corner of Nevada, a meaningful shift is happening, according to <a href="https://dfdamore.faculty.unlv.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Damore</a>, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Election administration is now a partisan issue whereas in the past it was just government doing government business,” Damore said. In this way, Nevada is a microcosm of what we’re seeing in elections across the U.S. It’s not as though veteran, trusted election administrators are being replaced wholesale with election-denying conspiracy theorists, but that threat is real. We’re now in an era where political parties are not only concerned with who wins elections, but also who runs them. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>Back by popular demand (a phrase which here means “Alex peer-pressured me into it”), it’s the FiveThirtyEight politics chat! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are somehow only three weeks left until Election Day, and the FiveThirtyEight forecast is furiously updating several times a day now. As of Tuesday, Oct. 18, at 1 p.m. Eastern, Democrats had a 63-in-100 chance of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holding onto the Senate</a> in the Deluxe version of our forecast, and Republicans had a 73-in-100 chance of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipping the House</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we know better than some <em>computer</em>, right?! (<em>Editor’s note: No, the whole point of the forecast is to eliminate the biases that inevitably arise when humans make predictions.</em>) OK, fine, good point, editor. But there <em>are</em> things that the model doesn’t know that we do — like which races the national parties have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/22/house-gop-cuts-loose-candidate-who-misled-about-military-service-00058406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given up on</a> and which candidates are <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/09/doug-mastriano-doesnt-call-himself-a-christian-nationalist-but-hes-certainly-given-the-doctrine-a-platform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too extreme</a> or otherwise <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embroiled in controversy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So today, we’re going to play a game of “Are You Smarter Than The FiveThirtyEight Forecast?” I’m going to name a few important races and cite the FiveThirtyEight forecast’s odds in them. Then you guys tell me whether you think the forecast is too good for Democrats or too good for Republicans. (If you want to be a coward, you can also say you think the forecast is about right.) Everyone ready?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/win-house-watch-districts-fivethirtyeight-91751494</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst):<strong> </strong>I am ready to outthink you, IBM Blue/Watson/whatever your name is. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/santul-nerkar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santul Nerkar</a>, editor):<strong> </strong>I am ready to lose!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): This chat will prove why I’m not an election forecaster. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, let’s start with the <strong>Arizona governor’s race</strong>. According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Deluxe forecast</a>, Republican former newscaster Kari Lake has a 55-in-100 chance of winning and Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs has a 45-in-100 chance. What say you?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>This might be an unpopular opinion, but I’m honestly surprised this race isn’t more squarely in Lake’s column. Our forecast and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> have Lake and Hobbs essentially tied, but it just seems like Lake is the more visible candidate — especially lately. There are <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/15/kari-lake-arizona-trump-midterm-elections-maga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so many</a> stories <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/politics/kari-lake-arizona-governor-swing-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out there</a> now about how she’s a rising star in the GOP and could even be a Republican presidential candidate in the future. I’m not sure if “charisma” is the right term to use here, but her <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/arizona-kari-lake-false-fraud-claims-2020-election-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience as a TV personality</a>, plus the fact that she’s been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/16/kari-lake-arizona-election-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the news a lot</a> recently (kinda like former President Donald Trump!), could make her a tough candidate to beat. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>At the risk of sounding like a coward right off the bat, I think the forecast here sounds about right! As our colleague Kaleigh Rogers <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/arizona-election-update-blake-masters-kari-lake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last month</a>, Lake has much better odds in the governor’s race than Republican venture capitalist Blake Masters does in the Senate race. Part of that comes down to the opponents each candidate is facing, but it may also suggest that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openly denying the legitimacy of the 2020 election</a> might not be a death knell for one’s candidacy. (Lake has been one of the leading proponents of the baseless idea that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, while Masters has been more circumspect.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plus, there are other reasons to be more bullish on Lake than on Masters. She enjoys high name recognition due to two decades as a local TV newscaster, as Alex mentioned, while Hobbs has <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/21/democratic-candidate-katie-hobbs-criticizes-2020-election-fraud-claims/10118553002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced widespread scrutiny</a> on the right, thanks to her up-close-and-personal role administering the 2020 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>To be clear, I don’t think the forecast is wildly underestimating Lake’s odds in this race, because it’ll probably be a close one. At least <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-2022-elections-in-arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one recent poll</a> has Hobbs’s and Lake’s favorability numbers tied at 39 percent (Lake’s favorability was net -3 points, while Hobbs’s was net +3 points), and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-kelly-opinion-poll-arizona-senate-economy-abortion-immigration-2022-10-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another poll</a> showed that just over half the state’s registered voters (51 percent) classified Lake’s views as “extreme.” I think what differentiates Lake is her visibility/personality — and that could resonate with voters! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I also tend to view our forecast as about right on this one. The polls have been close, and <a href="https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/katie-hobbs-has-fundraising-edge-in-race-for-arizona-governor/article_322f1026-4e4e-11ed-9ec7-539915fed12e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hobbs has outraised Lake</a>, but Lake has had more outside financial help (mostly from the Republican Governors Association). Lake is a combative, controversial candidate, but Hobbs isn’t a force in the same way Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is in the Senate contest. For one thing, she’s had to answer for a scandal regarding the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/12/08/katie-hobbs-apologizes-recognizes-discrimination-talonya-adams-firing/6426337001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firing of a Black staff member</a> who served under her when she was in the state Legislature.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Hmmmm. You guys have all made compelling points! I’m going to say the forecast is too good for Republicans, though. I don’t think we need to overthink this one: Lake is a far-right candidate without prior political experience, and Hobbs is a statewide elected official. Plus, Kelly is a pretty good bet to win the Senate race, and as Geoffrey <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fewer-americans-are-likely-to-vote-for-a-republican-governor-and-a-democratic-senator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last week</a>, Senate and governor’s races just don’t go in opposite directions very often anymore. But I agree that the race is close — I think I would just personally switch the odds (so Hobbs at 55-in-100, Lake at 45-in-100).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, let’s move on to the <strong>Pennsylvania governor’s race</strong>. This one is pretty different: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Deluxe forecast</a> gives Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro a 96-in-100 chance of winning. Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano has just a 4-in-100 chance. Thoughts?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>In a state that has a <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/partisan-lean/fivethirtyeight_partisan_lean_STATES.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan lean</a> just slightly to the right of the country, I have a hard time viewing a Democratic candidate as a safe bet — which is what being clear of 95 percent suggests. So I would say this feels too confident in Democrats’ chances. Shapiro is clearly a strong favorite, but nearly a sure thing in a midterm year with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Democrat in the White House</a> in a purple state? No. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Pennsylvania is an interesting state because, yes, I think it’s possible that the polling here might overestimate Democrats in both the Senate and governor’s races. But I agree with our forecast — and the takeaways of other prognosticators — that Shapiro has a clear edge here. It’s pretty telling that national Republicans have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/11/republicans-governor-elections-2022-tv-ads-00061005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">practically abandoned</a> Mastriano.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>OK, but to play devil’s advocate: Shapiro leads in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> by 11 percentage points. That’s a <em>huge</em> lead, and it would require an historic polling error to overcome. Maybe the race will tighten, but you guys don’t think this is safely Democratic?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>To be clear, I’m inclined to agree with our forecast because the GOP kind of, uh, fumbled in Pennsylvania. Neither Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz nor Mastriano are particularly well-liked, and that could dampen turnout among the GOP base. According to a <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/PA-topline_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-September-22-26_released-Sep-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September Fox News/Beacon Research/Shaw &amp;</a> <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/PA-topline_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-September-22-26_released-Sep-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Company Research poll</a>, 34 percent of Oz supporters and 27 percent of Mastriano supporters said they had “some reservations” about their candidate. (Twenty percent of Democratic Lt. Gov John Fetterman’s supporters and 19 percent of Shapiro supporters said the same.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Nathaniel, I guess I’m just focused on the “fundamentals” — the non-polling factors that affect an election, like partisanship and candidate quality. When the fundamentals and polls are this far apart, I get a little uneasy (more on this later). Now, it is true that they can diverge more in governors’ races than in races for federal office, as voters are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as reflexively partisan</a> about gubernatorial races. That certainly is part of why the Pennsylvania gubernatorial contest is where it is. But the forecast still appears too strong for Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Yeah, I’m still going to have to say our forecast is too confident in Democrats’ chances. Along with what Geoffrey said about Pennsylvania’s rightward tilt relative to the country, I refer back to Inside Elections’s rating of the race as “<a href="http://www.insideelections.com/ratings/governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lean Democratic</a>” — which is closer to what our forecast says about the Senate race in the state. And if you view 96 percent as translating to “safe” for Democrats, I find it hard to believe there would be such a large divergence between what the experts and fundamentals are saying and what the polling is saying. I’ll take the side of the former.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah. And actually, I secretly agree with you guys: I think our forecast is too good for Democrats here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, let’s stay in the Keystone State but switch campaigns. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Deluxe forecast</a> for the <strong>Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race</strong> gives Fetterman a 70-in-100 chance, while Oz has a 30-in-100 chance. What do you guys think?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>It’s interesting that the race here <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fetterman-oz-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is tightening</a>. I think that’s a sign that we may be overstating Fetterman’s strength here, too. If I were to bet today, I’d say that Fetterman still has a nice edge since he’s never trailed Oz in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public polling</a>. But the GOP’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-health-new-york-stroke-pennsylvania-1ac53728bd7de09c86ab2da88b94b3be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacks on Fetterman and his health</a> may have weakened him as a candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I think the forecast is about right here. As Alex said earlier, Pennsylvania Republicans just nominated an especially weak slate of statewide candidates this year. Mastriano is a far-right election denier, and Oz is super unpopular thanks to his reputation for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/magazine/dr-oz-pennsylvania-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carpetbagging from New Jersey</a> and a nasty Republican primary that <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-polling-favorability-fetterman-pa-2022-20220630.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dragged down his unfavorable ratings</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>We have almost no fresh polling in this race. There have been <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TRF-PA-General-1013-Full-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just two polls</a> conducted entirely in October, and while both showed Fetterman just barely ahead of Oz, the lack of data here makes me nervous, especially because we saw things tightening based on polls in late September. So I’m inclined to say our forecast is overstating the Democrats’ edge here too. Still, Oz’s favorability numbers are strikingly bad: In late September, <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/10_4_2022_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=4BD88F8A9A453DD5901885959737AFB0274433BF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk University/USA Today</a> found that just 34 percent of likely voters had a favorable view of Oz, versus 51 percent who said they had an unfavorable view. By comparison, Fetterman was in the mid-40s for both favorability and unfavorability. That may have changed — give us new polls! — but for now I’d still call Fetterman the favorite.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Oh, good catch about the lack of recent polling, Geoffrey.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I think 70-in-100 sounds about right for Fetterman’s odds. Back in September, when our polling average found Fetterman leading by nearly 11 (!) points, Democrats’ overall chances in the Senate had reached a peak of about 70-in-100. But as the national environment has tightened, so has this race. I think the national forces that have slightly tempered Democrats’ chances in the Senate — decreasing enthusiasm around <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-republicans-climate-change-immigration-ipsos-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issues like abortion</a>, and increasing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/us/politics/republicans-economy-nyt-siena-poll.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus on the economy</a> — have also largely applied to the Pennsylvania Senate race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I love how “our forecast is largely right” has been the takeaway of this chat so far! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>In Math We Trust.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, moving on to … <strong>Nevada</strong>! <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Deluxe forecast</a> says Republican former Attorney General Adam Laxalt has a 51-in-100 chance of winning the U.S. Senate race, while Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto is at 49-in-100. Where would you guys place your bets?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>This race is going to give Democrats heartburn on Election Day, I suspect. A few months ago, I would’ve said that Cortez Masto was in a slightly better position than, say, Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia. But this is why I’m not an election forecaster! Laxalt doesn’t have the same baggage as some of his fellow GOP candidates, like Oz and Herschel Walker of Georgia. So I think this race might come down to whether Democrats are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-driving-bidens-approval-rating-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still on the upswing</a> come Election Day or if a Republican-friendly environment <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bounces back</a>. The fact that Laxalt “leads” Cortez Masto by less than a point in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average</a> means that this race is truly a toss-up, but given the conventional wisdom around midterm elections favoring the party not in the White House, I give Laxalt a slight edge.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I’m inclined to think that our forecast is slightly underrating Republicans’ chances in Nevada. As FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nevada-could-be-senate-republicans-ace-in-the-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently wrote</a>, Nevada isn’t <em>that</em> blue, and midterm elections have often dealt Democrats big losses in the Silver State. Moreover, Nevada doesn’t fit the demographic profile of states in which Democrats have gained in recent years: It has relatively few Black voters, and it’s among the states with the lowest share of college-educated voters — a group with whom Democrats have struggled in recent cycles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>This one feels right to me. Cortez Masto could be the most endangered Democratic incumbent on the ballot: As a former elected official with campaign experience, Laxalt is a better candidate for Republicans than what they have in states like Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. But <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00575548/1642917/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cortez Masto</a> also outraised <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00787135/1642073/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laxalt</a> almost three-to-one in the third quarter of 2022, and while the GOP <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NVS2&amp;spec=N%20https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2010&amp;fips=32&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has more outside spending</a>, candidate committees <a href="https://www.broadcastlawblog.com/2020/10/articles/a-video-summary-of-the-rules-on-lowest-unit-rates-and-other-political-broadcasting-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get much cheaper rates</a> for running ads on TV and radio, so Cortez Masto and Democrats collectively are likely getting more bang for their buck.  Moreover, Nevada midterm polling has a history of underestimating Democrats — former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Cortez Masto’s predecessor, famously <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/senate/nv/nevada_senate_angle_vs_reid-1517.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailed by 2 to 3 points</a> heading into Election Day 2010, only to then win by nearly 6 points. That doesn’t mean it will happen again, but these factors make me inclined to not write off Cortez Masto.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, I was intentionally waiting to weigh in on this one…</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I think you’re right, Geoffrey. The vibe ~online~ seems to be that Laxalt is now the favorite, and I’m just not sure that’s true. The race is definitely super close, though, so I’m going to trust the forecast on this one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>This race also might come down to which issues voters prioritize more (surprise, surprise!). Of course, following the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion access should theoretically be a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nevada-senate-race-emerges-as-test-of-abortion-issue-after-roe-v-wade-overturned-11661004000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivating issue for Democrats</a> in the state. But since abortion access is <a href="https://www.kunr.org/politics-and-policy/2022-05-03/nevada-ag-abortions-largely-protected-under-state-constitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enshrined in Nevada’s state constitution</a>, I wonder whether voters will prioritize other issues, such as the economy? In a state like Nevada, that’d certainly make sense — especially considering the impact that the <a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/new-report-reveals-how-hard-pandemic-hit-las-vegas-tourism-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 pandemic had</a> on the state’s tourism industry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>How about another Senate race that’s been in the news a lot lately: <strong>Georgia</strong>? <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Deluxe forecast</a> currently gives Warnock a 59-in-100 chance of winning, while Walker has a 41-in-100 chance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Unlike Pennsylvania, Georgia has been polled a lot recently, and Warnock has consistently led in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every recent poll</a> not sponsored by Walker’s campaign. Warnock’s leads have been slight, though, so the forecast feels about right — generally speaking, a toss-up, but Warnock with the slimmest of edges. In fact, Warnock has made some narrow gains, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you recently wrote</a>, Nathaniel, in the aftermath of allegations that Walker, who opposes abortion rights, paid for a former girlfriend’s abortion in 2009. (Walker denies the claims.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our forecast shows about a 1-in-5 chance of a runoff, too, which also feels right to me. I’m not making any plans for the first week of December. … </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I’m not convinced! Consider that, a few weeks ago, this was arguably the most contested Senate race in the country, and <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/senate/race/230821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some forecasters</a> predicted that a runoff was possible. I think Walker’s abortion controversy impacted voters’ perception of him (as evidenced by the polls) and that Warnock does have an edge here — but I’m also not yet convinced that he’ll win the race outright in November. Even though Warnock’s polling lead has widened, he still sits at just 48 percent in our average. Now, if he were at 52 or 54 percent, I might feel differently! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Yeah, with the 2021 Georgia runoffs a <em>big</em> exception, Georgia runoffs have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically benefited Republican candidates</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Really, Nathaniel? If the race goes to a runoff, I’d think Warnock would be favored because Walker wouldn’t be able to ride Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s coattails to victory. (Kemp is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily favored</a> in his race and has cleared 50 percent in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some recent polls</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I mean, it’s very possible. Especially if control of the Senate is on the line again. I think that motivated Democrats to turn out and buck the trend in 2021.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, if we’re unlucky — election watchers like a break, too — we’ll get to find out whether 2021 is the new normal or an outlier. I can make the case that Warnock will benefit (what Alex said) or that Walker will (the pre-2021 runoff history). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Siding with Alex over this supposed “history” sounds like a safer bet, Geoff! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92a.png" alt="🤪"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>I’m all about that history, though, Alex. But I remain open to new trends!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Something I’ve been tracking is whether Walker’s election odds ever dip below his alma mater’s chances of winning the College Football Playoff, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-college-football-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s forecast</a>. (As of now, that seems unlikely — Walker’s Senate chances are 41-in-100, while the Bulldogs have a 23 percent chance of defending their title.)<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, Oct. 18, at 1 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a more serious note, I think our forecast is properly appraising Walker’s chances. Yes, his polling has been shaky, especially after the abortion story. But Georgia still leans to the right of the nation as a whole, and the fundamentals suggest a closer race than the polling — which, again, has been consistently in Warnock’s favor. And to Nathaniel’s point, if this race goes to a runoff, history would seem to be on the side of Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adding all of that together, I think an outlook that gives Warnock decent-but-not-overwhelming odds seems like a fair landing spot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I think you guys are probably making the more sensible calls, but I’m going to be a little <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> spicy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> here and say that the forecast is too good for <em>Republicans</em>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">My hack for this game has been to look at the Classic version of the forecast, instead of the default Deluxe version. The Classic version <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blends the polls and fundamentals</a>, while Deluxe adds in expert ratings like those from Inside Elections and Sabato’s Crystal Ball. And while Warnock is at 59-in-100 in the Deluxe version, he is at 68-in-100 in the Classic version.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means the outside experts are more bullish on Walker than our forecast is by itself. And that … doesn’t really make sense to me. Walker is an incredibly flawed candidate — another political novice like Lake, and someone with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple scandals</a> and controversies surrounding him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given the rate at which bad headlines have <a href="https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/state/georgia/article258250315.html#storylink=cpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drip</a>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-says-hes-a-model-dad-he-has-a-secret-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drip</a>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-critic-of-absentee-dads-admits-to-yet-another-secret-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dripped</a> out about him, I wouldn’t be surprised if even more scandals emerge in these last three weeks of campaigning. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I assume the expert raters are being cautious with Georgia because of its history as a red state, but partisanship is accounted for in the forecast. Walker’s weakness as a candidate, IMO, is not (at least not fully).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Spicy take, Nathaniel! I guess I still feel like it’s entirely possible that Kemp drags Walker across the finish line on Election Day. That’s another reason why it’s hard for me to say with certainty that Walker’s finished here!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, Alex, the gap between the margins in Georgia’s Senate and gubernatorial races <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been pretty small</a> in the past. But it looks like we’re going to get a larger one this time around, with Kemp leading by almost 6 points and Warnock by almost 4 points, per our polling averages. But how large will matter a great deal, because the more split-ticket voters there are, the better it is for Warnock, given Kemp’s stronger position.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>I guess my question is how much of a candidate-specific “tax” or penalty Georgia voters will apply to Walker. To Alex’s point, Kemp seems to be on fairly solid footing in his race against former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, while Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger also <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/ajc-poll-raffensperger-leads-ga-elections-race-after-resisting-trump/7YZMC3RNYRCWBKUBK2PZPU3LWY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks safe</a> against his Democratic challenger. In other words, can a GOP Senate candidate run several points behind other statewide candidates and lose in a “red wave” year in Georgia? I’m not sold on that yet.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>If a red wave were developing, Santul, I’d agree with you! But so far, it looks like this will be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closer to a neutral year</a> than a 2010-style red wave.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Anyway, we can save that debate for our last question. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For now, one last Senate race. It’s not one of the top-tier ones, but I think it’s an interesting one for the purposes of this exercise: <strong>Ohio</strong>. The default, Deluxe version of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast</a> gives Republican author J.D. Vance a 73-in-100 chance of winning and Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan a 27-in-100 chance. However, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling is much tighter</a>, and the Lite version of our forecast (which uses only polls) gives Vance only a 56-in-100 chance. Where would you guys peg the race?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Vance seems like a pretty mediocre candidate, as <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/OH/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s been massively outraised</a> and <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/news-features/news/2022/10/18/17/48/poll-shows-ohio-republican-vance-gaining-narrow-edge-over-democrat-ryan-in-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has struggled to consolidate support</a> among the GOP base. However, I’ll be pretty stunned if he doesn’t win on Nov. 8, so count me as one who views our forecast as underselling the GOP’s odds. With an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular Democrat</a> in the White House, I have a hard time seeing a Democrat winning a Senate race in a state that <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=39&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump won</a> by 8 points. If it were 2018 (a good year for Democrats) and we had this matchup, then I’d be singing a different, toss-up tune. But it’s 2022, so I anticipate Vance will be in the Senate come January.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I agree with the sentiment that Vance has an edge here. While I <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/trump-endorses-never-trump-guy-jd-vance-ignoring-many-ohio-republicans-who-wanted-him-to-pick-a-different-candidate-in-a-key-senate-race/articleshow/90869767.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also don’t think</a> that he’s a particularly strong candidate, it’ll be hard for Ryan to cut through in a light-red state. The fact that national Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/10/j-d-vance-tim-ryan-ohio-senate-debate-00061144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have spent a ton of money</a> on Vance’s behalf in the lead-up to Election Day signals to me that this will likely be a close contest, as the Lite version of our forecast suggests. But I think the fact that we’re even talking about a competitive Senate race in such a pro-Trump state speaks volumes about either Ryan’s strength as a candidate and/or Vance’s weakness as one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Yeah, I don’t see a big reason to fault our forecast here, either. To keep things simple, it’s hard to imagine that just two years after Democrats strongly underperformed expectations in the presidential election — and where Biden’s approval is <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/politics/2022/09/27/exclusive-spectrum-news-siena-college-poll-takes-pulse-of-ohio-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep underwater</a> — a Democrat will win a Senate seat. There are reasons to be skeptical of Vance, as he has attracted a lot of scrutiny for his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/06/politics/jd-vance-tweets-trump-apology/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about-face on Trump</a> — going from the “Never Trump” camp of the GOP to a staunchly pro-Trump one. That being said, Vance hasn’t embroiled himself in scandal and controversy quite like, say, Walker, and it’s less clear whether Ohio voters will dock Vance for his transgressions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>I’m with Geoffrey here — I think our Ohio forecast, even the Deluxe version, is still too good for Democrats. One tidbit that I think is overlooked: Ryan doesn’t actually have a history of overperforming with white, working-class voters the way his reputation suggests. In 2020, he did just 1.5 points better than Biden in his Youngstown-area congressional district. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, time for our last question! There are too many <strong>House</strong> races to talk about them individually, so we’ll just look at the lower chamber as a whole. As a refresher, our forecast gives Republicans a 73-in-100 chance of flipping the House, while Democrats have just a 27-in-100 chance of keeping control. What are your thoughts?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>If you go district by district, I think it’s hard <em>not</em> to come up with an outcome in which the GOP nets at least five House seats — the mark they need to claim the House, which Democrats currently hold 222 to 213 — so I guess I’m a bit more bullish on their chances than the forecast is. For instance, the GOP <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/gop-house-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should pick up</a> five or six seats based on partisanship alone (with an assist from redistricting, which made several seats notably redder in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>). And history suggests that Republicans <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/historically-toss-races-break-decidedly-toward-one-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will eat into the toss-up seats</a> held by Democrats, too. So I think the narrow margins here make a Republican majority somewhat more likely than roughly 3-in-4.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>I mean, I don’t think anyone’s writing off the very real possibility of a red wave. I’m inclined (once again!) to agree with our forecast’s odds of Republicans’ chances here. I know I jokingly bashed “history” before, but I just can’t see Democrats overcoming the conventional wisdom regarding midterm elections. …</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>Agreed. The average midterm election since the end of World War II has seen the president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose 26 House seats</a>. And Democrats did a good job bucking that trend for much of the summer (thanks to the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision), but polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> are starting to move back toward Republicans. And while there’s no guarantee that that trend will continue, it does fit with the historical pattern of polls getting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-midterm-chances-dont-hinge-on-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily worse for the president’s party</a> as the midterms approach.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It should be noted that that is already baked into the forecast, which already expects the national environment to improve for Republicans. But the forecast, too, has ticked toward the GOP in the last couple weeks.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="808" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-house-change-711-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-house-change-711-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-house-change-711-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-house-change-711-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley: </strong>Yeah, the way I see it, I would give Republicans a better than 3-in-4 chance of getting the minimum they need to control the chamber. But in terms of the magnitude of their gains, I’m far less certain. According to the forecast, 80 percent of outcomes fall between the Republicans winning 210 seats (meaning there’d be a Democratic-controlled House) to 244 seats (a very strong Republican showing). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>santul.nerkar: </strong>Yeah, I think the conventional wisdom would suggest that the House is still Republicans’ to lose in November — even with the bounce Democrats enjoyed over the summer after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The last midterm in which a party that had the presidency went on to gain seats in the House was 2002, the first election after the Sept. 11 attacks and amid strong approval ratings for former President George W. Bush. Though there have already been watershed moments for the Biden administration that could serve to boost overall turnout — including the forgiveness of some student loans, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the call to reschedule marijuana — Biden’s approval remains around 10 points underwater. That’s not a recipe for keeping the House, and our model reflects that reality.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Two weeks ago, the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-life-herschel-walker-paid-for-girlfriends-abortion-georgia-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world learned</a> that Herschel Walker, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Georgia who supports a total abortion ban without exceptions, had paid for his pregnant then-girlfriend to get an abortion in 2009. (Walker denies this.) At the time, we cautioned that we would need to wait and see how the controversy might <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affect Walker’s chances of winning the race</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We now have new polling data that suggests that the story may have cost Walker <em>some</em> support.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> Those surveys showed Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock leading, on average, 48 percent to 45 percent among likely voters. Previously, in those same pollsters’ most recent surveys taken before the news broke, the two candidates were essentially tied at 47 percent each.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That’s not a ton of movement; it’s also narrow enough to be within the surveys’ margins of error. But the consistency among pollsters gives us more confidence that it represents a true shift.

After all, there’s no way to prove that the revelation <em>caused</em> this shift in the polls. And in fact, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/uga-poll-warnock-walker-close-kemp-builds-lead-over-abrams/DAY5A2E4WFCFJJELA3WHAL6ILE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two</a> other <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=e363ce46-6a44-4584-9c5b-3c271473b1ba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> conducted almost entirely <em>before</em> the abortion story broke also showed a shift toward Warnock in recent weeks.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That raises the question: Did anything else happen in September that could have hurt Walker or helped Warnock? Well, Democrats did spend the month hammering Walker in TV ads over <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/democrats-emphasize-herschel-walkers-threats-ex-wife-new-georgia-ad-rcna45544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old allegations of domestic abuse</a>. According to the <a href="https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/releases-100622/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wesleyan Media Project</a>, from Sept. 19 to Oct. 2, there were 7,257 pro-Democrat ads in the race compared to 5,934 pro-Republican ads.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/herschel-walker-goodwill-georgia-win-senate-seat-89425858</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The most likely answer is that movement in the race is due to a combination of the abortion story and other preexisting factors like the Democrats’ TV advantage. Polling from InsiderAdvantage bears this out. The firm has actually surveyed Georgia four times in the last six weeks, giving us a more granular look at how the race has shifted (or hasn’t).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In InsiderAdvantage’s <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/new-insideradvantage-fox-5-poll-kemp-widens-lead-over-abrams-senate-race-remains-tight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept. 6-7 poll</a>, taken before both the abortion revelations and the last several weeks of Democratic advertising, Walker led 47 percent to 44 percent.  Then, the pollster was <a href="https://insideradvantage.com/2022/10/05/insideradvantagefox-5-poll-warnock-walker-still-in-statistical-tie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the field on Oct. 3</a> when the abortion story broke that evening. As a result, it decided to scrub that poll and start over the next day. No details were released about that Oct. 3 poll, which is why it doesn’t show up on our polls page, but the pollster did tease that it showed Warnock leading by 1 point. That suggests that the race moved 4 points toward Warnock between Sept. 6-7 and Oct. 3 (at least according to this one pollster).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">InsiderAdvantage then released the poll it took on Oct. 4, the day after the abortion story broke: It showed Warnock leading by 4 points. That suggests that the race moved an additional 3 points toward Warnock between Oct. 3 and Oct. 4 (i.e., after the abortion story broke). Of course, this is just one poll. But 3 points is still a lot of movement in just one day.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, InsiderAdvantage released a new poll just this week, conducted on Oct. 16. That poll — the one we used in the table above — gave Warnock a 3-point lead. So Walker may have started to recover from the bad headlines … or this may have just been an insignificant shift caused by normal polling error. (Again, all the other shifts are within the margin of error too — we only feel comfortable discussing them because other pollsters have shown similar things.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/races-bringing-democrats-odds-holding-senate-fivethirtyeight-91476350</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">There are still three weeks until Election Day, so this isn’t the final word on Walker’s fate. It’s possible that his scandals will become old news and Walker will (continue to?) recover in the polls. According to our forecast, there’s an 18-in-100 chance that this race will go to a runoff on Dec. 6. (If no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the general election, Georgia requires a runoff election to be held between the top two finishers.) That could mean even more time for Walker’s scandals to recede into the rearview mirror — or for another scandal to occur. So basically, don’t take your eyes off this race.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Throughout the primary season, Democrats caused a stir by involving themselves in Republican primary elections — often described as “meddling” — by spending money to boost potentially weaker GOP contenders in the hopes of improving Democrats’ chances in the general election. This brand of opposite-party meddling <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a25090/donald-segretti-ratfking-100413/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a long history</a> in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/18/democrats-primary-mastriano-lake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our politics</a>, but because the Republican candidates who stood to benefit in 2022 often embraced extreme positions such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denying the legitimacy of the 2020 election</a>, many observers — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/27/meijer-dccc-trump-primaries-00048104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including many Democrats</a> — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/01/democrats-risky-meddling-gop-primaries-00048962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were critical</a> of this interference.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic-aligned groups spent money in more than a dozen Republican primaries, and six of their preferred candidates won congressional or gubernatorial primaries, according to data compiled by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/12/democrats-interfere-republican-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>.

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s unclear to what extent Democratic interference actually altered the outcomes in these Republican primaries — and, in some cases, how much the primary’s outcome significantly altered the general election outlook. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, four of these six candidates had former President Donald Trump’s endorsement, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-endorsees-have-started-losing-more-but-dont-read-into-that-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted many Republican candidates</a> in primaries this cycle. Additionally, Democratic incumbents are defending three of these seats, potentially providing a small lift to Democratic chances in both New Hampshire races and Illinois’s gubernatorial election. And a couple of these contests are taking place on fairly blue turf, so they would have been more likely than not to favor Democrats regardless.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the Republican primary in Michigan’s 3rd District, the most competitive seat in this batch of races, former Trump administration official John Gibbs challenged Rep. Peter Meijer, one of 10 House Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who voted to impeach</a> Trump in 2021. Meijer <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-3-pro-impeachment-house-republicans-survive-tuesdays-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a huge spending advantage</a> in the primary, where a financial edge <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/F84C395D7155C9C0D82971BC0BFC75E8/S0003055422000764a.pdf/div-class-title-competition-in-congressional-elections-money-versus-votes-div.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can matter most;</a> Gibbs <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-congress-michigan-grand-rapids-impeachments-bfbb4564f73f2afdda6c5dbcb969c4ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had Trump’s endorsement</a>. Gibbs may have also received a boost from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/26/1113659467/dccc-meijier-gibbs-michigan-gop-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads run by</a> the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that ostensibly attacked him as “too conservative for West Michigan.” After Gibbs <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2022PRI_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly edged</a> Meijer by 3.5 percentage points, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast swung</a> from clearly favoring the GOP — we had Meijer as the default nominee until then — to favoring Democrat Hillary Scholten, whom Meijer <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2020GEN_CENR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated in 2020</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/peter-meijer-freshman-republican-impeach/620844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative anger toward Meijer</a> over impeachment and Trump’s endorsement of Gibbs made the primary race highly competitive from the get-go. Still, the DCCC’s spending probably didn’t hurt Gibbs, either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite Republicans being a longer shot, Democratic interference may have also tipped the scales in New Hampshire. The Republican primary for U.S. Senate saw a great deal of outside spending in the final weeks before deciding who would face potentially vulnerable Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. While they didn’t name retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc in their ads, Democratic-aligned groups <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/democratic-groups-spend-money-on-republican-primaries-to-nominate-less-appealing-opponents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent millions attacking</a> Bolduc’s main opponent, state Senate President Chuck Morse. National Republicans, meanwhile, spent millions to boost Morse <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/31/republican-super-pac-2-million-new-hampshire-senate-primary-00054402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the hopes of defeating</a> Bolduc, whom New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a fellow Republican, <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2022-08-19/sununu-says-he-wont-endorse-conspiracy-theory-type-bolduc-in-senate-republican-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">labeled</a> a “conspiracy-theory type” candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bolduc went on to finish <em>just</em> ahead of Morse, 37 percent to 36 percent. Morse <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-races-to-watch-in-new-hampshire-and-rhode-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had outraised Bolduc</a> and had ample outside support, and while <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-races-to-watch-in-new-hampshire-and-rhode-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolduc led</a> Morse in primary polls, <a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NewHampshireRepublicanSurvey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sizable number</a> of undecided voters in the campaign’s final weeks <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1701&amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested serious uncertainty</a> about the outcome. And the GOP’s crowded Senate primary race may have been more important to Bolduc’s victory than Democratic spending, as it <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/14/new-hampshire-election-analysis-dante-scala-gop-primary-maga-success/10377427002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complicated Morse’s ability to form</a> an anti-Bolduc coalition and helped Bolduc to eke out a win with a plurality of support.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in New Hampshire’s 2nd District, Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-hampshire/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is favored over</a> former Hillsborough County Treasurer Robert Burns. In the Republican primary, Burns faced Keene Mayor George Hansel, an abortion-rights supporter who outraised Burns and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00821652/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received outside backing</a> from a Republican PAC <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/detail/2022?cmte=C00821652&amp;tab=targeted_candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that opposed Trumpy candidates</a> in GOP primaries. But a Democratic-aligned group <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00774463/1634542/se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poured money</a> into ads ostensibly attacking Burns as an “unapologetic conservative.” Burns only won by 3 points, 33 percent to 30 percent; however, here too a crowded primary field probably helped the Trumpiest candidate. Moreover, while the 2nd District is highly competitive turf, Hansel would have been far from a sure bet to win himself, as Kuster has held the seat for five terms, including a <a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2014/11/05/it-s-official-kuster-re/36004635007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reelection victory</a> during 2014’s red wave.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Maryland and Illinois, the bluest-leaning races, it’s harder to say Democratic spending dramatically altered either the Republican primaries or the general election picture. (Both Democratic candidates are clear favorites, and given their states’ blue hues, would’ve likely been favored to some extent regardless of their opponent.) Illinois’s Democratic governor, J.B. Pritzker, and affiliated groups spent more than $30 million during the primary to portray state Sen. Darren Bailey as a pro-Trump Republican and attack his main GOP rival. Now, these ads probably benefited Bailey at least a bit as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/21-republican-primaries-and-a-special-election-to-watch-on-june-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his polling position improved</a> amid these efforts, and he went on to receive Trump’s endorsement. But Bailey also had <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/illinois-governors-race-is-also-battle-among-billionaires/2866399/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ample financial support</a> from GOP megadonor Richard Uihlein, and he ended up winning the primary by such a large margin — 42 points — that it’s difficult to imagine Bailey failing to win even if Democrats hadn’t become involved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Maryland, the Democratic Governors Association <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/02/dems-trump-hogan-maryland-00043837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent more than $1 million</a> portraying state Del. Dan Cox as “too close to Trump.” Cox, an election denier who <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/01/07/del-cox-arranged-buses-to-violent-trump-rally-calls-vice-president-a-traitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chartered buses to the Jan. 6 attack</a> on the U.S. Capitol, <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/11/22/with-trumps-backing-dan-coxs-gubernatorial-bid-gains-national-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had Trump’s endorsement, while</a> former Maryland Secretary of Commerce Kelly Schulz had the support of <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/11/whitmers-approval-ticks-up-in-michigan-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular outgoing</a> Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. Despite being significantly outraised by Shultz, Cox wound up defeating his opponent 52 percent to 43 percent in the July 19 primary, and is now <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a huge underdog</a> against Democrat Wes Moore.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for Pennsylvania, the gubernatorial contest arguably should have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-gop-could-make-or-break-its-chances-in-10-key-governors-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the GOP’s best chance at victory</a> out of these six races. But Republican voters opted for state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a far-right candidate who <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/doug-mastriano-governor-christian-nationalism-qanon-20220504.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has embraced Christian nationalism</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/14/politics/trump-pennsylvania-mastriano-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked to overturn</a> the 2020 election results and <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-video-appears-to-show-state-sen-mastriano-closer-to-capitol-riot-than-he-said/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was on the grounds</a> of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Throughout the primary campaign, Democratic gubernatorial nominee and state Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Pennsylvania Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2022/05/18/takeaways-from-the-biggest-primary-night-of-the-year-00033345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent close to $1 million</a> on ads portraying Mastriano as “one of Donald Trump’s strongest supporters.” (Trump wound up <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-endorses-doug-mastriano-ahead-of-pennsylvania-gop-governor-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing his support</a> for Mastriano just days before the May 17 primary.) Shapiro is a strong bet to defeat Mastriano in November, as he holds about an 11-point edge <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our polling average</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But before Democrats take all the credit — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/19/mastriano-pennsylvania-governor-race-00046423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or blame</a> — for Mastriano’s advancement, it doesn’t take a tremendous leap to imagine him capturing the GOP nomination without Democratic assistance. After all, Mastriano won the GOP primary by more than 20 points. Stop me if you’ve heard this before, but a more important factor may have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/16-gop-primaries-to-watch-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania-idaho-and-oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the crowded primary field</a>, which hampered attempts by anti-Mastriano Republicans to coalesce around one candidate. In fact, a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-republican-governor-doug-mastriano-election-20220510.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last-minute effort</a> by Pennsylvania Republican insiders to stop Mastriano failed in part because they couldn’t coax Mastriano’s main rivals to drop out and rally behind one candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hindsight may help assess whether Democratic involvement affected some or all of these races, but it’s clear that myriad factors influenced the primary outcomes. And even if Democrats shifted each race and improved their chances, perhaps only New Hampshire’s Senate contest would notably affect which party controls either chamber of Congress and the nation’s governorships. Whether all this was worth the intangible cost of aiding candidates who mostly deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election while Congress works to unravel the events of Jan. 6 is another matter entirely.</p>]]></description>
