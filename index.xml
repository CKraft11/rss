For the third time in six years, the justices will consider the constitutionality of a state law designed to restrict abortion — this time, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Mississippi ban</a> on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. And because the court is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more conservative than it’s been in decades</a>, many experts believe <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/18/supreme-court-just-took-case-that-could-kill-roe-v-wade-or-let-it-die-slowly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s a real possibility</a> that the justices will use this case to overturn — or at least severely limit — the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 by Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roe may be one of the only Supreme Court decisions that most Americans can identify. In all likelihood, it’s more familiar to the average voter than the names of <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/403992-poll-more-than-half-of-americans-cant-name-single-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any justice</a> currently serving on the Supreme Court. Surprisingly, though, trying to understand what Americans think about abortion rights — and how they’d react if Roe was reversed or reshaped — can feel like walking into a fogbank. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ask Americans whether Roe should be overruled, and the answer seems pretty straightforward: Polls consistently find that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority think</a> the Supreme Court should keep the ruling in place. But Americans’ views on abortion are hardly clear-cut. Majorities also support <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730183531/poll-majority-want-to-keep-abortion-legal-but-they-also-want-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a variety of restrictions on abortion</a> — including limits on abortion in the second trimester — that openly conflict with the Supreme Court’s rulings. For example, <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation poll found</a> that 69 percent of Americans favored laws requiring abortions to be performed only by doctors who had admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, even though <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court ruled in 2016</a> that those laws place an unconstitutional burden on women’s right to abortion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why is it so hard to distill views on an issue that’s been at the forefront of American politics <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2013/01/16/a-history-of-key-abortion-rulings-of-the-us-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for nearly five decades</a>? Given the longstanding, intractable division on abortion, one might think that Americans hold murky views because they’re actively, even painfully, wrestling with the matter. But that’s not what I found when I dug into the issue. The truth is that many Americans just don’t like talking or thinking about abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also don’t know a lot about the procedure or restrictions around it, and when it comes to the politics of abortion, they see an endless loop. In interviews, people told me over and over again that they want the country to find a quiet middle ground — yet the debate keeps getting more heated and extreme.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Fuck no, I don’t talk to people about abortion,” said Jeremy, a 34-year-old man who asked me not to disclose his last name and location. “I have other political discussions with my friends, and we can do pretty well on that. But the second I would say, ‘I think there should be reasonable limits on abortion after the first trimester,’ people would jump down my throat.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abortion also isn’t an especially high political priority for people like Jeremy, despite — or perhaps because of — its ubiquitousness. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vy4b1z4v2q/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a YouGov/The Economist poll</a> conducted in October, only 4 percent of Americans ranked abortion as their top issue, coming in behind jobs and the economy, climate change, immigration, health care, taxes and civil rights. “I think people are tired [of this issue] and they hate it at election time,” said Tresa Undem, a researcher at the nonpartisan firm PerryUndem who studies attitudes toward abortion. “They think politicians are pandering for votes.” Instead, according to Undem, many Americans think both sides of the debate are right — and wrong. “It’s kind of like, ‘Yes, abortion is ending a potential life, and yes, women should be able to make a choice. Move on.’”</p>



<h2><strong>Most Americans fall into a gray zone on abortion</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, perspectives on abortion tend to fall into three main camps. The first camp is a relatively small chunk of Americans (about 10 to 15 percent) who think abortion should be illegal in all cases. The second camp is a larger minority (about 25 to 30 percent) who want abortion to be legal in all cases. And the third camp is the majority of Americans (about 55 to 65 percent), who fall into a gray area, telling pollsters that they want abortion to be legal in some or most cases. That final category is all over the place, as it includes both people who think abortion should be legal only in cases of rape, incest and when the mother’s life is at risk, as well as people who think abortion should be legal with only limited restrictions, perhaps for minors or for abortions in later stages of pregnancy.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1022" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ATD-ABORTION-META-POLLING-1@2x.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ATD-ABORTION-META-POLLING-1@2x.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ATD-ABORTION-META-POLLING-1@2x.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ATD-ABORTION-META-POLLING-1@2x.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It may be hard to know how most people really feel about abortion, but one important takeaway from this data is that the vast majority of Americans — somewhere between 85 and 90 percent, according to most polls — think abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances. Total bans on abortion, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which have now passed in three states</a>, are popular only with a small sliver of the public. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But most Americans support at least some restrictions on abortion, too. “I lean more toward the pro-life side of things, and I don’t think abortion is something that should just be available to everyone all the time, but I also don’t like how everyone is so extreme,” said Amanda, 38. She asked me to withhold identifying information, such as her last name and location, because she feels caught between her family, which is staunchly anti-abortion, and her liberal friends. When I asked her where the line should be drawn, she suggested a ban on abortion somewhere between 12 and 20 weeks. “I think that would be a good, moderate middle ground,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly identifying an acceptable middle ground on abortion isn’t easy for most people to do, though. That’s in part because many Americans don’t know much about abortion to begin with, and perhaps as a result, their views aren’t usually more specific than a belief that the procedure should be available in at least some cases.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/235469/trimesters-key-abortion-views.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup has consistently found</a> that while a majority (around 60 percent) of Americans thought abortion should be generally legal in the first trimester of pregnancy, much smaller shares thought abortion should be generally illegal in the second trimester (nearly 30 percent), although Roe protects the right to abortion until the last few weeks of the second trimester, when the fetus <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/obstetric-care-consensus/articles/2017/10/periviable-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be able to survive</a> outside the womb. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1151" height="1872" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ATD-ABORTION-META-POLLING-2@2x.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ATD-ABORTION-META-POLLING-2@2x.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ATD-ABORTION-META-POLLING-2@2x.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ATD-ABORTION-META-POLLING-2@2x.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These contradictions show up elsewhere, too. According to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730183531/poll-majority-want-to-keep-abortion-legal-but-they-also-want-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/upshot/politicians-draw-clear-lines-on-abortion-their-parties-are-not-so-unified.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the General Social Survey</a>, Americans are much likelier to support abortion rights when the woman’s health is endangered than if she wants an abortion for another reason. The NPR poll found that 61 percent of respondents favored a level of restriction beyond the current standard under Roe. And the 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that Americans mostly supported some restrictions on abortion access, like a mandatory ultrasound before an abortion can be obtained. But that same Kaiser also poll found that only 28 percent of Americans thought it was too easy to get an abortion, and a majority (61 percent) wanted their state to protect women’s access to abortion. <a href="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6100683/Vox_Final_Toplines__1_.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2016 Vox/PerryUndem survey</a> found that majorities of Americans also thought that women should be able to get a legal abortion in their own community, without facing pressure to change their mind.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lack of knowledge about reproductive health in general is a huge issue for researchers like <a href="https://publichealth.indiana.edu/research/faculty-directory/profile.html?user=knjozkow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristen Jozkowski</a>, a professor of sexual health at Indiana University, who are trying to figure out what Americans think about abortion. “People don’t understand something as basic as gestational age,” Jozkowski said. That makes it quite difficult to figure out what they think about, for instance, a 15-week abortion ban, which requires a fairly nuanced understanding of how pregnancies develop. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In general, Americans think abortions happen later in a pregnancy than they typically do — and very few know that only a small share of abortions happen late in pregnancy. Many people think <a href="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6100683/Vox_Final_Toplines__1_.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortions are much less safe than they are</a>, too. And according to the Vox/PerryUndem survey, most aren’t aware of what abortion restrictions are on the books in their own area. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7409738/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2020 study focusing on women found</a> that respondents correctly answered only 18 percent of questions about abortion regulations in their state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most people also aren’t aware of what would happen in their own state if Roe v. Wade were overturned. According to that 2020 Kaiser poll, only 38 percent of people living in <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states with “trigger laws”</a> knew that abortion would immediately become illegal in their state, and only 35 percent of people in states without trigger laws knew that abortion would stay legal. This means that when people are answering questions about whether Roe should be overturned, most don’t have an accurate sense of what reversing the ruling would mean for their state and community.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, when people are surveyed about whether they support a specific abortion restriction, they often lack key information that would shape their answer. On that same Kaiser poll, for instance, support for an abortion ban after fetal cardiac activity can be detected dropped from 49 percent to 38 percent after respondents were told that many women don’t know they’re pregnant at that point. Similarly, support for an admitting privileges requirement also fell from 69 percent to 52 percent after respondents were told that complications from abortion are very rare and that, when they do happen, women can get hospital care regardless of whether the abortion provider has admitting privileges.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Simple things like one’s own life experience can also shape people’s perspectives. Rachael, 40, who asked me to withhold her last name and location, said that although she supports abortion rights, she understood why someone would want to ban abortion “a bit better” after she had children. “Once you’ve had a relationship with someone that’s not born, it’s easier to feel that sense of like – this is a life, this is a human being.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in many cases, people’s responses may appear ambiguous because they think they simply shouldn’t be making the call about such a personal decision — and neither should politicians. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/nov-7-10-2021-washington-post-abc-news-poll/160508a9-cea2-4433-92c8-6dc51838721e/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to an ABC News/The Washington Post poll</a> conducted in early November, 75 percent of Americans thought abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor, while only 20 percent thought it should be regulated by law. Beverly, who lives in Ohio and asked me to withhold her last name and other identifying details, said that she personally thought it was wrong for someone to have an abortion because they thought they couldn’t afford to have a child, but that she still thought abortion should be legal. “I wish politicians would see moral issues as being out of scope for them. It’s not what they were selected for,” she said.</p>



<h2><strong>Abortion isn’t a high priority for most Americans, either</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s taken as gospel these days that abortion is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-may-now-motivate-democrats-more-than-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a high political priority</a>, but that’s only true for a small subset of people. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polling routinely shows</a> that when Americans are asked to rank their political priorities, abortion falls low on the list. And that actually makes sense, given that most Americans don’t have especially well-formed views on abortion, and many in that middle gray area tend to think the issue is already too political, and that the parties don’t represent them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abigail Lilly, 29, who lives in West Virginia, told me that she didn’t see her position reflected in the political debate over abortion. “The more conservative [perspective] I’ve heard recently is ‘No abortion whatsoever,’” she said, adding that, as a rape survivor, such a view was particularly difficult for her to understand. “I couldn’t imagine having gotten pregnant from that and being forced to carry that child.” But she was also in favor of some limits on abortion, and she disagreed with what she saw as the position of many on the left — namely, that abortion should be legal at any point during a pregnancy. In reality, abortion after 21 weeks of pregnancy <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is extremely rare</a>, and even in blue states, it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/02/06/tough-questions-answers-late-term-abortions-law-women-who-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tends to occur</a> only in extreme circumstances, such as when the mother’s health is endangered or when the fetus isn’t viable. But <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/30/718546468/opponents-fight-efforts-to-protect-late-term-abortion-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much of the recent debate</a> has focused on abortions later in pregnancy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And then there’s the fact that many people simply don’t think abortion rights are in imminent danger. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/anoy7rtkl2/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A YouGov/Economist poll conducted</a> in November found that only 13 percent of Americans thought that it was very likely that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe. It also found that while most (81 percent) Americans said they’d heard at least something about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new law in Texas</a> — which that bans abortion before many women know they’re pregnant — a much smaller share (43 percent) had heard about the Mississippi law, which is going before the Supreme Court today. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Undem, it’s unusual for abortion issues to catch the average American’s attention. “There has to be sustained news coverage for it to break through,” she said. That helps explain why abortion access has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-categorized-hundreds-of-abortion-restrictions-heres-why-the-anti-abortion-movement-is-escalating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so successfully curtailed over the past ten years</a>, with very little public outcry. Many people who support abortion rights in the abstract don’t follow the issue closely and almost certainly haven’t dug into the complex latticework of restrictions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The new Texas law, though, may be the rare exception. Undem conducted focus groups in Texas shortly after the restriction went into effect, and she found that many people knew about the law and were upset by it. “I heard things that I’ve never heard about after any other type of restriction,” she said. “They were realizing this actually has an impact on women.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, abortion <em>can</em> become a salient issue under the right circumstances. Amanda, who told me she wanted a middle ground, said the Texas law went too far for her. “That one is very difficult for me because I do consider myself pro-life, but six weeks is just so early,” she said. “I get where that would be an issue for a lot of people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That underscores the potential risk for the Supreme Court this term. The six-justice conservative majority may be open to overturning Roe — but that would likely spur a backlash. On the other hand, though, the court still has plenty of latitude. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trumps-supreme-court-could-overturn-roe-v-wade-without-overturning-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s a lot of room</a> to further restrict abortion rights without putting a stake through the heart of one of the highest-profile Supreme Court decisions in history. And if that’s the path the court chooses, it might be surprisingly hard to get most Americans to care. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In today’s hyperpartisan political climate, members of Congress risk losing support when they deviate from their party’s position on important votes. In fact, over the past year, we’ve already seen this play out twice for Republicans in the House of Representatives.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, 10 House Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infuriated their colleagues and the party’s base</a> by voting to impeach outgoing President Trump after his incitement of the Jan. 6 insurrection. Then in early November, 13 House Republicans voted for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/11/05/house-infrastructure-reconciliation-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 trillion infrastructure bill</a> put forward by Democrats. They have faced <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/06/fix-gop-infrastructure-defections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiery denunciations from within the GOP</a> for backing it, with many Republicans accusing the representatives of helping President Biden and Democrats move their agenda forward.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The repercussions for crossing party lines have been swift. In the case of the 10 Republicans who voted for impeachment, all attracted <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-will-survive-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least one intraparty challenger</a> — of these challengers, Trump has endorsed five — and two even called it quits, knowing they’d struggle to win reelection. The fallout for the 13 Republicans who backed the infrastructure bill hasn’t been as widespread, but already two of the nine who voted for the infrastructure bill alone <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-house-members-voted-infrastructure-paying-political-price/story?id=81114299" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have attracted notable primary opponents</a>. And it’s possible that more primary opposition could emerge in the coming weeks, as many on the right <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/greene-boebert-gosar-gaetz/2021/11/20/c77dc78a-47dd-11ec-973c-be864f938c72_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have called for the ouster of the pro-infrastructure House Republicans</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-primary-battles-against-rinos-infrastructure-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Trump himself</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, though, it’s mostly the four Republicans who also voted to impeach Trump who face serious primary challenges. To be sure, five Republicans who voted for just the infrastructure bill do face a primary challenger, but only two of them are serious by our count.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Much of the opposition to the four who backed impeachment long predated the infrastructure vote, too. The principal primary challengers to Reps. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-catalina-lauf-challenge-kinzinger-congress-16th-district-20210224-rohj5knnhvfknnxxdjslqzzkny-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced their campaigns in February 2021</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/us/politics/anthony-gonzalez-ohio-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gonzalez</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/29/1050454729/gop-rep-adam-kinzinger-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-wont-run-for-reelection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinzinger announced</a> their retirements in mid-September and late October, respectively — before the infrastructure vote. Meanwhile, Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and John Katko of New York are still seeking reelection, but their primary challengers announced <a href="https://www.sturgisjournal.com/story/news/2021/04/08/steve-carra-announces-2022-bid-district-6-congressional-seat/7141372002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the spring</a> and <a href="https://auburnpub.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/rep-john-katko-gets-gop-primary-challenger/article_51667a90-228b-5604-89f1-d2759b84e642.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summer</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the nine Republicans who voted for the infrastructure bill but not impeachment, most have avoided high-profile intraparty challengers. One of them — New York Rep. Tom Reed — actually decided to retire earlier this year after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/tom-reed-lobbyist-nicolette-davis/2021/03/19/10717562-84f3-11eb-8a67-f314e5fcf88d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegations of sexual misconduct</a>, and of the remaining eight, only two have more than nominal primary opposition at this point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But of that pair, West Virginia Rep. David McKinley is probably the most endangered because he now faces a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/wv-state-wire-west-virginia-charleston-redistricting-david-mckinley-8223ba3a5f15351c98d1dcc8e7098dfb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary battle</a> against fellow GOP Rep. Alex Mooney.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKinley does have at least one other minor primary challenger &lt;a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00775155/?cycle=2022&amp;amp;tab=filings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;who filed back in April&lt;/a&gt;, but the primary will mainly be a contest between McKinley and Mooney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Virginia lost a congressional district</a> in the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once-in-a-decade redistricting process</a>, which means McKinley and Mooney will now face off against each other in a district that merges most of their previous districts, and troublingly for McKinley in a state that <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=54&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for Trump by 39 percentage points</a>, Mooney has earned <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/15/trump-west-virginia-mooney-mckinley-522608" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s backing</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s likely the infrastructure vote played a part in the timing of Trump’s endorsement, too. The former president announced he’d back Mooney just two days after he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-primary-battles-against-rinos-infrastructure-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a statement</a> encouraging “America First Republican Patriots” to run against the Republicans who voted for the infrastructure deal. McKinley’s vote may have been the final straw for the former president, who praised Mooney’s vote against the infrastructure bill in his endorsement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not yet clear how much Alaska Rep. Don Young’s infrastructure vote will be a problem for him as his most notable challenger launched <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/10/28/in-wasilla-nick-begich-iii-officially-launches-campaign-for-don-youngs-us-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his campaign</a> before the infrastructure vote, but Young, the House’s longest-serving current member, might finally have a serious challenger in Nick Begich III.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Begich is the grandson of the man Young replaced in 1973, Democratic Rep. Nick Begich, <a href="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2019/09/18/plane-carrying-cokie-roberts-father-disappeared-in-alaska-in-1972-it-was-never-found/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who disappeared in a plane while campaigning</a> just before the 1972 election. Unlike his grandfather and <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/10/22/nick-begich-republican-son-of-alaskas-leading-democratic-family-will-run-for-us-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much of his family</a>, however, the younger Begich is a Republican. So far, he’s centered his campaign against the 88-year-old Young around a message of generational change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, too, Begich <a href="https://clubforgrowthfoundation.org/fellow/nicholas-begich-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a fellow</a> at the Club for Growth Foundation. That might matter because the limited-government-oriented Club for Growth <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/scorecards/legislator/Y000033/Don-Young/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has never rated Young highly</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2008/06/club-for-growth-endorses-challenger-to-young-009501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has previously endorsed at least one of his past primary challengers</a>. The Club’s <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/club-for-growth-action-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign arm often spends large sums</a> on behalf of its endorsed candidates, too, although it has not yet offered a 2022 Alaska endorsement. But even if the Club for Growth doesn’t endorse Begich, Alaska’s new <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonpartisan top-four primary</a> means Begich could still advance, as his challenge won’t happen in the confines of a traditional party primary. Instead, they’ll be competing in a primary where candidates from all parties are running together on the same ballot, so <em>both</em> Young and Begich could advance to the general election if they finish among the top-four vote-getters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for the other six House Republicans who backed only the infrastructure bill and are set to run again in 2022, it’s possible that they may not attract serious primary opposition. After all, voting for infrastructure funding is not as politically risky as voting to impeach a president from one’s own party. Plus, all 13 Republicans who backed the infrastructure bill <a href="https://voteview.com/congress/house/-1/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rank as fairly moderate</a>, so a vote for infrastructure wasn’t exactly a departure from their past voting behavior, especially as most of them represent districts in or around major metropolitan areas that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rep-malliotakis-the-1-2-infrastructure-bill-is-incredibly-important-for-aging-cities-like-new-york" target="_blank" rel="noopener">need infrastructure dollars</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These Republicans’ infrastructure votes might rankle some Republicans, but that may be a feature, not a bug, because many of these members also represent (potentially) competitive turf where winning over swing voters helps ensure victory. As Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon <a href="https://www.axios.com/house-republicans-votes-infrastructure-biden-9d3ea43c-835e-4a85-a3d8-6071287b9688.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Axios</a>, “You vote one way, maybe it hurts in the primary. You vote the other way … in my district, it’d hurt me in the general.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, Reps. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, Nicole Malliotakis of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania might avoid a major primary challenge because Trump hasn’t targeted them in the same way as other pro-infrastructure House Republicans. In his Nov. 13 statement <a href="https://twitter.com/EricMGarcia/status/1459673729584312320?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listing off House Republicans he felt should be taken down</a>, Trump notably left off their names. Trump also recently said that, despite her vote, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/21/rep-nicole-malliotakis-still-backed-by-trump-after-infrastructure-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he still supports Malliotakis</a>, whose district includes Staten Island, where Trump still holds a strong appeal. And Van Drew <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/19/trump-meet-party-switching-van-drew-087976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famously switched parties</a> in December 2019 after opposing Trump’s impeachment, which may well have been why Trump didn’t mention him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/politics/republicans-backlash-infrastructure-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fury directed</a> at these relatively moderate, pro-infrastructure Republicans might still yield a few serious, Trump-minded challenges from the right. After all, political scientists <a href="http://www.cfinst.org/pdf/papers/Boatright_2014_Primaries_in_Context_9-30-14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have observed an increase in ideologically based primary challenges</a> in recent years. To be clear, those efforts have mostly been unsuccessful — <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2-7-Full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few House incumbents lose renomination</a> — but the infrastructure vote could provide an impetus for a primary opponent. It’s also been less than a month since the infrastructure vote, so prospective candidates looking to answer the call for primary challengers may still be ramping up their campaigns. The <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/11/11/2062095/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2022-primary-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate filing deadline</a> hasn’t passed in a single state where a Republican backed the infrastructure bill; most aren’t until March 2022 at the earliest. Moreover, states like New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have yet to finish redistricting</a>, so there might still be big changes in store for these incumbents that <a href="https://c62a1cd8-e60b-4682-b2c5-a937642d5637.filesusr.com/ugd/7d6421_47efef1c597a49baa040b1f1c80b5461.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make them more vulnerable in a primary</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Right now, though, it doesn’t appear that the House Republicans who voted for infrastructure but not impeachment will face the same degree of primary opposition as those who voted to impeach Trump. However, that doesn’t mean we won’t see the emergence of a few more serious primary challengers who cite the infrastructure vote as a key motivation for getting into a race. We’ll be watching to see if the infrastructure vote joins impeachment as a major factor in determining which incumbents face the gloomiest primary prospects in 2022.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Pollsters are already turning their attention to the 2024 election, and they want to know whether Americans want a rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. Polls show that solid majorities of U.S. adults — in the range of about <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/national/2021/11_10_2021_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=21DA13926A698BE7C00BBD01E6C64B8F5D9BB574" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60</a> to <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent</a> — don’t want either to run next time.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Violent crime is up. Data from the FBI found that the murder rate increased <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/27/1040904770/fbi-data-murder-increase-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 30 percent</a> in 2020. And homicides <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/us/us-homicides-rise-in-2021/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue to rise</a> in 2021 as well, if not by quite as much. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans have noticed. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/323996/perceptions-increased-crime-highest-1993.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll</a> released in November 2020 found that 78 percent of Americans thought that the national crime rate was higher than the year before — the highest that number has been since 1993, when it was 87 percent. More recently, an October report from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a> found that 61 percent of Americans said violent crime was “a very big problem” in the U.S. today — a 20-percentage-point jump from roughly a year earlier. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite polls showing that Americans are increasingly worried about crime, there are a few reasons to believe that it may not be a large issue in the midterm elections next year. The biggest of which is that crime doesn’t offer a clear advantage to either political party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2749726?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Past scholarship</a> has found that political parties have built-in advantages on certain issues. And historically, the public has expressed greater confidence in the GOP’s handling of the issue of crime. For instance, a <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/study/31086640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1985 ABC News/The Washington Post poll</a> found that Republicans had a nearly 20-point advantage over Democrats on the issue. But there’s evidence that <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4151362?seq=4#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Clinton’s rhetoric and policies</a> diminished the GOP’s advantage, leaving the two parties pretty evenly matched — a balance that has maintained to this day. Case in point: A June poll from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/june-27-30-2021-washington-post-abc-news-poll/9f67b281-b289-4e67-a9e1-9515018d7e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC News/The Washington Post</a> showed almost no difference in which party Americans trusted more to handle crime (35 percent for Democrats, 36 for Republicans).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if there is an opening to make crime a campaign issue, it is probably linked to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-like-the-ideas-behind-defunding-the-police-more-than-the-slogan-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“defund the police” movement</a> championed by some progressive activists and local Democratic leaders. Since its popularization during last summer’s protests, the slogan has been controversial and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/08/poll-worries-crime-most-say-police-dont-treat-all-equally/7880911002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poorly received by the public</a>, even as it captured widespread media attention. In fact, most polling, including <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/public-places-and-commercial-spaces-how-neighborhood-amenities-foster-trust-and-connection-in-american-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my own</a>, finds the public largely opposed to cutting law enforcement budgets. However, despite GOP efforts to cast the idea as a mainstream Democratic proposal, it has garnered very little support from the party establishment. President Biden, for instance, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/politics/defunding-police-biden-town-hall-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been clear in his opposition</a> to defunding the police.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Furthermore, as crime spiked across the country last year, even the elected Democrats who had touted proposals to reallocate law enforcement funding or disband police departments quickly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/murders-surge-democrats-find-new-message-fund-police-2021-08-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reversed course</a>. For example, more than a year after the Minneapolis City Council pledged to disband the city’s police department, the mayor is now seeking to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-policing-murder-rate/2021/06/26/e37c38fc-d4fd-11eb-ae54-515e2f63d37d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire more officers</a>. And earlier this month, voters in Minneapolis decisively <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/02/1051617581/minneapolis-police-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected a ballot measure</a> that would have replaced the police department with a health-oriented Department of Public Safety. In <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cities-reverse-defunding-the-police-amid-rising-crime-11622066307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oakland and Los Angeles</a>, local lawmakers are also now looking to increase funding for police departments.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we look ahead to 2022, there’s a good chance the issue will not reemerge. Consider a <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/racing-apart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by the Voter Study Group</a> that found that immediately after the murder of George Floyd, positive views of the police sank sharply among Democrats. However, over the next six months, Democratic views turned much more positive. And today, Democrats have mostly favorable views of the police.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The uptick in crime might not affect as many people as it once did, either. This past July, in Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/07/25/pandemic-crime-politics-1970s-election-500653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historian Josh Zeitz suggested</a> that crime resonated as a political issue in the past because its effect was immediately apparent. He said that, in the 1970s, “many working-class and middle-class voters lived in cities or inner-ring suburbs where crime was not a hypothetical concern; it was an everyday reality.” But recent trends in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/why-are-americans-so-geographically-polarized/575881/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geographic polarization</a> have shown that the places experiencing the greatest surge in crime today — <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/public-places-and-commercial-spaces-how-neighborhood-amenities-foster-trust-and-connection-in-american-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cities and inner suburbs</a>, according to the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life, where I serve as director — are largely Democratic strongholds. In other words, there are simply not that many swing voters living in the areas most affected by rising violence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the current political climate may be the most important reason why crime will likely remain on the periphery in 2022. Even if there is an opening for Republicans to exploit the issue, they may decide they don’t need to. The Virginia and New Jersey elections suggest Democrats will be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/resist-the-pundits-what-the-2021-elections-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing strong headwinds</a> in the coming midterm elections, no matter what. For the time being, Biden’s approval is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stuck in the low 40s</a>, which is <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/356504/biden-job-approval-steady-lower-level.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the lowest of his term so far</a>, and the White House’s party typically struggles in off-year elections. The public mood is also grim. The percentage of Americans who believe the country is moving in the wrong direction <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has surged over the past few months</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given that we’re not entirely certain what is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/murders-spiked-in-2020-how-will-that-change-the-politics-of-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing the uptick in crime</a>, it’s hard to predict what things will look like next year. For instance, if crime is being partly driven by the pandemic, then it’s possible — perhaps even likely — that the crime rate could abate as vaccine uptake continues and cases decline. A lot can happen in 12 months, but it’s a good bet that crime won’t be the top issue in 2022.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Kyle Rittenhouse’s trial may have ended, but his veneration is only beginning. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Friday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/11/19/rittenhouse-verdict-live-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a jury acquitted Rittenhouse</a> on all charges after he shot three men, killing two and injuring one, during protests against the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. Ever since the shootings, far-right groups online have fixated on Rittenhouse as a hero who was being unfairly tried, essentially turning him into <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/jan-6-has-given-the-right-hundreds-of-new-martyrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of their many living martyrs</a>. A far-right group with 12,500 followers on Telegram, a chat-messaging app, posted daily updates on what it dubbed “the trial of Saint Kyle.” These groups also fixated on the <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/09/11/rittenhouse-victims-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criminal backgrounds</a> of the men Rittenhouse shot, mocked their deaths and celebrated the verdict by calling for more violence. Now, as Rittenhouse receives <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-celebrate-rittenhouse-verdict-1260353/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not only adulation but internship offers</a> from Republicans in Congress, his wide adoption as a right-wing martyr — a phenomenon previously only really embraced by the extreme right — marks just how much closer far-right and mainstream Republicans have gotten. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On far-right message boards and chat groups, celebrations erupted immediately following the verdict. “It’s over. America wins. We can officially celebrate,” read one comment on Patriots.win, a pro-Trump forum that evolved out of the now-banned r/TheDonald subreddit. Many posters wrote that they were crying with relief and happiness. Their approval of the verdict reflects the broader Republican opinion: According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/22/rittenhouse-verdict-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling from Morning Consult</a> over the weekend, 71 percent of Republicans said they approved of the jury’s decision. But posts quickly devolved into calls for further violence, with many saying they could “reference this case” to defend violent acts. Using slurs for antifa and the Black Lives Matter movement, one poster on Patriots.win said that those two groups “gotta be shitting. We have permission to defend ourselves now.” Another poster responded: “We don’t need fucking permission and never did. But now, it’s legal precedent.” (It should be noted that posters on anonymous message boards are not known for their legal expertise.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many posters on the extreme right also called for Rittenhouse to sue media companies whose coverage of the trial they deemed unfair or defamatory, citing Nicholas Sandmann, another conservative teenage martyr, whose family sued The Washington Post over <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/24/media/washington-post-sandmann-settlement-lawsuit/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coverage of a viral video</a> in which Sandmann, who was attending a March for Life rally, encountered Omaha tribe elder Nathan Phillips in 2019. The Post settled with the Sandmann family, and many posters said Rittenhouse should seek similar lawsuits. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans and right-wing media have taken advantage of Rittenhouse’s darling status among both the mainstream and far right. Fox News already has a widely promoted one-on-one interview with Rittenhouse set to air during “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Monday.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/kyle-rittenhouse-tucker-carlson-first-interview-after-acquittal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;clip of this interview&lt;/a&gt;, in which Rittenhouse says “I support the BLM movement,” caused some consternation among the far right, which largely opposes the movement, with some going so far as to call it a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/08/09/black-lives-matter-is-not-a-terrorist-organisation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;terrorist organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> Fox News also published a story Saturday suggesting Rittenhouse could have a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/rittenhouse-defamation-biden-tweet" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.foxnews.com/us/rittenhouse-defamation-biden-tweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defamation case</a> against President Biden. Meanwhile, Republican politicians have praised the verdict and Rittenhouse. Former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0lReIesfZE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called into Fox News Friday evening</a> to say he thought that Rittenhouse was “brave” for testifying and that the verdict was a “great decision”; Trump also asserted that the case was baseless to begin with — a common refrain on the far right. Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar, and Madison Cawthorn all seemed to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-celebrate-rittenhouse-verdict-1260353/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer Rittenhouse internships</a>. (No word on whether they’re paid or unpaid.) Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the state where the shootings took place, <a href="https://twitter.com/SenRonJohnson/status/1461766292080316427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1461766292080316427%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Frepublicans-celebrate-rittenhouse-verdict-1260353%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted that justice had been served</a>, and Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky <a href="https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1461763089876017152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1461763089876017152%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Frepublicans-celebrate-rittenhouse-verdict-1260353%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted a video of the verdict</a> being read with the caption: “There is hope for this country.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rittenhouse’s evolution into a right-wing martyr is a product of the highly politicized nature of his case and the circumstances surrounding the shootings. The case weaved together multiple issues over which there is stark partisan division, including gun rights and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/03/908878610/americans-increasingly-polarized-when-it-comes-to-racial-justice-protests-poll-f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests over police brutality</a>. But it’s also a part of a long history on the far right of raising certain figures to holy status, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/jan-6-has-given-the-right-hundreds-of-new-martyrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I’ve previously reported</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Almost immediately after he was identified as the shooter last year, Rittenhouse was elevated to a quasi-saint status among the right. This marked the first time this phenomenon occurred in a major way among the mainstream right in America. Since then, we’ve seen it repeating. Take the individuals charged with participating in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol who have attracted support in the form of fundraisers and rallies. Rittenhouse’s place amid the right-wing hagiography demonstrates how much the far right and the mainstream right have converged, with members of Congress who send out pithy tweets and extreme posters on message boards who call for violence all praying at the same altar of St. Kyle. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Back in 2018, a quartet of Democratic women — known commonly as “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/23/squad-congress-how-aoc-omar-tlaib-and-pressley-got-name/1804557001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Squad</a>” — broke barriers on their way to Congress: They were young women of color with no prior congressional experience who, in some cases, bested a white incumbent to represent their now racially diversifying districts. They were heralded as the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/opinion/the-squad-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future of the Democratic Party,</a>” and, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rashida-tlaib-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-dsa-democratic-socialists-of-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the progressive movement</a>, which had long struggled to make inroads with nonwhite voters, they offered a potential path forward: These four women, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/aoc-squad-are-getting-some-company-here-s-who-joining-n1250958" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and others like them</a>, would motivate people of color to vote for left-leaning candidates to help usher in a seismic shift in electoral politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/21/progressive-democrats-reset-449496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then the 2020 election</a> happened. The Squad <a href="https://www.instyle.com/politics-social-issues/177th-congress-squad-cori-bush-jamaal-bowman" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>did </em>grow by two members</a>, but progressives failed to win the ultimate prize, the Democratic nomination for president, in large part because voters of color threw their support behind now-President Biden. In addition, many Democrats argued after the 2020 general election that progressive messaging might have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-2020-autopsy-midterms/2021/05/18/6114af82-b80d-11eb-a5fe-bb49dc89a248_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost Democrats seats in the House</a> that year. And while a handful of nonwhite progressive candidates <a href="https://www.governing.com/young-progressives-of-color-win-many-but-not-all-mayoral-contests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have won important elections this year</a>, 2021 also contained a number of high-profile setbacks for the movement. Not only did Eric Adams, a Black moderate, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-government-and-politics-209b2feb740ea6db4d3a2277e8fb38d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handily defeat a number of progressives</a> in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, but <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/buffalo-election-2021-results-india-walton-defeated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful</a> of other <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-shontel-brown-beat-nina-turner-ohio-primary_n_6116e717e4b01da700f5cb85" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressives of color</a> lost their races to more moderate politicians of color, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, the buzz over the Squad’s initial wins in 2018 has largely been replaced by a narrative that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/26/us/politics/progressives-black-latino-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressives struggle with people of color</a>, and that Black voters especially <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-so-many-black-voters-are-democrats-even-when-they-arent-liberal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prefer more moderate candidates</a>. But the truth lies somewhere in the middle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We looked back at the Squad’s initial primary wins, and found that they’ve often won sizable blocs of nonwhite voters, especially when they have had strong ties to those communities (or at least stronger than their opponent). But at the same time, they haven’t necessarily performed well with all voters of color in their district. In fact, our analysis found that — despite each member’s very different path of Congress — each Squad member’s wins required a multiracial coalition of both white and nonwhite voters. We only found one instance without a clear racial pattern. But even if there is no surefire strategy for progressives to win voters of color, the Squad’s primaries also push back against the idea that progressives consistently struggle with these voters.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="500" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-AOC.png" alt="Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-AOC.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-AOC.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-AOC.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2><strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The first member of the Squad — and arguably still the most famous — is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Few thought the Democratic primary for New York’s 14th Congressional District on June 26, 2018, would be competitive, but Ocasio-Cortez wound up pulling off an upset, defeating then-Rep. Joe Crowley, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, 57 percent to 43 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In seeking to explain the result, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ocasio-cortez-just-did-democrats-a-big-favor/2018/06/27/dafdc498-7a4c-11e8-aeee-4d04c8ac6158_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentators</a> at the time <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/midterms-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-won-in-part-because-of-demographics-and-thats-a-good-thing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed to</a> the district’s changing demographics: Ocasio-Cortez, like 47 percent of the 14th District’s voting-age population, is Hispanic, while Crowley, like only 23 percent of the district’s VAP, is non-Hispanic white.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All demographic data in this article is from the 2020 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> However, this explanation doesn’t tell the whole story as Ocasio-Cortez performed well in both white and Hispanic corners of the district. According to <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean McElwee</a>, the co-founder and executive director of Data for Progress, Ocasio-Cortez “benefited from a situation where very highly engaged liberal people were the big constituency that were turning out.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1356" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/07/01/ocasio-cortez-data-suggests-that-gentrifying-neighborhoods-powered-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-victory-over-the-democratic-establishment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did best in the whiter, more gentrified areas of the 14th District</a> — like the Queens neighborhoods of Astoria, Sunnyside and Woodside. She defeated Crowley 64 percent to 36 percent in precincts with a white VAP of at least 60 percent. She also won heavily (70+ percent) Hispanic precincts, 56 percent to 44 percent. “She had liberals, particularly liberal whites and young whites, and Hispanic voters and that was her successful coalition,” McElwee said. But that isn’t to say that Ocasio-Cortez was able to appeal to all voters of color. The data suggests, and McElwee agreed, that Ocasio-Cortez performed less well with Black voters. Crowley actually won the district’s two Black-majority precincts by a 55 percent to 45 percent margin.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="500" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png" alt="Rashida Tlaib" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2><strong>Rashida Tlaib</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few weeks after Ocasio-Cortez, the second member of the Squad eked out a win in her primary. On Aug. 7, 2018, former state Rep. Rashida Tlaib edged out Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones, another woman of color, in the regularly scheduled Democratic primary for Michigan’s open 13th District, 31 percent to 30 percent.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a concurrent special election to fill the remainder of Rep. John Conyers’s term, and Jones actually won that primary 38 percent to 36 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This was a close, crowded primary — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/michigan-house-district-13-primary-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four other candidates were in the running</a> — but to an even greater extent than Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib won thanks to her strength in precincts with large white populations. She received 42 percent of the vote in the district’s 34 precincts with white VAPs greater than 80 percent. However, this doesn’t show a complete picture: 13 of those precincts were in Dearborn Heights, which has a significant Arab American population, and the U.S. Census Bureau considers Arab Americans to be white. (Tlaib herself is Arab American.) Tlaib won 69 percent of the vote in these 13 precincts versus 26 percent of the vote in the other 21 heavily white precincts, so it’s likely that much of Tlaib’s apparent strength with white voters is in fact due to her base of support in the Arab American community.</p>

But that probably had more to do with Jones’s deep roots in Detroit’s Black community than Black voters explicitly rejecting Tlaib. Having served on the city council since 2006, Jones had fairly high name recognition in the city, and she won 41 percent in those 80+ percent Black precincts (almost all of which are in Detroit).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, given the racial composition of the 13th District’s VAP — 53 percent Black, 35 percent white — Tlaib would have likely lost if the Black vote had not been split among Jones and other candidates. “Rashida did get some support among African Americans, but it wasn’t the lion’s share of her vote,” said <a href="https://clasprofiles.wayne.edu/profile/ad4799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Bledsoe</a>, a professor of political science at Wayne State University and former Michigan state legislator. Instead, Bledsoe said, Tlaib won thanks to her <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/07/16/who-raising-most-money-michigan-congressional-races/788580002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong fundraising</a>, which helped her air broadcast TV ads when no other candidates did, and her appeal to younger, more diverse voters. “There was a more progressive element to Rashida’s campaign,” said Bledsoe. “Brenda is certainly no conservative, but Rashida was talking in a more aggressive way about the progressive agenda and I think that helped mobilize young people.” </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="500" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png" alt="Ilhan Omar" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2><strong>Ilhan Omar</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Squad gained its third member on Aug. 14, 2018, when then-state Rep. Ilhan Omar won the Democratic primary for Minnesota’s open 5th Congressional District with 48 percent of the vote. A big reason for Omar’s success was that, as the first Somali-American state legislator in the U.S., she was already somewhat of a household name, both in the 5th District and around the country. Not only did she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-muslim-woman-also-got-elected-last-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly speak out</a> against then-President Trump, but a year prior to her 2018 congressional election, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2017/09/07/minneapolis-rep-ilhan-omar-featured-on-time-magazine-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she was featured on the cover</a> of Time Magazine. She was also featured in a <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/05/31/ilhan-omar-maroon-5-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music video for Maroon 5</a>, appeared on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7025140/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Daily Show</a> and was the subject of a documentary that premiered at the <a href="https://tribecafilm.com/festival/archive/time-for-ilhan-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tribeca Film Festival</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That national profile proved hard for any of her opponents to cut through. “All of [Omar’s primary opponents] had a hard time making the case against voting for someone who was already an international figure. It was hard to penetrate and no one quite landed on the right message,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/javimorillo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Javier Morillo</a>, a political strategist who works in Democratic politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps unsurprisingly given her name recognition, Omar performed well in all corners of the 5th District. In fact, there was no correlation between a precinct’s racial composition and its level of support for Omar. In precincts whose Black VAPs exceeded 40 percent, Omar received 47 percent of the vote. In precincts where the non-Hispanic white VAP was at least 80 percent, she received 44 percent. Her best precincts spanned Minneapolis’s white-majority University neighborhood, heavily Somali Cedar-Riverside neighborhood and diverse Powderhorn neighborhood.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Omar was also the only member of the Squad to face a competitive primary in 2020. Antone Melton-Meaux, a moderate attorney, mounted a bid against her, and even though both Melton-Meaux and Omar are Black, that race actually broke down much more closely along racial lines. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps contrary to expectations, though, it was the progressive candidate who did better in Black neighborhoods. Omar won the primary overall, 58 percent to 39 percent, but she lost precincts with the highest white VAPs; Melton-Meaux defeated her 55 percent to 43 percent in parts of the district with white VAPs of at least 85 percent. Rather, Omar prevailed thanks to her strong performance in more racially diverse neighborhoods. She did especially well in precincts that were 40 percent Black or more, defeating Melton-Meaux 73 percent to 23 percent.</p>

He also pointed to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/11/its-all-about-benjamins-baby-ilhan-omar-again-accused-anti-semitism-over-tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Israel comments</a> Omar made in 2019 that invoked anti-Semitic tropes as a possible factor. “That was used against her and highlighted in the campaign,” he said. Finally, he noted that media coverage of Omar’s first primary did not focus much on her progressive views, which may have made those moderate voters more willing to vote for her in 2018 than they were in 2020. “​​If she had that reputation she has now … I don’t know how that primary would have played out.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="500" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-PRESSLEY.png" alt="Ayanna Pressley" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-PRESSLEY.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-PRESSLEY.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-PRESSLEY.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2><strong>Ayanna Pressley</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Ayanna Pressley is the fourth original member of the Squad, and she also performed well in all corners of her district, but it was actually Black precincts that gave her, a Black woman, the highest levels of support. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Sept. 4, 2018, Pressley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-ayanna-pressleys-upset-win-in-massachusetts-isnt-really-like-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated then-Rep. Michael Capuano</a>, a white incumbent who had served for nearly 20 years, 59 percent to 41 percent in the Democratic primary for Massachusetts’s 7th District. That 18-point margin is evidence that Pressley held her own everywhere, but she significantly outperformed Capuano, 76 percent to 24 percent, in the district’s 38 majority-Black precincts, mostly located in the Roxbury and Mattapan neighborhoods of Boston.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1354" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Why was Pressley so successful in those areas? She had represented them for nearly nine years on the Boston City Council. And according to <a href="https://mavotertable.org/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth Huang</a>, the executive director of the Massachusetts Voter Table, Pressley’s deep roots in the community went over well with voters of color in general. “She had many validators in communities of color who had known her for a long time,” Huang said. “She also targeted a wider set of voters, including more young people and more people of color in Boston.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But on top of that, Pressley was successful at expanding her appeal to whiter sections of the district, which ultimately elevated her candidacy even further. Per our analysis, she actually edged out Capuano, 51 percent to 49 percent, in the district’s 28 precincts with VAPs that are at least 70 percent white, reflecting her strength with young progressives in areas like <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/09/07/somerville-changing-and-are-its-voters-just-ask-ayanna-pressley/fbwXyuAGpTJIs2yTE93Y3M/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somerville</a> and Allston. But as Huang made clear, Pressley’s win was years in the making. “She was — and is — a very well-known quantity,” Huang said. “She put in the work for 10 years to build a lot of credibility with many different types of voters.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="500" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png" alt="Jamaal Bowman" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2><strong>Jamaal Bowman</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Squad originally consisted of just the four congresswomen mentioned above, but on June 23, 2020, it got a new member: Rep. Jamaal Bowman, who defeated former Rep. Eliot Engel in the Democratic primary for New York’s 16th District, 55 percent to 41 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the 16th District abutting Ocasio-Cortez’s, Bowman prevailed by following Pressley’s template of running up the score in heavily nonwhite neighborhoods. Engel, a white man who had represented the 16th District since 1989, won 51 percent to 45 percent in precincts with VAPs that are at least 70 percent white. But Bowman, a Black man, won 59 percent to 34 percent in Hispanic-majority precincts and 63 percent to 34 percent in Black-majority precincts.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1378" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Bowman didn’t have Pressley’s advantage of already being an elected official in the district, but according to McElwee (who advised Bowman during his campaign), he still had “real ties to civic and other institutions in the Black communities.” As a former school principal, McElwee said, Bowman was able to use his ties to the voters — particularly Black and Hispanic voters — to “upset the normal advantages that incumbents would otherwise have.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another thing that likely helped Bowman’s candidacy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/eliot-engel-new-york.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was a gaffe Engel made</a> after Floyd’s murder and subsequent racial-justice protests, where he essentially said that he only sought press attention on the issue because of his upcoming primary race. Engel’s comment that “if I didn’t have a primary, I wouldn’t care” may have signaled to Black voters especially that he didn’t share their community’s concerns over police brutality.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="500" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BUSH.png" alt="Cori Bush" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BUSH.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BUSH.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BUSH.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2><strong>Cori Bush</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the newest member of the Squad, Rep. Cori Bush, punched her ticket to Congress on Aug. 4, 2020, when she narrowly defeated then-Rep. Lacy Clay, 49 percent to 46 percent, in the Democratic primary for Missouri’s 1st Congressional District. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bush’s path to victory was unusual among Squad members in that she actually <em>lost</em> the parts of her district with the highest concentration of voters who share her racial identity. Bush, who is Black, lost the district’s Black-majority precincts 54 percent to 43 percent. But there is an easy explanation for this: The Clay family had been an institution in St. Louis’s Black community for over 50 years. Clay’s father represented the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Oral-History/Rainey/Representative-Clay-Sr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">district for 32 years</a>, and the younger Clay had served the area in either the state legislature or Congress continuously since 1983.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1372" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In fact, one of the big reasons for the closeness of this race was Clay’s existing ties to older Black voters. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffSmithMO?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Smith</a>, a former Democratic state senator who represented a significant portion of the 1st District, Bush struggled a bit when it came to appealing to these voters since they had become accustomed to supporting the Clay name.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it’s not like Bush didn’t attract <em>any</em> Black support: Her 43 percent performance in Black-majority precincts is actually pretty impressive considering the strength of her opponent. Indeed, Smith said, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/congresswoman-elect-cori-bush-reflects-black-lives-matter/story?id=74760158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bush had strong ties</a> to the Black activist community who wanted to elect a more progressive representative following the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which is part of the 1st District. “Bush’s district is really the epicenter for the modern civil rights racial justice movement post-Ferguson, so that nurtured a cadre of young activists that powered her campaign,” Smith said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Where Bush really excelled, though, was in whiter parts of Missouri’s 1st District. In white-majority precincts, she defeated Clay 54 percent to 38 percent, and she turned in some of her strongest performances in the gentrified neighborhoods of St. Louis like those around Tower Grove Park. And it’s possible the Clay name might have also worked in Bush’s favor in conservative, white enclaves of the city. Smith suggested that some white voters might have voted for Bush as a protest vote against the Clay name. “A longstanding distrust of the Clay machine in some of those places probably helped her even though, ideologically, those wards are closer to him than her.” But Bush’s real base in this primary was white progressives, Smith said. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In sum, the Squad members’ coalitions have been all over the map. While some members (Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Bush) did better in whiter precincts, others (Pressley and Bowman) did better in predominantly nonwhite areas. And in one case (Omar) there was no obvious pattern (at least in her initial election). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even with these differences, though, it’s clear that voters of color aren’t an automatic vote for the establishment-aligned candidate (as Capuano, Engel and Melton-Meaux can attest). Instead, in all the Squad’s primaries, it seems that voters of color opted for the candidate who had a deeper connection to their respective communities. And that shouldn’t be surprising. It makes a lot of sense, actually: Voters vote for the representative who they feel best represents them.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Over the years, many politicians <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-most-candidates-dont-run-again-after-losing-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have embraced this adage</a> when it comes to running for — and, in some cases, eventually winning — higher office, but former Rep. Beto O’Rourke has taken it to another level. On Monday, he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/politics/beto-orourke-governor-texas-2022/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his candidacy for Texas governor in 2022</a>, which will mark the third straight election cycle in which he’s made a bid for major office (he had <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-beto-orourkes-pivot-didnt-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a disappointing run in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary</a> but came close to defeating Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-beto-orourke-could-win-the-2020-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas’s 2018 Senate race</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite O’Rourke’s close finish in 2018, a Democrat still <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2012/sep/26/texas-democrats-have-lost-statewide-elections-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t won a statewide race in Texas since 1994</a>, and given that the national environment seems <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/resist-the-pundits-what-the-2021-elections-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely to favor Republicans in 2022</a>, O’Rourke might face an even more challenging campaign this time around. Still, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is not as popular as he once was, so perhaps we shouldn’t be too quick to write off O’Rourke. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Following his <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/06/greg-abbott-lupe-valdez-dan-patrick-justin-nelson-texas-midterm-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 reelection</a>, Abbott’s job approval rating was clearly net positive (approval rating minus disapproval rating), but recent surveys suggest his standing has worsened to the point that more registered voters in Texas now disapprove of Abbott’s performance than approve.</p>

First, his handling of the pandemic <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/politics/greg-abbott-texas-criticism-coronavirus-handling/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has received a lot of criticism</a> from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/coronavirus-texas-abbott-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all corners in the state</a>, and <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a late September poll</a> from Quinnipiac University found more Texas voters (50 percent) disapproved of his handling of the pandemic than approved (46 percent). Second, Texas voters seem to still be disappointed by his administration’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/19/texas-storm-response-cruz-abbott-perry-470109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">response to the winter storms</a> this past February and the failure of the state’s power grid. Earlier this month, a <a href="https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/f16d5731e331f64ffe563a916d7720c3/ut-tt-2021-11-topline.pdf?_ga=2.135510385.1393670913.1637093857-1094345415.1637093857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey conducted by YouGov</a> on behalf of the University of Texas-Austin and The Texas Tribune found that 60 percent of Texas voters disapproved of how state leaders and the legislature had dealt with the reliability of the grid, which was the highest disapproval mark for any issue asked about in the poll. Finally, Abbott’s numbers may have also suffered in the aftermath of the Texas GOP’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push to essentially ban abortions</a> and to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/16/texas-permitless-carry-gun-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow the concealed carry of handguns without a permit</a> — both being pieces of legislation that Abbott signed into law. A <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/526125317/The-Dallas-Morning-News-University-of-Texas-Tyler-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dallas Morning News/University of Texas-Tyler poll</a> from early September found that 50 percent of registered voters opposed permit-less concealed carry, while the Quinnipiac survey found 53 percent disapproved of Abbott’s handling of abortion.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s no surprise, then, that <a href="https://youtu.be/JnmonAw8niE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the launch video</a> for O’Rourke’s campaign touched on the failure of the electrical grid, as well as Texas’s new abortion and concealed-carry laws. And these issues might be a pathway for O’Rourke to win over independent voters, who are especially displeased with Abbott’s handling of these issues. For instance, the recent UT-Austin/Texas Tribune/YouGov survey <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/greg-abbott-job-approval-trend#independents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found that 57 percent of independents disapproved</a> of Abbott’s performance, and the surveys from Quinnipiac and Dallas Morning News/UT-Tyler found a plurality or majority of independents disapproved of Abbott’s handling of the pandemic, abortion and the concealed-carry law as a whole.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while Texans aren’t thrilled with Abbott’s performance as governor, that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily inclined to prefer O’Rourke. In horse-race polls, Abbott has an early edge over O’Rourke: The UT-Austin/Texas Tribune/YouGov survey found Abbott ahead of O’Rourke by 9 percentage points, while the Dallas Morning News/UT-Tyler poll gave Abbott a 5-point edge back in September. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, a <a href="https://www.txhpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TxHPF-2022gubernatorialelection.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation poll</a> conducted by Rice University in October did find Abbott and O’Rourke running about even among registered voters, and voters also disliked the two equally (47 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of each). At the same time, though, slightly more voters had a favorable opinion of Abbott (49 percent) than O’Rourke (44 percent). And in Quinnipiac’s poll, even though just 42 percent of registered voters said Abbott deserved to be reelected, only 33 percent thought O’Rourke would be a good governor — including just 26 percent of independents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These weaker numbers for O’Rourke underscore some of his potential vulnerabilities as a candidate. Besides being a Democrat in Republican-leaning Texas, O’Rourke has also positioned himself on some issues in ways that <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/15/beto-orourke-texas-governor-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could hurt him in the Lone Star State</a>. Most memorably, in response to a question on gun control <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/09/12/beto-orourke-hell-yes-were-going-take-your-assault-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a September 2019 presidential primary debate</a>, O’Rourke said, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” essentially writing Republican attack ads for them in a state with a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-ownership-by-state-2015-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large number of gun owners</a>. And beyond issues of gun control, Abbott’s campaign <a href="https://twitter.com/AbbottCampaign/status/1460970992164032515?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been only too happy</a> to go after O’Rourke with clips of the Democrat’s past praise for the Green New Deal and opposition to building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. With a massive $55 million <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/08/texas-greg-abbott-fundraising-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his campaign account</a>, Abbott will be able to more than blanket the airwaves, social media and webpages with ads attacking O’Rourke on these points of weakness, too.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly and most fundamentally, the 2022 political environment will probably help Abbott far more than it will aid O’Rourke. When O’Rourke nearly won his 2018 Senate contest, he benefited from very favorable, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic-leaning electoral conditions</a> — namely, there was a Republican president in office <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who was unpopular</a>. This time around, though, the shoe will likely be on the other foot: Republicans will get to run with a Democrat in the White House and, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if current trends continue</a>, an unpopular one at that. And even if President Biden isn’t as unpopular in the fall of 2022 as former President Trump was in the fall of 2018, a midterm environment still tends to disadvantage the party that’s in the White House. This applies to gubernatorial elections, too, even though they are not quite as <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationalized or polarized</a> as federal elections. The president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-very-early-look-at-the-2022-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has lost governorships in 16 of 19 midterm elections</a> since World War II. That means it will be challenging for the president’s party to gain new governorships, especially in states that already lean toward the opposite party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, O’Rourke will be trying to do what he couldn’t do in 2018 or 2020 — win — under arguably even more challenging circumstances. If O’Rourke is going to win higher office someday, it may have to happen sometime <em>after </em>2022 — if he’s willing to keep trying.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A survey conducted in October by Republican pollster Echelon Insights on behalf of the Center for Election Innovation and Research found that Republicans and Trump voters <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/nov-2021-election-integrity-survey/">continued to doubt</a> the legitimacy of the American electoral system. Almost two-thirds said they were not very or not at all confident that the results of the 2020 election were counted accurately, <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/download/29890/">compared with</a> only 7 percent of Democrats and 31 percent of independents. Even more troubling, 53 percent of Republicans and Trump voters lacked confidence that the results would be counted accurately in next year’s midterm elections, compared with 9 percent of Democrats and 27 percent of independents.</li><li>The latest <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/16/post-abc-poll-abortion-supreme-court/">ABC News/The Washington Post poll</a> found that a large majority of Americans wanted the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/">increasingly conservative Supreme Court</a> to embrace the status quo regarding abortion rights. Sixty percent said the Supreme Court should uphold the decision in Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to abortion, compared with just 27 percent who wanted it overturned. And 65 percent said the court should reject the recent law in Texas limiting abortion access to the first six weeks of a pregnancy, while only 29 percent said the law should be upheld.</li><li><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357317/stricter-gun-laws-less-popular.aspx">Gallup found</a> that Americans’ support for stricter gun laws had fallen to its lowest point since 2014. Although 52 percent still backed stricter gun laws, that represents a sizable decrease from the 64 percent who held that position <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/268016/americans-stricter-laws-gun-sales.aspx">in 2019</a>. The drop in support for stricter gun laws since that time is a result from both a slide in Republican support, which was already comparably low, and a decline among independents, whose support fell to 45 percent from 64 percent in 2019.</li><li>Republican Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont is the most popular governor in the country, according to new data <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/18/phil-scott-approval-vermont-polling-senate-race/">released by Morning Consult</a>. Between late July and late October, Scott’s job approval rating was 79 percent among registered voters, 7 points ahead of the next-closest contender, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts. On the other end of the spectrum, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon had a 43 percent approval rating, the lowest of any governor. Despite Scott’s popularity, he has declined interest in running for Vermont’s open Senate seat (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/politics/patrick-leahy-retirement-announcement/index.html">following the retirement</a> of Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy), likely because Vermont remains a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/">very Democratic-leaning state</a> at the federal level.</li><li>American support for the use of the death penalty against convicted murderers is at its lowest point in nearly 50 years, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357440/death-penalty-support-holding-five-decade-low.aspx">according to Gallup</a>. While 54 percent still backed the use of the death penalty in such cases, that figure differs dramatically from the 80 percent who supported its use in 1994. But as with most issues, support for the death penalty shows stark partisan divisions, with 77 percent of Republicans supporting it, compared with 55 percent of independents and 34 percent of Democrats.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Lawmakers in Washington have spent months now negotiating legislation to address climate change and other environmental issues, and it is still <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/11/5/22766086/infrastructure-biden-house-democrats-vote-pass-bbb-spending-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not clear what they will end up doing</a> or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/whats-actually-joe-bidens-new-climate-proposal/620543/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether those actions will be enough</a> given the significant environmental damage that has already been done. Meanwhile, just this year, Americans have experienced a series of extreme weather events that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629621001997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left millions in the cold</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-ida-environment-and-nature-louisiana-storms-hurricanes-9f305dd811e9d8fea248b5e514c9aaf1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">destroyed their homes and battered their communities</a> and <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burned millions of acres of land around them</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this is not an article about Washington’s inaction, polar vortexes, hurricanes, wildfires or any other particular environmental issue. Instead, it is an article about the <em>people</em> who are affected by these issues, and the perceptions and misperceptions Americans have about those people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><hr><span></span></div>
 



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this year, I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-many-americans-dont-see-the-racial-wealth-gap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about</a> how the structure of American society makes it difficult for many people to understand the racial wealth gap that still exists between white and Black America. Many of those same social structures also matter for how Americans experience — and perceive — environmental issues.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start by how we, as a country, experience environmental issues. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Decades of research has found that the <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-environ-082508-094348" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk of exposure to environmental hazards is unequally distributed</a> by race and class in the United States. That is, racial and ethnic minorities and low-income Americans are more likely to live in what environmental sociologist Dorceta Taylor calls “<a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479861781/toxic-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic communities</a>” — places with higher levels of pollution, more hazardous waste sites and toxic facilities — and as a result, they are more likely to experience <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worse health and well-being outcomes</a> than their white and more affluent peers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These differences in exposure to risk are not accidental, either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Numerous scholars from both inside and outside of academia have studied how policy decisions over the previous several decades created these conditions. In one early study conducted in the 1980s, for instance, the U.S. Government Accountability Office<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then known as the General Accounting Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> found that <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/rced-83-168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a disproportionate number of waste sites</a> were placed in African American communities in the South. A few years later, <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1310/ML13109A339.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another study</a> built on the GAO results and found that the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in a community was a large predictor of where commercial hazardous waste facilities were placed around the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By the early 1990s, those initial studies garnered enough attention that the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-02/documents/reducing_risk_com_vol1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began tracking disparities</a>, using metrics such as lead exposure and air pollution exposure. Whether we look at individual studies or at <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/introduction-to-meta-analysis-a-guide-for-the-novice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meta-analyses</a> of multiple studies, the research suggests that environmental disparities are <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429303661-13/environmental-racism-reviewing-evidence-paul-mohai-bunyan-bryant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on racism, income inequality or some combination of both</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But it is not just our experiences with environmental issues that differ by race or socioeconomic status. How different groups of Americans <em>perceive</em> environmental issues also differs by race and class. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419304220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in research that my colleagues and I conducted</a>, we found that while participants largely agreed that “eco-oriented” issues like climate change and drought counted as environmental issues, they differed on whether more “human-oriented” issues like poverty and racism counted as environmental issues, with nonwhite and lower-income participants far more likely to rate those issues as environmental than their white and wealthier counterparts. This reflects how it is often easier for members of groups who regularly experience these risks to make these connections than it is for members of other groups who do not regularly experience poverty, racism or environmental risks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you live in a poor, predominantly minority-serving neighborhood, you may notice that not only are there issues with the <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2017/adrm/carra-wp-2017-05.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">air quality</a> and <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/watered-down-justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water quality</a>, but also there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3590901/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as much green space</a> to get regular exercise. You may also notice that the people around you <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.87.5.730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffer from more health conditions</a>. And seeing these things may lead you to conclude that they are all related — part of a larger, interconnected set of problems. On the other hand, if you live in a rich white neighborhood, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154621000486?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you may not see</a> many (if any) of these problems, and thus you would not know that they are related. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, if you find yourself in that latter group, environmental issues may be more of an abstract political issue for you. Indeed, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027249442100133X?casa_token=FE6V7o3ozuEAAAAA:viamuRqJvwCt2aNdUQWbJMJNIO787u-ggyMqrLvovdHuX414lgnaH-vTvpVqkoJMvu89XgBahw#fig1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent paper</a> examining how the American public has thought about climate change from 2008 through 2019 found that white people were far more likely than people of color to be politically polarized on climate change. For many white Americans, these issues were largely seen as political, but for Americans of color, they were viewed as issues of survival, with people of color far more likely to say that global warming poses a danger to them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That low-income people and people of color are more concerned than white people about environmental issues is important because it points to a glaring disconnect in what most Americans think. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2018, a team of environmental social scientists <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/49/12429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran a study</a> in which they asked Americans how concerned they thought a variety of groups were about environmental issues, in addition to how concerned they were individually. And they found that while most people thought white people, young people and women were the most concerned about the environment, it was actually people of color and poor people who reported the highest levels of environmental concern.</p>

The striking part is that people starkly misperceive — and, specifically, underestimate — the environmental concerns of low-income, Black, Hispanic and Asian Americans. Why? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In part, it is related to the larger structural issues I mentioned before, and to how we <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2021.1971441?journalCode=hpli20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make sense of the world around us</a>. Our position in society either leads us to easily see some issues (like environmental injustices), or it makes those issues much harder to see. In my <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-many-americans-dont-see-the-racial-wealth-gap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous article</a>, I also discussed how the segregated and stratified nature of American society affects things like <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-073018-022707?journalCode=soc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who we’re friends with</a>, which also affects what we learn about. But there are other factors at play here. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One factor is the media we consume. <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/articles/the-racial-divide-on-news-coverage-and-why-representation-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News coverage is also divided along racial lines</a>, and that, in turn, affects the stories that get told. Many editors and producers at mainstream media outlets have white audiences in mind, which <a href="https://prospect.org/culture/i-just-dont-hear-it-voices-of-color-npr-public-radio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shapes the stories</a> they create. And in the environmental realm, there has been the <a href="https://www.wupr.org/2020/01/23/white-washing-in-the-climate-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whitewashing of stories</a> about climate and other environmental movements, which contributes to a perception that it is primarily white people who are concerned about environmental issues. The people who tend to get spotlighted in the environmental movement are also <a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58e3dc309de4bbecc76c4733/1493910385492-4WWYIIU3VQVL4EJQYGZL/image-asset.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealthy white people</a>. Because of that, Americans end up thinking those are the people who care most about the environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It is not just the media, though, that overlooks the contributions of people of color to environmental movements. Environmental organizations are also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/numbers-don-t-lie-green-movement-remains-overwhelmingly-white-report-n1253972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly white</a>. This is true not only in governmental and nongovernmental environmental organizations but also in the environmental sciences, which are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less diverse than many other scientific disciplines</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This lack of diversity has real consequences, too. For instance, research on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378017308671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender in climate change policies</a> has found that men were more likely to positively evaluate climate arguments that were about science and business than about ethics and environmental justice. Consider, though, that it was a failure of ethics and environmental justice that led to something like <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/20/465545378/lead-laced-water-in-flint-a-step-by-step-look-at-the-makings-of-a-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Flint water crisis</a> — a decision-making process that at least one environmental scholar has described as “<a href="https://news.umich.edu/flint-water-crisis-most-egregious-example-of-environmental-injustice-says-u-m-researcher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most egregious example of environmental injustice in recent U.S. history.</a>”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s why the omission of people of color in conversations and research about the environment is such a problem. When we make decisions about who gets to participate in environmental discussions, who gets to participate in environmental research, who gets to be featured in stories about environmental issues and who gets to work at environmental organizations, we are implicitly making decisions about whose lives and futures matter. And we have to remember that those decisions have important implications for what we learn about environmental issues, and for the policies and practices that get developed as a result of that knowledge.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight is seeking an intern to join our politics team for spring 2022. We’re looking for a current student or recent graduate who has experience using data to tell stories about politics — ranging from how Americans feel about an important political issue to unpacking big political and electoral trends.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The intern’s main role will be to report and write stories, but the internship will also involve working closely with the politics team and other parts of the newsroom on a number of collaborative projects. See FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/audio-features/when-women-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“When Women Run” project</a> or our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep dive into police misconduct and settlements</a> for examples of big, cross-newsroom projects that interns have contributed to.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The ideal candidate will have journalism experience and a background in data analysis in addition to some experience covering or analyzing American politics (whether from a journalism class, school paper, job or internship). But “politics” doesn’t just mean electoral politics. It could mean you have experience reporting on policy issues, social movements, polarization in your community or something else. Interpret it broadly because we will too!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Politics Intern will report to the Politics Editor, but as a small newsroom, we’re looking for someone eager to collaborate with colleagues across the newsroom. The Politics Intern is a U.S.-based remote position. Applicants should be able to commit to a full-time schedule from January until May and must be a current student or have graduated in the past 18 months. Apply with a cover letter and resume at the <a href="https://jobs.disneycareers.com/job/united-states/politics-data-reporting-internship-fivethirtyeight-spring-2022-remote/391/19822982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney jobs portal</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Pitch, report and write stories on American politics.</li><li>Conduct original data analysis for stories and bigger features and projects.</li><li>Collaborate with other reporters and teams across the newsroom, including our visual journalists, video journalists and copy desk.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Basic Qualifications</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Journalism experience, whether from a class, working at a student publication or through a job or internship.</li><li>Experience analyzing data — again, experience from a class, student publication or previous job or internship is absolutely fine!</li><li>Some experience reporting on politics.</li><li>Knowledge of FiveThirtyEight and the kinds of journalism we create.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A background in statistics or experience working with R.</li></ul>]]></description>

			<title>Why There Hasn’t Been A Mass Exodus Of Teachers</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This article is a collaboration between FiveThirtyEight and </em><a href="http://fullerproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Fuller Project</em></a><em>, a nonprofit newsroom reporting on issues that affect women.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sarah Caswell is stressed about her job every day. The science and special-education teacher in Philadelphia sees things going wrong everywhere she looks. Her high school students have been falling behind during the COVID-19 pandemic, the students and even the teachers in her school rarely wear masks, and a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-shooting-2021-lincoln-high-school-20211018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shooting just outside her school</a> in October left a bystander dead and a 16-year-old student in the hospital with critical injuries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She’s unhappy. But her solution isn’t to quit — it’s to get more involved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We need to double down,” Caswell said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She isn’t the only one who thinks so. Throughout the past year, surveys and polls have pointed to an oncoming crisis in education: a mass exodus of unhappy K-12 teachers. Surveys from unions and education-research groups have warned that anywhere from <a href="https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/safety-concerns-over-covid-19-driving-some-educators-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-fourth</a> to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-half-of-teachers-considering-leaving-the-classroom-301289190.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half</a> of U.S. educators were considering a career change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Except that doesn’t seem to have happened. The most recent statistics, though still limited, suggest that while some districts are reporting significant faculty shortages, the country overall is not facing a sudden teacher shortage. Any staffing shortages for full-time K-12 teachers appear far less severe and widespread <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/would-you-manage-70-children-and-a-15-ton-vehicle-for-18-an-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than those for support staff like substitute teachers, bus drivers and paraprofessionals</a>, who are paid less and encounter more job instability.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a female-dominated profession, these numbers notably contrast trends showing that <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-relationship-between-school-closures-and-female-labor-force-participation-during-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women in particular</a> have been leaving their jobs at high rates throughout COVID-19. While labor-force participation for women dropped significantly at the start of the pandemic, and <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/September-Jobs-Day.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still remains about 2 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels</a>, teachers by and large seem to be staying at their jobs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, why have the doomsday scenarios not come true? There are many explanations — and the ways they overlap tell us something about the state of American schools, the inner workings of America’s economy and the way gender shapes the American workforce.</p>

A <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1108-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationally representative survey of teachers</a> by RAND Education and Labor in late January and early February found that educators were feeling depressed and burned out from their jobs at higher rates than the general population. These rates were higher for female teachers, with 82 percent reporting frequent job-related stress compared with 66 percent of male teachers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the survey, 1 in 4 teachers — particularly <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/article/why-black-teachers-walk-away" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black teachers</a> — reported that they were considering leaving their jobs at the end of the school year. Only 1 in 6 said the same before the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the data on teacher employment shows a system that is stretched, not shattered. In an <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-bad-are-school-staffing-shortages-what-we-learned-by-asking-administrators/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EdWeek Research Center report</a> released in October, a significant number of district leaders and principals surveyed — a little less than half — said that their district had struggled to hire a sufficient number of full-time teachers. This number paled in comparison, though, with the nearly 80 percent of school leaders who said they were struggling to find substitute teachers, the nearly 70 percent who said they were struggling to find bus drivers and the 55 percent who said they were struggling to find paraprofessionals. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg" alt="A kindergarten teacher preps her classroom" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Yalonda M. James / The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">More concrete jobs data suggests that school employees have largely stayed put. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer public-education professionals quit their jobs between the months of April and August the past two years than did so during that same time immediately before the pandemic. In 2019, around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_10092019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">470,000 public-education employees quit their jobs</a> between April and August compared with around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_10062020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">285,000 in the same period in 2020</a> and around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_10122021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300,000 in 2021</a>. Notably, this data includes both full-time teachers, support staff and higher-education employees, though teachers make up a majority of those included, says Chad Aldeman, policy director of Edunomics Lab, an education-policy research center, at Georgetown University. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Experts point to multiple reasons for this trend. While women have been disproportionately affected by mass COVID-related job losses, teachers haven’t faced the types of widespread layoffs experienced by workers in other professions — including other types of public school employees like bus drivers. Moreover, relative to other types of jobs disproportionately held by women, teachers have more job stability and receive more generous benefits. Educators often get into their work for specifically mission-driven purposes, too, making them uniquely positioned to decide to stay at their jobs, even during particularly stressful periods, experts say. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The early indicators we have show turnover hasn’t spiked this year as we anticipated,” said Aldeman. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, he said, data shows that the hiring crunch might be because there are more jobs to hire for. Vacancies have increased, suggesting that districts might be beefing up hiring after a year of uncertainty and an influx in federal aid. In other words, labor shortages are not totally attributable to increased turnover. And while <a href="https://chicago.chalkbeat.org/2021/9/10/22666840/covid-stress-chicago-public-schools-teachers-stay-put-vacancies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early data</a> on <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/ny-teacher-retirements-pandemic-20210830-7uhkzispm5akxf6mraygjxlclm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teacher retirements</a> suggests that there might have been increases on the margins in some places, fears of mass retirements have not borne out so far. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg" alt="A substitute teacher helps a student during class" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Terry Pierson / The Press-Enterprise via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Still, some local districts are hurting. Sasha Pudelski, the assistant director for policy and advocacy for the School Superintendents Association, has spoken to school leaders around the country who are facing teacher shortages, sometimes at crisis levels. But her sense is that these shortages are uneven depending on a district’s resource level and how well they’re able to pay. Based on what she’s heard from school-district leaders, she suspects shortages are more acute in low-income communities with a lower tax base for teacher salaries, potentially causing a further shortage of educators from underrepresented groups, who disproportionately teach in these areas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, <a href="https://4f730634-e809-4181-92d7-ed1dc705414a.filesusr.com/ugd/1394b9_7709c1ab926247469c2aa9c076b977bc.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fall 2021 study</a> of school-staffing shortages throughout the state of Washington shows that high-poverty districts are facing significantly more staffing challenges than their more affluent counterparts. In some places, there are significant numbers of unfilled positions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Study co-author Dan Goldhaber, who directs the Center for Education Data &amp; Research at the University of Washington and serves as a vice president of the American Institutes for Research, is cautious about drawing conclusions about such an abnormal year. But he believes that fears of teacher shortages in the past have been overblown, pointing to a study by the Wheelock Education Policy Center at Boston University, which found that teacher-turnover rates in Massachusetts remained largely stable throughout the <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwheelockpolicycenter.org%2Feffective-teachers%2Fcovid-19-and-ma-teacher-workforce%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cdgoldhaber%40air.org%7C35aa3baf2e2f468e0ea608d9a1f86aed%7C9ea45dbc7b724abfa77cc770a0a8b962%7C0%7C0%7C637718910633329236%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=a6wr9mYyqpFTXcKn1iBX9JdJ03qD%2FX%2FrIt2cqKNgCq0%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020-21 school year</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I have seen three different waves of people talking about teacher shortages, and I’ve seen policy briefs come out that suggest there are going to be 100,000 to 200,000 slots that can’t be filled for teachers,” said Goldhaber. “Those kinds of dire predictions have never come to pass.”</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather than lean out, a significant number of teachers have become more engaged in workplace issues amid the turbulence. Evan Stone, the co-founder and co-CEO of Educators for Excellence, points to recent union elections in multiple cities that have seen unprecedented turnout. In late September and early October, for example, nearly 16,000 United Teachers Los Angeles members <a href="https://www.utla.net/news/utla-members-approve-agreement-lausd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in a vote over school-reopening issues</a>, while <a href="https://utlaelections.org/results/2020-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 6,000 voted in a 2020 election</a> of union leaders. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the American Federation of Teachers saw a slight increase in membership this year. Randi Weingarten, the union’s president, traveled across the country this fall to get a sense of how her members were feeling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every place I went, yes, there’s trepidation, a lot of agita over the effects of COVID, but there’s a real joy of people being back in school with their kids,” said Weingarten. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, this increase in union participation isn’t across the board. The National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, has lost around 47,000 members, or about 1.6 percent of its membership, since this point last year, according to figures the NEA supplied to FiveThirtyEight and The Fuller Project. The organization attributes most of the losses to a decline in hiring at the higher-education level and decreased employment for public K-12 support staff.</p>

(A spokesperson for Philadelphia public schools notes that the district has an indoor mask mandate that all individuals are expected to follow.) For a single mother supporting three kids, quitting isn’t an option. Caswell can’t imagine switching schools within the same district either, even though she describes her work environment as miserable. Her students, some of whom she’s worked with for years, mean too much to her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, Caswell has started working to organize members in her school to represent their interests on a larger level and effect change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I can’t just walk out, though there’s definitely moments where I would have liked to,” said Caswell. “We’re tired. The demands keep coming, and we can’t do it all.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">She sees her advocacy as directly related to her gender, believing the profession receives less support and resources than it deserves because the composition of the workforce is largely female. Indeed, union representation, and the perks that come along with it, is something that other sectors facing massive shortages of female workers, like service and hospitality industries, don’t necessarily receive. As of 2017, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/participation-in-teachers-unions-is-down-and-likely-to-tumble-further/2017/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 70</a> percent of teachers participated in a union or professional association, according to federal data. By comparison, the same is true for only about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/health/covid-health-workers-unions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 percent of nurses</a>, another predominantly female workforce. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Female professions are undervalued by society, and I think that’s part of the reason teachers are <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t03.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more densely organized</a> than almost any other worker in America right now,” said Weingarten. </p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, plenty of teachers are quitting — and they’re quitting at least in part because of the pandemic. According to a survey by the RAND Corporation, almost half of former public school teachers who left the field since March 2020 cited <a href="https://www.rand.org/news/press/2021/02/22.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 as the driving factor</a>. The pandemic exacerbated already-stressful working conditions, forcing teachers to work longer hours and navigate a challenging transition to remote learning. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For some teachers, the decision to quit was easy. High school science educator Sara Mielke, who had recently returned to teaching after taking time off to stay home with children, quit her job several weeks into this school year over the lack of COVID-safety protocols in her Pflugerville, Texas, school. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I felt like I couldn’t trust these people to prioritize safety in general,” said Mielke, who adds that she was chastised by school administrators for showing her students accurate information about vaccine effectiveness and enforcing the school’s mandatory mask policy. (The district did not respond to a request for comment.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other teachers say that while they wanted to leave, the prospect of saying goodbye to their students was too much. So, they decided to stay and push for changes.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="709" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg" alt="Students hold signs during a drive by parade for Teacher Appreciation Week" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Jessica Rinaldi / The Boston Globe via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That was part of the calculation for Kiffany Cody, a special-education teacher in Gwinnett County, Georgia. She took a stress-related medical leave of absence last year, in part because she felt her district was neglecting worker safety. But Cody returned to the classroom after several months, noting she is “really, really, really passionate about the kids.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year she’s banded together with other educators to speak out about unsafe working conditions and start tracking violations of district safety protocols. They’ve become close friends, a support group who feel determined to hold their district accountable and make schools kinder and safer for students and staff. (A representative from Gwinnett County schools said that the “district follows the CDC recommendations for schools regarding layered mitigation strategies, isolation, and quarantine guidelines to promote a healthy and safe environment for our students, staff, and visitors.”)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Every now and then, Cody looks at LinkedIn and ponders working in another field. But for now, she’s in it for the long haul — for her students. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re trying to work within the system to do what we can to help the students,” said Cody. “We can leave and find jobs in other districts and industries, but at the end of the day, the kids can’t go anywhere.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Facebook’s algorithm<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s platform runs on a system of many algorithms that all have different functions and interact with one another. This system is colloquially referred to as “the algorithm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> is its superpower — and its kryptonite. Yes, it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/10/tech/facebook-whistleblower-algorithms-fix/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads to higher engagement</a> that earns the company <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-reports-9-billion-profit-day-documents-highlight-internal-ang-rcna3757" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions of dollars</a>, but it’s also tied to some of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/17/facebook-cambridge-analytica-kogan-data-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company’s biggest scandals</a>. Last month, when the Facebook Papers — a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/explainer-facebook-papers-80766584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trove of leaked corporate documents</a> provided to reporters and Congress — were released, a mountain of news coverage blamed the algorithm for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the spread of misinformation</a> and divisive content, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radicalizing users</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-23/how-facebook-s-algorithm-led-a-new-india-user-to-fake-news-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failing to protect them</a> from some of the most graphic content on the site.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the algorithm is to blame, can Facebook change the algorithm to make it better? What would that look like? To find out, I interviewed 12 leading experts on data and computer science, as well as former Facebook employees, and asked them to propose changes that could help the algorithm suck less. What I got was a range of ideas about how Facebook could start to solve this problem, or whether a solution is even possible. Some are more radical than others, so I’ve categorized these ideas from mild to spicy<strong> </strong>(though we know Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/style/mark-zuckerberg-meta-jokes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prefers it sweet</a>). </p>



<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> <strong>Mild takes:</strong> <strong>Limiting shares and more user controls</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many experts pointed out that, along with identifying some of the problems with the algorithm, the Facebook Papers also included a number of possible solutions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Some of the internal research found shockingly simple tweaks [to improve the algorithm],” said Noah Giansiracusa, a mathematics professor at Bentley University and author of “How Algorithms Create and Prevent Fake News.” “For example, if you limit the number of reshares, that will actually reduce the amount of disinformation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Resharing is a crucial way that Facebook gets engaging content into users’ newsfeeds. It allows content to travel through Facebook networks to get in front of users who wouldn’t otherwise see it, and it’s how you wind up with viral content, <a href="https://time.com/3117501/als-ice-bucket-challenge-videos-on-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for better</a> or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/21/1030038616/facebooks-most-viewed-article-in-early-2021-raised-doubt-about-covid-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for worse</a>. Many of the experts I spoke to mentioned creating “friction” or “speed bumps” to slow down bad content — like disinformation, hate speech or extreme content — before it goes viral. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/22/1048543513/facebook-groups-jan-6-insurrection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internal research at Facebook</a> found that limiting “deep reshares” (where content is reshared not only by the original poster’s network of friends or followers, but also their friends’ friends, and their friends’ friends’ friends, and so on) of political content could reduce misinformation shared via external links by 25 percent and reduce misinformation found in images (think misleading memes) by half. Facebook implemented these changes, but only temporarily. The site <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/05/inside-feed-reduce-remove-inform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does moderate misleading content</a> by removing it if it violates the site’s community standards, and downranking content that the algorithm deems likely to be harmful, but the experts I spoke to still felt there was a gap where harmful content is slipping through.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow and the director of the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative at the German Marshall Fund, suggested Facebook adopt a kind of “circuit breaker,” where the share button is automatically but temporarily removed on content that starts getting deep reshares very quickly, until the content can be evaluated. Something like this, Kornbluh noted, could have stopped the disinformation video “Plandemic” (which falsely cast doubts on the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the safety of vaccines) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/technology/plandemic-movie-youtube-facebook-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from getting millions of views</a> before it was ultimately removed from the site. Katie Harbath, the former public policy director at Facebook, noted that WhatsApp (which is owned by Facebook’s parent company, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/facebook-announces-changing-company-meta/story?id=80683908" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a>) was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/whatsapps-new-limit-cuts-virality-of-highly-forwarded-messages-by-70/#:~:text=In%20one%20of%20the%20biggest,billion%20users%20on%20April%207." target="_blank" rel="noopener">able to cut the virality of similar kinds</a> of “deep reshared” content by limiting how many contacts a user could forward a message to at one time, and said similar limits on sharing could be helpful at Facebook. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The algorithm could also identify “bad actors” who have repeatedly shared misleading content and demote all of their future posts, said Nathaniel Persily, co-director of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center. “They should always be demoted in the newsfeed, regardless if they’re talking about baseball or QAnon,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Multiple experts also pointed to more prominent user controls, to allow users to decide what content they’d like to see. While Facebook does offer quite a lot of user control options, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/10/21/170668/algorithm-awareness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies have shown</a> most users are unaware of how they work, and there’s not an intuitive way for users to signal dissatisfaction with content, said Karrie Karahalios, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has studied user experience with Facebook. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roddy Lindsay, a former Facebook data scientist who went on to co-found a startup, wants the algorithm to prioritize content that users are likely to deem “good for the world.” It’s an admittedly subjective metric, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook experimented with it</a> by having users rate content on whether they felt it was “good” or “bad” for the world. It then used that feedback to train the algorithm to prioritize only the “good” stuff. Facebook researchers found this reduced the amount of negative content in users’ feeds, but it also reduced the number of times users logged onto Facebook, so a watered-down version of it was ultimately adopted instead. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not that these algorithms can’t be improved,” Lindsay said. “The problem is that the only decision makers for what these algorithms optimize for are the companies.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We know from the Facebook Papers that some of these recommendations were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/the-facebook-papers-covid-vaccine-misinformation-c8bbc569be7cc2ca583dadb4236a0613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented slowly</a> or for a limited period of time, while others were, at least at the time, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-papers-badge-posts-former-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected</a>. It’s unclear which, if any, of the recommendations from the papers have since been implemented at Facebook — Mari Melguizo, a spokesperson for the platform, pointed to the site’s recently published “<a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/features/approach-to-ranking/types-of-content-we-demote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content distribution guidelines</a>,” which list the kind of content that’s demoted on the site, including spam and clickbait. “These working documents from years ago show our efforts to understand these issues and don’t reflect the product and policy solutions we’ve implemented since,” Melguizo said.</p>



<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> <strong>Medium takes:</strong> <strong>More boring feeds</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some experts felt Facebook’s algorithm needed a more substantial overhaul to tackle its worst byproducts, including changes that might make Facebook slightly less fun for users. Laura Edelson, a computer science Ph.D. candidate at New York University who <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22612151/laura-edelson-facebook-nyu-ad-observatory-social-media-researcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies disinformation and political advertising on social media</a>, said one thing revealed in the Facebook Papers was the algorithm’s prioritization of something called “downstream meaningful social interactions.” (Which is also how I describe my Friday nights.) In a nutshell, imagine two pieces of content: Post A is something you, the Facebook user, are highly likely to engage with, but nobody else in your network is. Post B is something you’re less likely to engage with, but many people in your network are. By prioritizing downstream MSI, the algorithm is more likely to show you post B, even though it might be less relevant to you. That might expose you to more polarizing or extreme content than you would like to see. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internal research at Facebook showed</a> that reducing how much the algorithm considered this metric when it came to posts about civic (i.e., political) and health information helped reduce the spread of misinformation, and <a href="https://twitter.com/davegillis/status/1446371819531890689" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook did implement</a> the changes for those categories (and is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently experimenting</a> with further reducing how much the algorithm considers the potential for comments and shares on political content), but Edelson argued those changes should be made for all content on the site. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Facebook is not perfect at detecting these categories — far from it — and they’re particularly bad at the beginning of a piece of content’s life,” Edelson said. “That means it’s entirely possible that it won’t detect that civic content is civic until after it’s already gone viral.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jinyan Zang, a researcher at the Public Interest Tech Lab at Harvard University, said one thing Facebook could do is shift the balance of what it deems valuable. Rather than focusing on quantitative metrics like clicks and reshares, the algorithm could prioritize qualitative metrics (like how positive or relevant a post might be to a user). You might be more likely to engage with your cousin’s college boyfriend’s post about a conspiracy theory, but you might <em>prefer</em> to see a photo of your neighbor’s kids’ Halloween costumes. Facebook’s algorithm takes a lot of factors into account when ranking content, including more qualitative measures, so there’s no reason it couldn’t crank up that dial. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another more dramatic change would be eliminating the ranking algorithm for the newsfeed altogether, and returning to a reverse-chronological feed. In other words, just show everybody everything people posted, rather than trying to personalize the feed just for you (and whatever the algorithm thinks you’re most likely to click, or rage-click). This notion is controversial. Some of the experts I spoke to said it would never work because it incentivizes quantity over quality — a fast road to spam — while also making it less likely that you’ll see anything relevant, interesting or engaging (in every sense of the word) on your feed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But proponents of this idea (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-05/could-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-bring-back-time-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Facebook whistleblower</a> Frances Haugen) say the downsides to reverting to a reverse chronological feed may be outweighed by the benefits. A reverse chronological feed would, by definition, favor content from users who post frequently, so your newsfeed could easily get clogged with posts from a particularly active group you’re in, or memes from a particularly bored acquaintance you forgot you friended. “You would be exposed to things that are more mundane, but that content plays an important role — we’re not all having the best day ever,” Lindsay, the former Facebook data scientist, said. “People say it’s boring or noisy or has content from random pages, and my response to that is, ‘Yes, of course, but that’s where user controls come in.’” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the furthest end of the take Scoville scale are two ideas, one optimistic and the other pessimistic: </p>



<ol><li>Facebook can completely revamp its astronomically successful and profitable business plan</li><li>Facebook is irredeemable, and should be forced to fail </li></ol><p data-paragraph="main">Jeff Allen and Sahar Massachi are both former Facebook employees who worked on integrity teams (the groups tasked with finding ways to deal with all of the worst bits of Facebook, like disinformation and extremism). They said that as long as Facebook’s mission (“to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”) and metrics (user engagement) are at odds, there’s no amount of algorithmic tweaks that will solve its problems. Instead, Facebook needs to use different metrics that align with its stated values to measure its success. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you’re counting harmful content towards your success, you’re just setting yourself up for internal conflict,” Allen said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some experts felt that the blue sky version of Facebook realigning its metrics with its values simply wouldn’t work. I asked each of the interviewees what they would do if I waved a magic wand and gave them total control over Facebook. “I would turn off Facebook and apologize to the people of the world,” said Cathy O’Neil, a data scientist and algorithmic auditor. “They can’t actually solve their problems.” </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/government-regulate-facebook-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80528845</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">O’Neil argued that as long as Facebook is a for-profit company that earns revenue through ads, it will only ever be able to play catchup with negative content, and that any external pressures like regulation that would actually be effective would only end up making Facebook so unprofitable that the business would collapse. Imran Ahmed, the founding CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, made a similar argument, noting that asking Facebook to make changes to an algorithm that — from a business perspective — works quite effectively is “the axiom of insanity.” Instead, he called for regulations that would create costs to Facebook for the harm its product creates as an incentive for change.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The cost of the harms created by Facebook are not in any way internal to Facebook. Users pay the price and society pays the price,” Ahmed said. “Impunity leads to terrible things, and we’re seeing an experiment in impunity now. “</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the experts I spoke to almost unanimously called for regulation. Blue sky ideas are great, but we’ve been trusting Facebook to get better for 15 years, and it’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguably worse</a> than it’s ever been. It might be time to put some limits on its superpower, and its supreme power.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Following the elections in New Jersey and Virginia, Patrick Murray, the director of the New Jersey-based Monmouth University Polling Institute, wrote an article titled “<a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/11/pollster-i-blew-it-maybe-its-time-to-get-rid-of-election-polls-opinion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘I Blew It.’ Maybe It’s Time To Get Rid Of Election Polls</a>.” Essentially he said that the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/monmouth-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A-rated Monmouth Poll</a> was significantly off in the New Jersey governor’s race and had been off in other recent elections. As a result, he suggested that perhaps pollsters should stop doing election polling altogether and just stick to issue polling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Murray tells us why he came to that conclusion and what a world without horse-race polling might look like. Later in the podcast, <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/rogoff/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenneth Rogoff</a>, a Harvard professor and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, joins to discuss the causes of the recent high levels of inflation and how this is shaping Americans’ perspectives of the economy.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In a normal election year, Richard Leonardon, 60, would be supporting a Republican or independent political candidate. But during at least one race in his lifetime, Leonardon broke his habit. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was 1996, when he was living in Pennsylvania’s 14th District, long represented by William Coyne, a Democrat. The Republican candidate, Bill Ravotti, didn’t really stand a chance of defeating Coyne, but Leonardon still couldn’t bring himself to vote for Ravotti. Instead, Leonardon wrote his own name on the ballot.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That year, the only other candidate on the ballot was Paul Scherrer of the Socialist Equality Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> That’s because, as a gay man, Leonardon found certain <a href="http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19981024debate5.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments Ravotti made about gays and lesbians</a> unsettling. Leonardon stressed that “someone does not have to be very ‘pro-gay’ to get my vote.” He just doesn’t want politicians to espouse openly anti-gay views, adding that his policy when assessing political candidates is generally “I won’t discuss it if you won’t discuss it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the fact that Leonardon voted for a Republican even once — and has continued to support Republican or independent candidates — is notable because most lesbian, gay and bisexual voters tend to identify as Democrats.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight did not look at transgender Americans’ political beliefs for this story. Polling data for this segment of the electorate is sparse; plus, whether someone is transgender is separate from their sexual orientation. We also were not able to look at the political beliefs of Americans who identify as queer because of a lack of polling data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> Lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans still represent a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/329708/lgbt-identification-rises-latest-estimate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small share of the adult population</a> (about 5 percent), but a 2016 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/25/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-voters-remain-a-solidly-democratic-bloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a> study found that 82 percent of LGB voters identified as or leaned Democratic while only 18 percent identified as or leaned toward the GOP. Moreover, LGB voters were much more likely than the electorate overall to hold broadly liberal political beliefs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there’s still a small but growing number of LGB voters who are loyal to the GOP. This is true for many reasons, but one of the biggest threads I stumbled upon in my interviews and research is that many LGB Republicans see their sexuality and politics as separate. They’re also more likely to factor normal GOP dogma — favoring lower taxes, less federal government intervention and some restrictions on abortion — into their identity. On top of that, most believe that the party <em>has</em> changed a lot in its treatment of same-sex couples. During his presidential campaign in 2016, for example, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-who-cast-himself-as-pro-lgbt-now-under-fire-from-democrats-for-rolling-back-protections/2019/05/30/95c04e96-8306-11e9-95a9-e2c830afe24f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made overt appeals</a> to LGBTQ voters, and ahead of the 2020 election, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/us/politics/trump-lgbtq-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced an LGBTQ coalition</a>, with Richard Grenell, the openly gay U.S. ambassador to Germany at the time, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/26/grenell-to-join-trump-campaign-283026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigning on Trump’s behalf</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More generally speaking, Republican voters also seem to have changed their attitude toward issues like same-sex marriage. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Gallup</a>, which has been tracking Americans’ support for marriage equality since 1996, a record-high 70 percent of all adults now believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by the law and that same-sex couples should have the same rights as opposite-sex couples who are married. And for the first time ever, a majority of Republicans (55 percent) also say they support same-sex marriage. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="816" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Historically, though, many LGB voters have tended to lean Democratic because the Republican Party has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/16/republicans-gay-marriage-wars-505041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively campaigned against LGB rights</a> and, in some cases, the LGBTQ community itself. In 2003, then-Sen. Rick Santorum, who would go on to run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016, notoriously <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/politics/rick-santorum-homosexuality-comments-same-sex-marriage/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likened homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality</a>, and in his 2004 reelection bid, then-President George W. Bush called for a constitutional amendment to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/05/same.sex.marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban same-sex marriage</a>, something he proposed again in 2006. These examples aren’t some relic of how the GOP used to operate either. In October, just before he was elected governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin said he <a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/11/glenn-youngkin-virginia-marriage-equality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was personally opposed to same-sex marriage</a>. And even Trump, for all his courting of LGBTQ voters, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/07/politics/justice-department-colorado-cake/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sided with the Colorado baker</a> who argued in a 2018 Supreme Court case that his religious beliefs were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jun/04/gay-cake-ruling-supreme-court-same-sex-wedding-colorado-baker-decision-latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">justification for not making wedding cakes</a> for same-sex couples. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://turnbulldugarte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stuart Turnbull-Dugarte</a>, a political science professor at the University of Southampton who has done research on how sexual identity affects vote choice,<strong> </strong>noted that this not-so-distant history is one big reason why there’s a strong correlation between identifying as LGB and voting Democratic. “The Democrats, while being slow on endorsing [same-sex marriage] pre-Obama, have always been the more pro-LGB of the two parties, and LGB voters have rewarded these pro-LGB stances by awarding Democratic candidates with their votes on polling day,” he told me. Turnbull-Dugarte added that even in cases where Democrats are somewhat lukewarm on issues related to LGBTQ rights, they’re still often more open compared with Republicans. “Between a silent Democrat and an anti-gay Republican, LGBs know which candidate is going to improve — or at least not damage — their welfare.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, there are signs that the GOP is making inroads with this bloc: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/25/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-voters-remain-a-solidly-democratic-bloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Pew</a>, which used exit polling data, 22 percent of LGB voters backed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, while 24 percent backed Republican candidates during the 2014 midterm elections. Some estimates also suggest that Trump won as much as 27 percent of the LGBT vote in 2020 — which, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/01/had-lgbt-voters-stayed-home-trump-might-have-won-2020-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if true, would be the highest share of support</a> any Republican presidential nominee has ever received from this group.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think I’m accepted in the Republican Party. A lot of Republicans don’t like gays, but they say, ‘What you do is your own business,’” Leonardon said. “I don’t feel the Republican Party has an anti-gay bias nearly as much as it used to, particularly because the older Republicans have died off and the ones 50 and under just don’t care as much.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that younger Republicans are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-some-socially-liberal-gen-z-voters-arent-leaving-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close to their Democratic peers</a> in supporting LGBTQ rights. But there’s still a tension some LGB Republicans must grapple with when navigating their political identity: While the GOP writ large has gradually <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">softened its stance</a> on same-sex marriage, the six people I spoke with still have to square existing within a party where <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/06/27/there-is-now-a-dramatic-generational-divide-over-white-evangelical-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some prominent voting blocs like white evangelical Christians still don’t <em>fully </em>embrace</a> the sexual orientation of LGB Americans — and where party leaders sometimes still espouse <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/06/09/metro/republican-who-made-anti-gay-remarks-says-she-wont-be-bullied-into-resigning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homophobic sentiments</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, a few people told me that it’s hard for them to feel accepted within larger LGBTQ communities due to their political beliefs. But, for the most part, how much they feel the need to address that tension runs in tandem with how central being lesbian, gay or bisexual is in their life.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Being a gay conservative, you always find yourself hiding one part of yourself from another and switching in between these two communities and never being able to find that balance,” said E.A., a 24-year-old in Washington, D.C., who asked to be identified by his initials out of fear of retribution for his beliefs and sexual orientation. “I can’t speak for other people, but for my friends and I, this is something we commonly run into.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">E.A. isn’t alone on this. Several people I spoke to said it’s easier to be lesbian, gay or bisexual in Republican circles than a Republican in LGBTQ+ circles. That may have to do with one of the biggest differences between LGB Republicans and LGB Democrats: that most LGB Republicans see their sexuality as separate from — or secondary to — their political identity. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to an October 2020 study from the <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgb-party-affiliation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law</a>, 54 percent of LGB Republicans said their sexual orientation was an insignificant<em> </em>part of who they are compared with 38 percent of LGB Democrats who felt the same. Conversely, 85 percent of LGB Democrats said that being LGB was a “very important” aspect of themselves versus 68 percent of LGB Republicans.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1292" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“While most LGBs are strong Democrats, the minority who do ‘break ranks’ with the group tend to have a lower sense of identification with the LGB identity,” said Turnbull-Dugarte. “These are likely to be people who, whilst they may have a same-sex partner, might not necessarily be participants in gay culture or be fans of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Leonardon told me he fell into this bucket. “My sexual orientation being gay is just a tiny part of me and doesn’t really affect where I stand politically,” he said. “I think the Democratic Party tends to pander too much to various groups, and I think we should look at people more as individuals than as part of a group.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">E.A. agreed. “I don’t see someone’s sexuality as a defining factor of one’s character or personality. I see my sexuality as a part of me, as I would see my arm or any other facet that creates who I am. It doesn’t define whether I lean more left or right,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another important distinction, Turnbull-Dugarte noted, is that LGB Republican voters are far less likely to view society as being biased or discriminatory toward the LGBTQ+ population. “In other words, they do not share the claims of the LGBTQ+ ‘collective’ as being a group subjected to systematic marginalization,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s true that in my interviews, many said they didn’t think Republicans were actively vilifying them anymore. Moreover, some said that the party simply didn’t talk about same-sex marriage as much as it used to. “I feel like gay rights isn’t an issue now since it’s pretty much settled,” said Nestor Moto Jr., a 26-year-old gay Republican living in California. “The court has already decided.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that doesn’t mean being in the GOP still isn’t without difficulties. Some of the people I spoke with felt as if they had to hide or suppress parts of their identity because they worried about being alienated either due to their sexuality or their politics. This is something the Williams Institute study suggested was a <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgb-party-affiliation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common sentiment shared among</a> LGB Republicans versus LGB Democrats. Per its research, 46 percent of LGB Republicans (compared with 72 percent of LGB Democrats) said they felt like a part of the LGBT community. Meanwhile, only 45 percent of LGB Republicans (and 70 percent of LGB Democrats) said they felt a bond with the LGB community. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I spoke to Alex P., a 32-year-old bisexual man living in California who does not want his last name used due to privacy concerns. He told me he’s happily married to a woman with whom he’s open about his struggles, but beyond that, only a few close friends and family members know about his sexual orientation. He added, however, that due to his religion and political beliefs, he’s never acted as he says “outwardly gay”  — even though he’s been inclined to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I didn’t really come to terms with my bisexuality until I was in my mid-20s, but I’m also a Christian and I believe the Bible is authoritative,” he said. “My personal preferences are secondary to that.” He added, however, that he thinks some conservatives “are not compassionate” toward people who are not heterosexual. “One of the errors conservatives make is they assume because one is LGBT, that makes one a liberal or someone who doesn’t care about the morality of their sexual behavior. My hope is that society would understand that LGBT people are not a uniform bloc and that some do not view their sexuality as their primary identity.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/gay-men-republican-81140535</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">E.A., meanwhile, said he’s run into issues explaining his politics and sexuality with people on dating apps, in particular. “There’s been a number of times where I’ve interacted with people and the first question is, ‘Well, you’re not a Republican, right?’” he told me. “On Hinge, if you have ‘moderate’ in your profile, it means you’re conservative. There’s small, nuanced things one always has to navigate as a gay Republican, and I don’t think straight Republicans or gay Democrats have to worry about that.” Moto said he’s run into similar issues: “It’s easier to tell Republicans that I’m gay than to tell gay people I’m a Trump supporter. I lost a couple friends back [in 2016] and people were very hostile; that’s one reason I got out of politics because I didn’t want people to continue to harass me.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But of the LGB Republicans I spoke with, none seemed to hold any deep-seated resentment toward the GOP over negative interactions they’ve had regarding their sexuality. In fact, they all seemed to really agree with the party’s message, and many said they also thought that Democrats had gone too far left in recent years. Leonardon, for example, told me he’s been loyal to Republican or independent candidates because he prioritizes other issues — “tax issues, government-regulation issues [and] free-speech issues.” Meanwhile, Barb Hauxwell, a 61-year-old lesbian from Oklahoma, said she’s firmly pro-Trump and would never go back to voting for Democrats (which she did before she and her sister took over her family’s business). “I’m fiscally conservative. I’m still a Christian — it doesn’t matter whether I’m gay or not. I’m against abortion,” she said. “Pretty much everything the conservative party is for, I’m with them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, LGB Republicans make up a small slice of the LGBTQ+ community and an even smaller slice of the electorate, but for now at least, the Republican platform seemed to hold more weight for them than any negativity and vilification they might experience because of their sexuality. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hauxwell put it bluntly: “Sex is only a small part of our lives, and now that I’m older, I don’t even have it, so it doesn’t matter.”</p>]]></description>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">You can see it at the grocery store, the gas station and your heating bill (though, mercifully, <a href="https://qz.com/2087483/alcohol-and-air-travel-resisted-high-us-inflation-in-october-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not at the liquor store</a>): Prices are getting higher. Since October of last year, prices for consumer goods have risen 6.2 percent — the biggest year-over-year increase since 1990 — according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report released Wednesday</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices are on the rise in nearly every category, including gas, food and housing, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/how-the-supply-chain-caused-current-inflation-and-why-it-might-be-here-to-stay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely as a result</a> of supply chain disruption, labor shortages and lingering effects of the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/11/10/22775092/inflation-cpi-october-economy-biden-fed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mix</a> of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/10/economy/consumer-price-inflation-october/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coverage</a> in the media, the prevailing message from officials seems to be “don’t panic.” The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/with-bond-buying-taper-bag-fed-turns-wary-eye-inflation-2021-11-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicts this period</a> of rising prices to be “transitory,” and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/10/1054019175/inflation-surges-to-its-highest-since-1990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are signs</a> that price increases are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/inflation-may-cool-off-in-november-and-december-shipping-data-suggests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting to slow</a>. But in the meantime, Americans are worried about inflation, and most blame the Biden administration, according to recent polls. It’s why Biden <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-11-10/biden-says-addressing-rising-inflation-is-a-priority-for-his-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched gears this week</a>, going from celebrating the passage of his bipartisan infrastructure bill to addressing inflation concerns. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you haven’t noticed prices going up, you’re in the minority. Seventy-six percent of U.S. adults said gas prices had gone up “a lot,” and 65 percent said food prices had gone up “a lot,” according to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/87gqotkd1s/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted Nov. 6-9. One in four Americans said they spent more on groceries in October, compared with September, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/grocery-holiday-budget-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Oct. 29 through Nov. 3. And <a href="https://scottrasmussen.com/77-have-recently-experienced-sharp-price-increases-while-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Scott Rasmussen national survey</a> conducted Oct. 11-13 found that 77 percent of registered voters had “recently experienced sharp increases in the cost of items they would like to buy.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are also anticipating prices to continue to rise, especially as we head into the holiday season. In <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/expected-price-hikes-food-travel-tech-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a different Morning Consult poll</a>, which was conducted Oct. 29 through Nov. 1, a majority of Americans anticipated prices for consumer tech, food, travel, toys and jewelry would be higher this year than in previous years, and planned to compensate for the increase by hunting for deals. As the holidays approach, consumers have been most concerned about the cost of meat, produce and dairy, according to the <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/grocery-holiday-budget-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Morning Consult poll</a>. Forty-eight percent of Americans were “very concerned” about the cost of meat, 37 percent about produce and 33 percent about dairy. A plurality of consumers (46 percent) said they “often” compared prices to reduce their grocery costs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are not happy about these price increases. In a <a href="https://civiqs.com/documents/Civiqs_DailyKos_monthly_banner_book_2021_10_h82c93.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Kos/Civiqs poll</a> conducted Oct. 30 through Nov. 2, 78 percent of registered voters said they were dissatisfied with the price of gas (only 5 percent said they were satisfied) and 75 percent said they were dissatisfied with the price of consumer goods like food, clothing and household items. This dissatisfaction about the price of consumer goods was highest among Republicans, at 92 percent, compared with 57 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of independents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are feeling the price increases in their pocketbooks. That Economist/YouGov poll found 56 percent of Americans said it was at least somewhat difficult to afford gas, with 55 percent saying the same about food and 48 percent saying the same about housing costs. <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-16-19_Complete_National_Topline_October-21-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Fox News poll</a> conducted Oct. 16-19 showed concern about inflation was higher than it’d been for the past four months, with 87 percent of registered voters saying they were “very” or “extremely” concerned about inflation and higher prices.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Increased prices can <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/05/1024139056/inflation-is-a-big-political-test-for-president-bidens-economic-agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact voters’ political views</a> of the economy overall because their effects are felt so immediately, contributing to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?ex_cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s negative approval rating</a>. “There is a psychology to inflation that is different from everything else, and it tends to drive how people view the economy because they experience it every day whether it is at the grocery store, gas pump or buying household goods,” John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-11-10/biden-says-addressing-rising-inflation-is-a-priority-for-his-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Los Angeles Times</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polling captures how voters are thinking about inflation as a political issue. A plurality of registered voters (40 percent) said the Biden administration’s policies were “very responsible” for the inflation, and a majority (62 percent) said the administration’s policies were at least “somewhat responsible,” <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/20054637/2110084_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Oct. 16-18. In a <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HHP_October2021_Topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard/Harris poll</a> conducted Oct. 27-28, 56 percent of registered voters said they weren’t confident in the Biden administration’s ability to keep inflation at bay, and 53 percent said the same about the Federal Reserve’s ability. A majority (56 percent) said that Congress passing a $1.5 to $2 trillion social spending bill (such as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-repeats-worries-about-inflation-amid-final-social-spending-bill-n1283670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the one they’re currently trying to pass</a>) would lead to more inflation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the public reaction is out of step with expert forecasts, their fears should not be brushed aside. Some economists theorize that, left unchecked, fears about inflation can make the situation worse <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/inflation-expectations-and-what-it-could-mean-for-markets-bmo-capital.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by creating a self-fulfilling prophecy</a> in which employees, afraid of rising prices, demand higher wages, the costs of which employers would then cover through raising prices, leading to higher inflation. This is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22576069/inflation-1970s-volcker-powell-federal-reserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what happened in the 1970s</a>, and it led to nearly double-digit inflation rates. Regardless of how transitory the Fed thinks these price increases will be, Americans are worried right now.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The 2022 midterm elections are a little less than a year away, and an endorsement from Biden, whose approval rating is low, may not be an attractive option for all candidates. Most likely voters (51 percent) said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by the president, per a <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/november_2021/most_voters_say_biden_endorsement_would_hurt_local_candidates">Rasmussen Reports poll</a>. </li><li>Americans <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/cnn-poll-biden-job-approval/index.html">aren’t satisfied</a> with how Biden has handled what they say is the nation’s top issue: the economy. A plurality of Americans (36 percent) said the economy was the most important issue in the U.S., according to a <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/11/08/rel7a.-.politics.pdf">recent CNN/SSRS poll</a>. And a majority (58 percent) said Biden hadn’t paid enough attention to the country’s most important problems. </li><li>COVID-19 cases have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/after-weeks-of-declines-us-covid-cases-have-leveled-off-at-a-high-level-the-ers-are-packed.html">stopped declining in the U.S.</a>, but many Americans are ready to return to pre-COVID life. Per a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">recent Axios/Ipsos poll</a>, a small majority of Americans (55 percent) thought returning to their pre-COVID lives now came at a small risk or no risk to their health, and 50 percent of Americans said they felt they were at less risk of contracting COVID-19 now, compared with April 2020. </li><li>About <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/white-house-900000-kids-virus-shots-1st-week-81080149">900,000 children ages 5 to 11 received their first dose</a> of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine just one week after the vaccine was approved for that age group. Before the vaccine was approved, an October <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-october-2021/">Kaiser Family Foundation poll</a> found just 27 percent of parents with children ages 5 to 11 said they would vaccinate their kids “right away” once eligible. That hesitancy was in large part about the long-term effects of the vaccine in children (76 percent of parents surveyed) and that their child might have serious side effects from the vaccine (71 percent).</li><li>On Monday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/travel/usa-travel-restrictions.html#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20reopened%20its,of%20dollars%20in%20tourism%20revenue.">the U.S. lifted a travel ban for vaccinated visitors</a> from 33 countries, including Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This article is a collaboration between FiveThirtyEight and </em><a href="http://fullerproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Fuller Project</em></a><em>, a nonprofit newsroom reporting on issues that affect women.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One day last spring, Naima Kaidi waited nearly an hour for her kindergartener and first-grader to get home from school. She stood on the corner near her house, but the bus was nowhere to be seen and there was no word why it was so late. Northport Elementary in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, had only recently reopened for in-person classes, and day after day, Kaidi’s family had been struggling with late school bus drop-offs. This day was the worst. Cold and worried, she eventually carried her younger children back home to get her phone and try to find out what was going on — and that was when she got a knock on the door. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was Roberta Steele, who had driven the school bus in Kaidi’s neighborhood for years, there to bring the two children home. Steele knew where the kids on her route lived. She knew who their parents were. And even though it wasn’t her fault that the bus was late, Steele made sure the kids arrived home safely. “She helped me, she [brought] my kids over here,” Kaidi said. Even if the bus system wasn’t reliable, the driver was. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that was last school year. Even then there was already a shortage of bus drivers in the district. Steele said that had been the case for years, though district representatives were quick to point out that there had never been a shortage of this magnitude. This fall, the shortage became dire enough that Steele’s old route — the one where she knew all the kids well enough to take them to their doorsteps when needed — was consolidated out of existence. In October, the district told parents that <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/education/robbinsdale-area-schools-bus-driver-shortage/89-0e254e80-1e44-4171-97c9-6b2d509d1da6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 routes probably wouldn’t be staffed</a> this year. Steele was transferred to a different route with new kids, and sometimes the chaos of route changes and late buses meant she also had to drive kids home from other, equally unfamiliar routes.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg" alt="A school bus drops off students" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>The route that Steele drove for years was eliminated by the company that operates buses for the district. <p>Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It isn’t an easy job. The kids don’t behave. Some, unsure of their own addresses, can’t tell Steele where to go. When parents get angry at a system that isn’t working, they blame Steele. And the company that runs the buses has packed her schedule to the point that there’s no longer time left to pee between runs. She’s thinking of quitting, even though she knows that will make things even harder for the families relying on her.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Kaidi’s family spent the first two months of school with no bus at all. Instead of waiting at her corner with other parents, she spent her afternoons sitting in her car in the pickup line outside school. The line backed up for blocks, 40 or 50 cars deep, threading out of the parking lot and down an undulating suburban road. Kaidi had to get there an hour before school ended just to make sure she was near the front. She says she turned down a job so she could do this. Likewise, other parents had to change their hours, lose pay and go without sleep — all to sit in their cars, waiting for their children. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the bus driver shortage continues, parents and drivers, often women on both sides, have been stretched to the breaking point as they try to do more with less — less time, less money, less help, less of a sense of safety and respect. “This problem existed before COVID, but nobody wanted to hear about it, especially the school districts,” said <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10129300/whats-really-causing-the-decimation-of-the-school-bus-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zina Ronca</a>, a driver supervisor for DuVall Bus Service in West Grove, Pennsylvania, who has been <a href="https://stnonline.com/blogs/the-decimation-of-school-bus-contractors-and-the-school-bus-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the industry for nearly two decades</a>. There haven’t been enough school bus drivers nationwide for years. But it took a pandemic to make that shortage visible and painful to more than just the drivers themselves. </p>

Across the country, reports have documented shortages of substitute teachers, school nurses, cafeteria workers and the paraprofessionals who help teachers manage their workloads and give kids more small-group attention. As with drivers, those shortages existed before anyone had ever heard of COVID-19. The problems were there, waiting, and then the pandemic came along and made them simultaneously more visible and more … just <em>more</em>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All these jobs are about service and care, at pay scales that simply aren’t competitive with jobs that use similar skills but don’t require child care balanced precariously on top of other demands. And when the people who do those jobs quit, the effects get tangled up with other parts of the economy and other parts of society. Amid the pandemic, individual workers are making choices for themselves and their families that affect other people’s families and jobs in ways nobody quite expected. The bus driver shortage isn’t just a bus driver shortage — it’s a knot nobody knows how to cut. </p>

But in the third year of school disruption, it turns out that the bus driver is a person in your neighborhood whom you miss when you don’t see them every day. The job involves only a minimal amount of interaction, Roberta Steele told me. But it’s daily interaction. “You know you’re making a difference for some kids, and that brings me great joy,” she said. “I have kids that I had in middle school that are now in high school. And they will walk from the high school to the middle school just to say hi.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Steele, 50, is a barrel-chested woman with cropped, spiky hair the color of her last name. She comes off as perky and outgoing, basically the vibe of a favorite grade-school gym teacher. She doesn’t have kids of her own but places a lot of value in the role she can play in the lives of other people’s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Steele has been driving a school bus since 2014, all of it for Robbinsdale School District 281, one of those sprawling suburban districts that encompass schools and children in multiple cities on the fringes of Minneapolis. She took the job after leaving the Minneapolis Police Reserve but almost quit in the first two years. The kids were just a lot. A typical school bus can carry 70 children when full. They get bored, or they just plain don’t know how to behave. “I resorted to bribery as a method of training,” she told me, using small treats to manage the threat of prepubescent uprisings. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="774" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg" alt="Students board a school bus while wearing face masks" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Kids have had to navigate a new normal on school buses during the pandemic. But bus shortages aren’t a new normal for school districts. They were there before the pandemic and are still there now. <p>Alex Kormann / Star Tribune via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Today, she can quell most bad behavior with a look delivered through the rearview mirror. Her starting pay, driving a 15-ton vehicle down the winding, narrow roads of inner-ring suburbs while managing the behavior of a small village worth of kids, and for which she needed to take classes and earn a special license, was $14 an hour. “It’s really rewarding, or it can be, if you like children, right?” Steele said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But not everyone does. Or, at least, not at that price point. Steele’s entire bus driving career has been marked by not having enough colleagues. She told me she found the job in the first place because the district was recruiting heavily to fill a shortage, though representatives from the district stressed that they had never had a shortage like this before. Nationwide, more than 50 percent of districts have experienced a shortage of drivers every year since at least 2006, according to <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10003422/how-school-bus-driver-shortage-is-linked-to-unemployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual surveys conducted by School Bus Fleet magazine</a>. Most years, the driver shortage affected more than 70 percent of districts. The lowest the shortage has been in all that time was in the depths of the Great Recession.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Over the years, as shortages continued, Steele’s pay did increase. Today, after a big post-COVID pay raise, she’s making $23.75 per hour, well above the nationwide average starting pay for school bus drivers, $18.82 per hour according to <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/research/download?id=10145046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2021 survey</a>. </p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">At year-round, full-time hours — the way the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes533058.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculates an annual wage</a> — the average school bus driver makes more than $39,000 a year. But school bus drivers don’t work year-round, full-time hours. “We’re only guaranteed four hours of pay a day,” Steele said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are no paid holidays or sick days, she and other bus industry experts say. Benefits vary from company to company, and there’s no guaranteed work at all in summer. “Spring break is all unpaid. Every teacher-compensatory day, every snow day, any time they cannot pay us they will,” Steele said. She added that a recent, failed unionization effort among the Robbinsdale bus drivers started in part as a fight for snow-day pay. </p>

This is part of why the job has long attracted women — particularly mothers — who were able to work while their children were at school. In 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58.5 percent of all school bus drivers were women</a>. The hours are predictable and short, with a gap in the middle of the day when your time is your own, during which some drivers earn money doing other jobs, like working as a mechanic for the bus company, or doing a different caregiving job in schools. And the job comes with unusual perks like the ability to take the bus home, turning the morning commute into a walk to the driveway. At some bus companies and school districts, drivers have the freedom to take their young children on the bus with them during their rounds — a chance to bring in money without adding to the ever-rising cost of day care. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/burgoyne-allen-5-things-to-know-about-americas-school-bus-driver-shortage-what-states-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t pay enough to live on</a>. For Steele, the job works only because her partner brings in a paycheck and benefits. Other drivers depend on a second job, performed between roughly 9 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., when they aren’t on the clock. LaShawn Favors, a bus driver in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park, had a second part-time job as a paraprofessional in a school while his wife worked from home in the health-care industry. His route didn’t overlap with where his own kids, who lacked reliable bus service, needed to go, so his wife and his daughter’s boyfriend were stuck shuttling the kids to and from school while Favors rushed from one job to another and back to the first.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Drivers spackle their work lives together this way, with voluntary overtime and luck, and they still struggle. <a href="https://bellwethereducation.org/publication/challenges-and-opportunities-school-transportation-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID didn’t make the job hard</a>, it just made it harder.</p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">Pay is the problem, and COVID made it worse by threatening the unique benefits that kept people driving buses, despite the low pay, to begin with. Older drivers suddenly had to deal with the increased risk of sickness and death, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/we-feel-your-grief-remembering-the-1-000-plus-educators-whove-died-of-covid-19/2021/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risks that haven’t really been properly calculated</a> anywhere. No one knows how many bus drivers are no longer in their jobs because they <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/mounting-covid-deaths-fuel-school-bus-drivers-fears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died from COVID-19 infections</a> acquired on the job, because no one is keeping track. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other drivers had no real choice but to find other work during the long months when schools were remote and had no need of them, while drivers who were mothers found themselves trying to juggle home and work in a job they’d taken precisely so they wouldn’t have to do this in the first place. When schools moved to hybrid systems, the districts needed drivers every day, but those drivers’ own kids’ schedules may not have been in sync, said Erin Ducharme, vice chair of membership for the Women in Buses Council and an executive at Bloom Tour and Charter Services in Taunton, Massachusetts. </p>

Like drivers, school nurses are most likely to be women, and they earn far less than what they could get if they took their skills and training elsewhere — as little as <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$58,810 in median annual wages</a> compared with more than $75,000 if they worked in a hospital. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nationwide, there have been reports of shortages of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/09/06/school-cafeterias-are-looking-for-workers-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cafeteria workers</a>, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/no-bus-drivers-custodians-or-subs-whats-really-behind-schools-staffing-shortages/2021/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custodians, substitute teachers</a> and <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-staff-shortages-are-crushing-schools/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paraprofessionals</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-bad-are-school-staffing-shortages-what-we-learned-by-asking-administrators/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey conducted by EdWeek Research Center</a> in late September and early October, 40 percent of district leaders and principals said they were experiencing “severe” or “very severe” staffing shortages. The bus driver shortage is part of a larger, longer problem in schools — one that extends beyond the school building. When “women’s jobs” go unfilled, other women, namely moms, pick up the slack — and the effects reverberate across the economy. </p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">Caregiving is interconnected. Roberta Steele doesn’t just drive a bus. She drove a bus to pick up and drop off Naima Kaidi’s children. Without Steele’s services, Kaidi still had to get the kids to school. But the task became harder and required her to make more sacrifices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Parents like Kaidi depend on the services of bus drivers, nurses, lunch ladies and subs. Statistically, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/17/the-pandemic-has-highlighted-many-challenges-for-mothers-but-they-arent-necessarily-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the parents who depend on those services the most are moms</a> — they still do more of the parenting labor, and their own jobs become more disrupted when there aren’t other women doing the outsourced work for things like transportation or food preparation. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/12/despite-challenges-at-home-and-work-most-working-moms-and-dads-say-being-employed-is-whats-best-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 Pew Research Center survey</a> of adults in opposite-sex relationships found that 59 percent of women reported handling more of the household chores and responsibilities than their partners, and among those with children under 18 at home, 78 percent of women reported doing more work to manage their children’s activities and schedules. Working mothers were more likely than working fathers to report having to reduce work hours to deal with household or family needs. And during the pandemic, women were twice as likely as men to say they had to juggle “a lot” of parenting duties while simultaneously teleworking. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Low-paid caregiving jobs bind together a lot of big trends happening in the economy, said Abigail Wozniak, a labor economist at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve. And you can see those themes play out in the lives of the women whose children used to ride to school on Roberta Steele’s bus — and now have no bus service at all. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take Amanda Swanson, a neighbor of Kaidi’s, who spent the first months of school making a point of being first in the hour-long pickup line every day at Northport Elementary. She’s supporting her family working as a manager at an Amazon fulfillment center while her husband stays home with their youngest children because child care is too expensive. He used to be able to walk the children to the bus stop. But after the bus stopped running, Swanson switched to an overnight shift and frequently left her job early so she could drive them in the family’s only car. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg" alt="Bus driver Roberta Steele waits for students" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Not long ago, Swanson (or her husband) would have been a prime candidate to <em>be</em> a school bus driver. Instead, she’s working a job that didn’t exist a decade ago but pays enough to keep her family solvent. It’s not just that school-support jobs don’t pay enough, it’s that they’re in direct competition for workers with jobs that pay more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“At least since the 1970s, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wages for the majority of Americans have barely budged</a>, and if anything <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45090.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they've decreased for workers that don't have a college degree</a>,” said Krista Ruffini, a professor of economics at Georgetown University. Even before COVID-19, that squeeze is part of what has made jobs like bus driving less attractive today than they were 20 or 30 years ago, and it’s also put those jobs in competition with newer kinds of work — gig-economy jobs or delivery and warehouse jobs that require the same kinds of skills, pay the same or more, and require less emotional labor, Wozniak said. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="School bus drivers have other job options " aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SHk3V/13/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="410" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">So far, these newer jobs are still a relatively small portion of all jobs and because of that probably can’t explain big, economy-wide trends. “But there will be some employers now who are competing with, basically, Amazon,” she said. A school bus driver could instead drive a delivery vehicle. School support staff like paraprofessionals and lunch ladies have logistics skills that are needed in a warehouse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And when there’s a shortage of school bus drivers, that makes it hard for some parents to take a job. Once her children were finally old enough to be in school during the day, Kaidi had intended to go back to work this fall for the first time in years. But, she said, she’s received multiple job offers she couldn’t accept because of the time she has to spend ferrying her children to and from four different school buildings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Her conundrum makes it easy to understand how <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002402802/there-are-complex-forces-keeping-women-from-coming-back-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pandemic has disproportionately</a> affected <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/why-has-covid-19-been-especially-harmful-for-working-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women’s careers</a>. “On the female side of the labor market, we know that there's been an increase in people that say that they can't work because they're providing care,” Ruffini said. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002402802/there-are-complex-forces-keeping-women-from-coming-back-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some have had to quit</a>; others just don’t reenter the workforce, even when they have an opportunity. That’s been a feature of the pandemic, affecting a wide swath of the kinds of service and emotional-labor jobs that disproportionately employ women — jobs like the ones in schools. Kaidi’s experience shows how shortages in one field can create or exacerbate shortages in another. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, many of the women who have stayed in their emotional-labor jobs are being pushed to a breaking point — women like Swanson and Kaidi’s neighbor Christiana Metzger, a nursing assistant who works nights and has been running on almost no sleep since the beginning of the school year in September. She described breaking the speed limit, exhausted, trying to get home fast enough to take her older children to class on time, preparing meals and picking kids up from school and checking their homework, and the headache she’d had for several days straight. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The jobs done by people like Metzger are what middle-level jobs look like today, said Nicole Smith, chief economist at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Along with the lack of growth in real wages, there’s the idea that the job spectrum has hollowed out, leaving nothing but the worst-paying jobs and the ones that pay well but require college degrees. But that’s not exactly the case, Smith says. There are jobs left in the middle, but they’re no longer in manufacturing — they’re jobs that involve caring for people (like nurses) or supporting other workers (like school paraprofessionals). Again, women’s jobs. Jobs that continually conflict with women’s labor at home.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The emotional and psychological aspects of work are something economists are only just beginning to pay attention to, Wozniak said. But when shortages happen — whether through the cost-saving design of a lean staffing model or a chain of unfortunate events — it’s those intangible, immeasurable parts of a job that can quickly spiral out of control. “Now there are three people in the lunchroom instead of five or eight,” she said. “It’s the same job but not at all the same because you’re doing it faster and with less help.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bus driver shortage is a pay issue, but it’s also clearly more than that. It’s about how your job treats you. It’s about what you’re expected to do outside of the office. It’s about the narrow space women are squeezed into where we need to be better paid for the hard work we do at caregiving jobs but also need other women to do caregiving jobs at a lower price we can afford. It’s about being forced to make a choice between fulfilling your responsibilities at work and getting your children home safely. And it’s about how schools do, and don’t, function.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the end of October, Kaidi, Metzger and Swanson finally got bus service again. But they didn’t get it from Steele, who remains relegated to a different route, increasingly unhappy with the way the bus company and the district are treating her and other drivers. The immediate crisis ended for some of the moms of Brooklyn Center. But the problem isn’t solved. Not for the drivers. Not for the school districts suffering disruption on top of disruption. And not for the nation as a whole. “What’s going on in the labor market is something that we certainly haven’t seen in my lifetime,” Ruffini said. People have been out of work and out of their normal routines for a long time, she noted. Their responsibilities have changed at home. And so have the ways they spend their time and their resources. Nobody knows what happens next. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we do know that what happens with bus drivers is going to affect what happens with a lot of other people. The pandemic didn’t create these shortages. But it made clear how inextricably linked one job is to a whole bunch of others — how our lives and livelihoods are lashed together with cords we can’t usually see. When a time of stress and tragedy makes those invisible bonds more tangible, we can’t go back to pretending they don’t exist. All we can do is try to untangle them together. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">A sample size of two is never sufficient to get an accurate read of what’s happening in politics — let alone what <em>will</em> happen. But in the wake of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2021-elections-live-updates-and-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections last week</a>, that’s what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xSyf1wPN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everyone is trying to do</a>. Still, we’re almost exactly one year away from the 2022 midterm elections, so the temptation is understandable. So, what <em>can</em> last week’s results tell us about the 2022 midterm elections? And what <em>can’t</em> they tell us?</p>



<h2><strong>CAN: Right </strong><strong><em>now</em></strong><strong>, the political environment is significantly more friendly to Republicans than it was in 2020</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the simplest, surest and maybe most important takeaway from the 2021 elections. As we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-virginias-and-new-jerseys-elections-could-suggest-a-red-wave-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last week</a>, the electorates in both states shifted toward the GOP, leading to only about a 3-percentage-point reelection victory for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in fairly blue New Jersey and a 2-point win for Republican Glenn Youngkin in comparably purple Virginia, which marked the first statewide win for the Virginia GOP since 2009. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having looked through the results, we can be really confident that Republicans have an edge right now. And keeping in mind the historical tendency of the party holding the White House to face substantial headwinds in the subsequent midterm election, there’s plenty to suggest that Republicans could have a turnout edge in 2022 as the nonpresidential party. Speaking of …</p>



<h2><strong>CAN: Turnout is likely to be supercharged in 2022 — especially among Republicans</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last Tuesday’s vote demonstrated that Republicans are strongly motivated to turnout. We can see that in the chart below, where the greater the Republican vote share was in a county or city, the better turnout was compared to the 2020 election. While turnout fell everywhere from last November (you’d expect that going from a presidential contest — the highest-profile election in the U.S. — to an off-year election), participation tended to decline less in places that voted more Republican.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1142" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">History shows that this pattern is unsurprising considering there’s a Democratic president in office — and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular one at that</a>. All else being equal, we’d expect the average Republican to be more likely to show up right now than the average Democrat. This “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differential turnout</a>” will be an important factor in the 2022 midterms, although just how much of a turnout edge Republicans will end up having remains to be seen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the broader turnout picture also suggests that our era of high turnout elections seems likely to continue in 2022. Among the nation’s <a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/faq/denominator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting-eligible population</a>, more Americans cast ballots in the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2018g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 midterms</a> (50 percent) and <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2020g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 presidential election</a> (67 percent) than in <a href="http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any midterm or presidential race</a> since the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting age was lowered</a> to 18 in 1971, according to the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Elections Project</a>. Yet while the 2017 elections in Virginia and New Jersey <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-it-time-for-republicans-to-panic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">served as initial markers</a> of high voter engagement early in Donald Trump’s presidency, those contests actually had significantly lower turnout than what we saw this year. Compared with 2017, Virginia’s turnout jumped from about 43 percent to around 53 percent of the voting-eligible population, a modern record for the state, while New Jersey’s increased from around 36 percent to roughly 41 percent.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are estimates based on voting-eligible population data from the &lt;a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;United States Elections Project&lt;/a&gt;, which will not publish new population figures until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a> This doesn’t guarantee that 2022 turnout will outpace the 2018 midterms, but it does portend that participation levels will still be quite high compared with pre-2018 midterms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, the results in Virginia and New Jersey should put paid to the idea that high turnout is a panacea for Democrats. New Jersey and Virginia lean Democratic as a default: According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric</a>, the Garden State is about 12 points more Democratic than the nation as a whole, while Virginia is D+5.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> As such, you might expect a higher turnout off-year election to come closer to falling in line with those partisan baselines. Yet with turnout up in both states from 2017, Republicans won in Virginia and fell just short in bluer New Jersey.</p>



<h2><strong>CAN: Democratic turnout may not be low in 2022, but matching Republicans will be tough</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, considering the high overall turnout, it’s apparent that Democrats also showed up at a relatively high rate in many places — just not quite to the same extent as Republicans. For instance, Fairfax County, Virginia’s most populous locality and one Biden <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/statesub.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51059&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried by 42 points</a> last year, saw its vote total decrease by about the same rate as raw turnout fell in Virginia overall from 2020 (down about 27 percent). But looking ahead to 2022, turnout figures carried warning signs regarding two groups who usually lean pretty strongly toward the Democrats: voters of color and young people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When it came to turnout and race in last Tuesday’s elections, places that were whiter tended to see higher turnout compared with the 2020 presidential race. For instance, in the cities and counties in New Jersey and Virginia that are majority nonwhite, turnout from 2020 fell by 39 percent, compared with a decline of 29 percent in places that were 80 percent white or more. Of course, given the swing toward the GOP in the 2021 elections and the tendency for more Republican-leaning places to see higher turnout, this isn’t surprising. After all, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/american-politics-now-has-two-big-racial-divides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race is one of the strongest predictors of partisan identity</a> — nationally, fewer than 1 in 5 Republicans are nonwhite, while about 2 in 5 Democrats are, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a 2019 Pew Research</a> study — so if GOP turnout was higher, we’d expect greater participation in whiter areas.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, we see evidence that fewer young voters showed up to vote. Turnout dropped precipitously in college towns. Radford and Harrisonburg, small cities in western Virginia with sizable state universities,<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radford University and James Madison University, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> for instance, saw the ninth- and 10th-largest drops in turnout from 2020 across all 133 Virginia cities and counties. And while exit polls are imperfect, 18 to 29-year-olds made up <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2021/november/exit-polls/virginia/governor/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 10 percent of the electorate</a> in Virginia’s exit polls, a decline <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from their share in 2020</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2017-election/va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely compared with 2017 as well</a>, both comparatively more Democratic environments than the current one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With all this being said, a disproportionate dropoff in turnout among voters of color and young voters in nonpresidential elections isn’t unusual. In midterm elections, the electorate has traditionally been whiter and older because a disproportionate number of voters who are young and/or from racial or ethnic minorities <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/how-midterms-do-and-do-not-differ-from-presidential-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to drop out of the electorate</a>. But because Democrats are more reliant on these voters as whites without a college degree — the largest part of the electorate — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-voters-without-a-degree-remained-staunchly-republican-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move toward the GOP</a>, it’s become more critical for Democrats to find ways to ameliorate this midterm turnout decline.</p>



<h2><strong>CAN’T: The 2021 elections signal a GOP swing in 2022 — but not how much of one</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">For all the strong reactions to the New Jersey and Virginia results, however, it’s worth pointing out that it’s entirely normal for those two states to swing away from the president’s party — hell, it would have been strange if they <em>hadn’t</em>. In all but one of the two states’ 16 total gubernatorial elections since 1993, the party in the White House has performed worse than it did the year before in the presidential election. The one exception wasn’t exactly a dramatic one either, as the GOP lost the 2001 New Jersey governor’s race by about 15 points one year after losing by 16 points in the 2000 presidential contest. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Virginia is a more competitive state at its baseline and has more regularly moved away from the president’s party, so observers tend to look at it as a potential indicator of <a href="https://twitter.com/algaraca/status/1455934093422702600?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future midterm results</a>. But for all the focus on Virginia, since the early 1990s it’s been an inconsistent predictor of the next midterm result. From 1993 to 2018, the average difference between the swing in Virginia’s gubernatorial election from the state’s partisan lean and the margin in the midterm national popular vote for the House of Representatives was just shy of 7 percentage points. That error margin — and remember, our sample of elections here is relatively small; there could be an even bigger difference in 2022 — represents the difference between a “meh” or even OK year for Democrats in 2022 and a complete wipeout in both the House and the Senate. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Simply put, the Virginia result can’t tell us exactly what the national House vote is going to look like next year. It gives us only a <em>rough</em> idea of how the political winds might blow as we head into the midterm year.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correlation between that swing and the House vote margin since 1993 is .56, which suggests there’s a somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/how-to-interpret-a-correlation-coefficient-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;positive relationship&lt;/a&gt; between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That makes sense, as the factors that boosted Republicans in 2021, especially <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s poor approval rating</a>, could push voters toward them next year, too. Indeed, the scope of that rightward swing will depend greatly on Biden’s standing — if it improves between now and next fall, that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could fend off some of the Democrats’ potential losses</a>; if it stays where it is or gets worse, Democrats could be looking at another 1994 or 2010, when their party took a thorough shellacking in the House and Senate.</p>



<h2><strong>CAN’T: How coalitions will shift in 2022</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another thing the Virginia and New Jersey races can’t tell us with certainty is just which parts of the two parties’ coalitions are actually sticking with them or shifting disproportionately toward the other party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, might white voters with a college degree stick with Democrats? The exit polls from Virginia suggest Democrats won a narrow majority among them, more or less the same as Biden performed in 2020.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit polls are always at least a little bit prone to error — they are still surveys, after all — but this was &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/exit-polls-can-be-misleading-especially-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;especially true in the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; given how much of the electorate voted absentee. It’s likely this comparison isn’t apples-to-apples but it’s still a useful benchmark for understanding the shift among suburban voters in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>17</sup></a> So it’s possible this group, which <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has trended toward Democrats</a> in recent years, will hold up for the party come 2022. At the same time, an analysis of county-level data in the Virginia and New Jersey races didn’t show much of a relationship between how much Republicans improved over their 2020 showing in a place and how much of the population is white with a college degree. In other words, if Democrats’s support among white voters with a college degree held steady, we might have expected those sorts of places to see comparatively smaller Republican gains, but instead there wasn’t much of a pattern in the data to suggest that happened. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And for all the talk of Democratic losses in the suburbs and rural areas, it’s worth noting that there was a relatively uniform swing toward the GOP across rural, suburban and more urban parts of both New Jersey and Virginia. Using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index</a>,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index is a measure of how densely populated a county or county-equivalent is based on the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of a given resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> we categorized localities in both states into places that are more urban, suburban/exurban, or rural in nature, and found that while suburban and exurban places tended to move the most toward Republicans, the magnitude of those shifts were not all that different from urban and rural areas.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We categorized places with an index of 12 or more as urban, 10 to 12 as suburban or exurban, and below 10 as rural.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps if suburban areas had shifted even more markedly to the right while more urban places stayed in the Democratic camp, we could more convincingly claim that the suburbs in particular swung hard for the GOP. Or if rural areas had moved further to the right than other types of places, we could better make the case that it was rural areas that cost Democrats in Virginia. But the lack of more sizable variations across types of place leaves us with a less obvious conclusion about the role of population density, at least beyond “the environment was good for Republicans.” Although, obviously, if the swings are like this in November 2022, that’ll be all the GOP needs to capture the House and Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, we got little clarity on whether Hispanics continued to notably shift toward the GOP after moving to the right in 2020. The exit polls found that Democrat Terry McAuliffe won about two-thirds of the Hispanic vote, which didn’t differ that much from Biden’s showing in 2020. However, the <a href="https://interactives.ap.org/votecast-2021-va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press’s VoteCast</a> caused a stir when it reported that Youngkin had actually carried Latino voters. The truth might lie somewhere in between, but fundamentally, <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US,VA/PST045219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only about 10 percent of Virginia’s population</a> is Hispanic, so we also know the sample sizes of <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_m_rob/status/1456014764103065600?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hispanics were not especially large in either survey</a>, which produces results that have a larger margin of error. And just to add to the confusion, consider some of the actual vote totals. On the one hand, after taking into account the overall swing toward the GOP, McAuliffe didn’t do exceedingly worse than previous Democratic statewide candidates in a handful of majority Hispanic precincts in <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/the-future-of-vote-tabulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairfax County</a>, and the only place where Murphy more or less matched Biden’s margin was Hudson County (Jersey City), which is 40 percent Hispanic. At the same time, Murphy lost about the same amount of margin in Passaic County, which is 42 percent Hispanic, as he did statewide compared to Biden (14.5 points vs. about 13 points). There’s just not a clear picture.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The results out of New Jersey and Virginia signal that the electoral environment is clearly favorable to Republicans right now, although it can’t tell us just how pro-GOP it’ll be in a year’s time. There’s little question that Republican voters are energized and motivated to turn out to a greater extent than Democratic ones, and Democrats do have to worry about turning out important parts of their base, like young voters and voters of color. But the New Jersey and Virginia contests failed to really tell us just how certain demographic groups might vote next year, or whether they’re continuing to trend toward or away from either party. Part of that is down to having just two major elections to go off of. But it’s also down to a mixed bag of data that offers somewhat contradictory conclusions.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Can white voters who back a Black candidate still hold racist beliefs and views?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That question has come to the fore in the wake of Glenn Youngkin’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gubernatorial victory in the blueish state of Virginia</a>. Conservatives were quick to <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/progressives-cry-racism-to-excuse-democratic-losses-in-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counter claims</a> that Youngkin’s win <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/republicans-critical-race-theory-winning-electoral-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represented the effectiveness of stoking racial fears</a> with results from Virginia’s down-ballot election for lieutenant governor — a contest where the Republican candidate, Winsome Sears, made history by becoming the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia. The Wall Street Journal’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/virginia-governor-election-glenn-youngkin-race-11635979212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editorial board</a>, for example, emphatically mocked the notion that “voters called white supremacists elected a Black Lt. Gov.” Conservative commentators on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-five-media-glenn-youngkin-winsome-sears-virginia-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News and Twitter</a>, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jemele-hill-roasted-for-tweet-alleging-this-country-simply-loves-white-supremacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sears herself</a>, also used the historic victory as an ostensible shield against accusations of Republican racism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But supporting a Black candidate hardly precludes voters from harboring racist beliefs and motivations. Republicans are <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196435/identity-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly more likely than Democrats</a> to hold prejudiced views of minorities, so Black Republicans like Sears often draw especially strong support from white Americans with otherwise anti-Black views simply because they draw most of their support from Republican voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A clear example of this was in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, when Ben Carson made a bid to become the GOP’s first African American presidential nominee. Support for Carson was positively correlated with the belief that Black Americans have too much influence on U.S. politics, according to data from <a href="https://wc.wustl.edu/taps-data-archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington University in St. Louis’s American Panel Survey (TAPS)</a> in late 2015:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1194" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Whites who thought African Americans had “far too little” influence disliked Carson and preferred Hillary Clinton by 60 percentage points in a hypothetical general election matchup. Meanwhile, Carson was very popular among whites who were most concerned about African Americans having “too much” influence in politics. So much so that whites who thought African Americans have “far too much” influence preferred Carson to Clinton by 45 points.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, much of that relationship is down to partisanship — Republicans are more likely to hold prejudiced views and also more likely to support a Republican candidate. But that’s the point: For many white GOP voters, anti-Black views don’t seem to get in the way of supporting a Black Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can see a similar pattern in the January <a href="https://electionstudies.org/data-center/anes-2016-pilot-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 American National Election Studies Pilot Study</a>. Carson received more favorable evaluations among the sizable minority (40 percent) of overtly prejudiced whites who agreed with the racist stereotype that “most African Americans are more violent than most whites.” This group rated Carson significantly more favorably on a 0-100 scale than the white moderate Republican presidential candidate, Jeb Bush (52 to 39, respectively). Then-candidate Donald Trump was the only politician in the survey who was rated higher than Carson among overtly prejudiced whites.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politicians evaluated in the 2016 ANES Pilot Study were: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Ben Carson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a>                </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1002" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-2-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-2-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-2-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-2-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The contrast between how prejudiced whites rated Carson and Obama is rather revealing, as well. The sharp negative relationship between support for Obama and the endorsement of anti-Black stereotypes is consistent with <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300175196/end-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo10443910.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1017/s0022381612000904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00564.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9108-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prejudice</a> was an <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41319767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unusually strong</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272714000929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictor</a> of opposition to Obama from the 2008 election <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Post-Racial-Most-Racial-Politics-Chicago-American/dp/022635301X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the end of his presidency</a>. These patterns also fit well with <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2749510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other</a> <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/changing-white-attitudes-toward-black-political-leadership/D118208EC01BDF5B0FF0A99C92D3BA2E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political science</a> <a href="http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/06/8_-_Ansolabehere_-_68_Stan._L._Rev.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> showing that racially prejudiced whites tend to be more opposed to Black Democrats than to white Democrats.          </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To make sense of why racially prejudiced white Americans are willing to support some Black candidates, it is worth considering why they so strongly oppose Black Democrats in the first place. Given the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691153889/racial-realignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racialized nature of the two-party system</a> in the United States, most Black political candidates are Democrats who embrace liberal positions on issues of race and justice. When asked whether they would support such a candidate, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/voting-hopes-or-fears-9780195101621?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows</a> that racially prejudiced white voters worry that these candidates will represent the interests of Black Americans, both because of a shared African American identity  and because Democrats are <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196435/identity-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived as the party more supportive of Black interests</a>. So, it makes sense that racially resentful white Americans oppose candidates like Obama, as his racial identity <em>and</em> partisanship signaled to voters that he was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Post-Racial-Most-Racial-Politics-Chicago-American/dp/022635301X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more supportive of Black interests</a> than prior presidents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Put another way: Racially prejudiced white voters are not opposed to Black candidates simply because they are Black, but because they believe that most Black candidates will fight for “those people” and not “people like us.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Black Republicans, on the other hand, are <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/70/2/139/1912448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived differently</a> by racially prejudiced white Americans. Their embrace of the Republican Party and its conservative ideology help assure racially prejudiced whites that, unlike Black Democrats, they are not in the business of carrying water for their own racial group. Instead, they are viewed as distinct from other Black elites. If Blackness is viewed as intertwined with a kind of racial liberalism that is antagonistic to the interests of white Americans, Black Republicans’ partisan and ideological commitments allay concerns that they are for “them,” not “us.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This argument is buttressed by more <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/708952?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent scholarship</a> in political science, which has found that Black candidates who embrace a “bootstrap” ideology — an ideology that focuses on individual versus structural explanations of inequality — are more positively evaluated by racially prejudiced whites relative to their white competitors. Explaining this finding, the authors note that racially prejudiced white voters “might find black Republicans delivering an individualism message more favorable than they might find other candidates delivering a similar message precisely because the aesthetic character and the partisan affiliation of the messenger contradict racial and political expectations.” LaFleur Stephens-Dougan, a professor of political science at Princeton University, similarly shows in her book “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo50271574.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Race to the Bottom</a>” that racially resentful whites respond well to Black candidates who take stances against the expected positions of their racial group — a phenomenon she calls “<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/11/how-politicians-practice-racial-distancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial distancing</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, voting for Black Republicans may also be especially appealing to racially prejudiced whites because it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-politics-of-white-liberals-and-white-conservatives-are-shaped-by-whiteness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assuages concerns of being seen as racist</a> by enabling them to say, in essence, “I can’t be racist! I voted for a Black candidate!” Psychologists call this “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167210385920?casa_token=ZYs_NQsQ6UUAAAAA:cYTNozXMv1BaxUXXgOFltZuDZbaMbQDoQ45nK4DO8O1RR3iuzEtNjEBlTDK5SI9Ztd7x9JYXZFKsjg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moral credentialing</a>,” and there’s even <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/march4/obama-moral-credentials-favor-whites-030409.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some evidence</a> that voters who expressed support for Obama shortly after the 2008 election felt more justified in favoring white Americans over Black Americans. Electing a Black Republican like Sears, who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/virginia-republican-winsome-sears-critical-race-theory-nonsense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">railed against critical race theory</a> during the run-up to the election and <a href="https://twitter.com/winsomesears/status/1372941065007816705?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports voting restrictions</a> that <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voter-suppression" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adversely affect racial minorities</a>, is similarly used as a symbolic shield by the entire party from inevitable charges of championing racist policies. As we mentioned earlier, conservative media outlets and politicians are already weaponizing her victory against anyone who would dare suggest so.    </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, the role race and racism play in American politics is much more nuanced than those simplistic defenses suggest. When racially prejudiced whites oppose Black candidates, it’s not just because of the candidate’s skin color. It’s also because they perceive (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3791741.pdf?casa_token=uYKOesmYykcAAAAA:d-YnnVbpIrcuvW4LXifNINvlzmidnOyOxQTynx6PA_gCzCM6mTgTsKU5yeFrYkwWdm1L-cw0WCe0ZpC-6v1hvBAvigo5Du16GgvF0TcyZevRA9wrRw_C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometimes wrongly</a>) that Black candidates, especially Black Democrats, have ideological commitments that are at odds with the interests of white Americans. Likewise, when racially prejudiced whites support Black Republicans, it’s hardly the case that they’ve become progressive on race. Racially prejudiced whites did not vote for Sears because they appreciated her attachment and commitment to Black people. They were willing to support her because they discounted it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Race, after all, is a social construct. It has meaning because we imbue it with meaning. Racially prejudiced whites are not hostile to Blackness, per se. They are hostile to a particular manifestation of Blackness — one that reflects a commitment to racial justice and the advancement of the group’s collective goals. Racially prejudiced whites are not bothered much by a manifestation of Blackness that is ideologically consistent with their own identities and attitudes. Why would they be? Sears’s conservative politics don’t threaten the racial hierarchy, and her candidacy provides cover for a party that’s often antagonistic to racial minorities. For racially prejudiced whites, the real question is what is there <em>not</em> to love about Black politicians like Sears?</p>
