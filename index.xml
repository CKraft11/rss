			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Sen. Joe Manchin told reporters Wednesday that <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/10/senator-joe-manchin-democratic-party-exit-plan-biden-infrastructure-deal-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggestions he would leave the Democratic Party</a> were <a href="https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1450888630977892357?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“bullshit” with a “capital B.”</a> He’d previously <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/21/1048121435/manchin-says-he-offered-to-change-political-parties-if-he-was-a-problem-for-dems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Democratic leaders</a> that <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/577764-exclusive-manchin-says-hes-not-leaving-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’d consider becoming an independent</a> if they felt it would help them explain to the public why the party was having such a hard time coming to an agreement on its social spending plans, but he denied that he’d made threats about leaving the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what if Manchin <em>did</em> leave the Democratic Party? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A Manchin exit would undoubtedly scramble the status quo — Democrats control the Senate only because of Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote — and it could even give Republicans control if Manchin caucused with them. But considering Manchin is often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at loggerheads with his party</a>, it’s not that wild an idea that he might abandon the Democrats and run as an independent in deep red West Virginia. After all, the move might make electoral sense for him if he decides to run again in 2024. But at the same time, if Manchin did switch parties, it would, more likely than not, mean an immediate loss of clout for him in Congress, which is perhaps the biggest reason Manchin is likely to stay put. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For starters, party switches are actually rare. Since 1951, just 34 sitting members of Congress have switched parties (four did so twice, for a total of 38 switches). And as the table below shows, most members who switched parties still ran for reelection or another office after changing their partisan stripes.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Electoral calculations seem to have guided many of these members’ decisions to change parties, too. In his <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/crossing-the-aisle/519F5A3C501380C42ABB4B1E041DC946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study of party switchers</a>, political scientist Antoine Yoshinaka found that members were more likely to switch parties when they represented areas where their old party performed poorly — though they were most likely to switch if they intended on seeking a higher office in the future. However, troublingly for Manchin, Yoshinaka didn’t find that these switches necessarily paid off. In fact, he found party-switchers performed 4 to 9 percentage points <em>worse</em> in their next general election than non-switchers between 1952 and 2010. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Manchin might be better off if he left the Democratic Party and ran as an independent. It will just be really hard for Manchin to win otherwise. Only Wyoming voted more Republican than West Virginia <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i</a>n the <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 presidential election</a>. And despite a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-it-was-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blue wave in the 2018 midterm elections</a>, Manchin <a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/WV/92360/Web02-state.222648/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won reelection</a> by his slimmest margin yet — about 3 points. Moreover, running as a Republican isn’t really an option for Manchin. It’s true that he scores well among Republican voters in West Virginia — a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/04/sinema-manchin-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> recently found 44 percent approved of him — but he would undoubtedly have a challenging time winning a GOP primary, having <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=117&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to impeach former President Donald Trump</a> in February. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So there’s clearly some appeal for Manchin to run as an independent, as he would avoid having to run in a GOP primary while also shedding the national Democratic Party label that’s become toxic to many West Virginians. But this formula is no guarantee of success, as it could easily be upset if a more liberal Democrat ran as the Democratic standard-bearer and garnered a decent chunk of the Democratic vote, likely ensuring a GOP victory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet while one can make a fairly convincing electoral case for why Manchin should consider switching parties, it’s most likely he’ll stay where he is considering the enormous amount of leverage he has. He essentially can <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/joe-manchin-democratic-bill-3-trillion-climate-provisions/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veto any proposal he disagrees with</a> while also working within his party to adjust legislation to better reflect what he wants. And because Democrats have full control of government, he’s more likely to get laws passed that are agreeable to him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Granted, if Manchin were part of a 51-member Republican caucus, he would wield a similar amount of veto power. But outside of that, it’s unlikely he would be as influential as he is right now. He’d likely lose his post as <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/chair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee</a>, a politically advantageous position for a senator from a state <a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/energy_and_environment/manchins-pushback-against-key-climate-policy-leaves-wv-coal-industry-satisfied-climate-advocates-wanting-answers/article_6e62ecaa-d580-5949-a0de-ccbbeb6f973e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeply invested in the coal industry</a>. And he’d also be unlikely to influence the trajectory of GOP legislation in the way he does as a longstanding member of the Democratic caucus.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible Manchin could leave the Democratic Party while continuing to caucus with it and retain his chairmanship, but a public separation from his party would also strain relationships Manchin has spent years building. At home, for instance, Democratic activists might choose to work against Manchin by backing a more liberal challenger despite the difficulty such a candidate would have in winning. Meanwhile, in Washington, a switch could damage Manchin’s trustworthiness with his Senate colleagues and hinder future cooperation with them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All this sounds like a much greater headache than using his current position to get more of what he wants. Moreover, when push comes to shove, leaving the party you’ve belonged to for years is simply very hard to do. Manchin <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/438503-manchin-says-he-supports-collins-reelection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> that his stances on taxes and health care would make it difficult for him to join the GOP, and he’s <a href="https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Senator-Manchin-refutes-speculation-of-a-party-switch--400628491.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed back</a> on <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/19/joe-manchin-interview-trump-franken-podcast-216118/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the idea</a> of <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/01/11/manchin_on_changing_parties_im_a_good_old_west_virginia_conservative_democrat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the Democratic Party</a> many times over the past few years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Long story short, Manchin could switch parties, but it’s unlikely that he will. And in the end, the main result of the party-switching storyline is yet another news clip of Manchin distancing himself from his party, which demonstrates his independence to voters in deep-red West Virginia.</p>]]></description>

	</aside><p data-paragraph="main">This week, Senate Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/politics/voting-rights-filibuster-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked</a> Democrats’ attempts to pass the Freedom to Vote Act — a bill to streamline voting access across the country, reform the redistricting process and bolster the security of voting systems, among other things. Democrats warn that new Republican legislation <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-october-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restricting voting access</a>, along with attempts by former President Trump to overturn the 2020 election, show the vulnerability of the American democratic system and could have grave consequences for the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, we spoke with Adam Schiff, a Democratic representative from California and the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, whose new book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/669172/midnight-in-washington-by-adam-schiff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midnight in Washington: How We Almost Lost Our Democracy and Still Could</a>” addresses why he thinks American democracy is under threat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can read select, lightly edited excerpts below.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Galen Druke, host of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</strong>: How close do you think the United States is to not being a democracy today?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Adam Schiff</strong>: I think we are still very much a democracy, but a lot of the guardrails have come down. Things that we never imagined could happen in this country have happened. It was hard to imagine, post-Watergate, another president of the United States using the Justice Department to protect those who are lying to cover up for him. But that’s what Bill Barr did: in intervening in Roger Stone’s case, someone convicted of lying to Congress and trying to intimidate other witnesses into lying to Congress; by intervening to make the whole case of Mike Flynn go away. But also using that Justice Department to go after the president’s enemies. And of course, the betrayal of that Department of Justice, which is supposed to represent the interests of justice, is only one of innumerable examples. The frequent attacks on the press as the enemy of the people, reportedly trying to raise postal rates on Amazon to punish the Washington Post is using the instruments of state power to censor the press. The flagrant violations of the Hatch Act, the flagrant violations of the Emoluments Clause. … We are still a democracy, but we are also not out of the woods. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: Do you have reason to think that in the future checks on overturning democracy will not hold? Do you think that maybe the Supreme Court would overturn an election? That the United States military would not be on board with the legitimate results of an election? The bad things happened and our system still held. What gives you reason to think it might not hold in the future?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: Well, because we were fortunate in the last election. In a couple of respects, we’re fortunate that Joe Biden won and won handily, and we were fortunate that local and state elections officials did their job and upheld their oaths of office. But those elections officials are being hounded now out of their posts, and replaced with people who would do Donald Trump’s bidding. And where the legal cases brought were frivolous and the lawyers representing the former president were clownish, with hair dye running down their face, we may not be so fortunate the next time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: Why do you think that is? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: Well, I think that is because, again, you know, people like Brad Raffensperger did the right thing. What happens if you have someone in that position that does the wrong thing? What happens if state legislators in Michigan or Pennsylvania this time, adhere to what Donald Trump wants and send a dual slate of electors? What happens if we get to Congress and the Electoral College were tied, and it comes down to a single state, you can imagine the kind of tumult the country would go through, the kind of constitutional crisis we’d be in. So we cannot, I think, take much solace in the fact that the system held, because it barely held.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: Do you think that Americans care about commitment to democracy enough that it will help determine how they vote?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: I’m counting on it. And look, there’s some distressing numbers — talking about polling — distressing numbers of Americans, particularly young Americans, who question whether democracy is the right model. And we’re in a competition not just at home, apparently with where the Republican Party is now, about democracy versus autocracy. But we’re in that competition around the globe. China is advocating what it calls its model that can deliver economic prosperity and law and order. They point to scenes of people climbing on the Capitol building and gouging police as Exhibit A: that democracy can’t maintain order and the economy at the same time. Now, the Chinese model, people need to know, is totalitarianism. And people cannot be lulled into thinking that that’s somehow an alternative to democracy. It isn’t. But around the world, people are questioning whether democracy is the right model. We are in, I think, a struggle not just for the heart and soul of America, but for the heart and soul of people around the world — and with huge consequences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/11/what-you-need-know-about-how-many-americans-condone-political-violence-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About 20 percent of Americans</a> said across a number of surveys that violence is at least a little bit justified if their party did not win the 2020 election. And there was almost no difference between Democrats and Republicans. Of course, the Capitol attack that you’re looking at was amongst Trump supporters. How worried are you about future political violence?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: I’m deeply worried about it. It’s the natural consequence of efforts to cast doubt on the whole elections process. I mean, if you can’t count on the ballot to decide who governs, then you look at other remedies like violence. And so I’m deeply concerned about it. And, you know, the violence was directed at the U.S. Capitol. It may be directed elsewhere — at state capitols, local government. You know, we see around the world dangerous illustrations. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-london-england-eda5b4786c84e68a59de9075efecbcf7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another British parliamentarian stabbed to death</a>. And so this is a terrible trend. You’d be hard pressed to find members of Congress these days that don’t get death threats. And some, like myself, all too regularly. And so yes, it is very much top of mind.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: Bright Line Watch, which is a group of academics who studied democracy globally and here in the United States, <a href="http://brightlinewatch.org/still-miles-apart-americans-and-the-state-of-u-s-democracy-half-a-year-into-the-biden-presidency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started polling Americans</a> about their wishes to break up the country based on region. And, you know, this is just an abstract polling question. But a startlingly high number of people responded that they could support breaking up the country. Is that something that you worry about, like amongst lawmakers when you’re talking about this kind of stuff? Do you talk about worries about violence, civil war, breaking up the country? Like, does it get that bad in your mind?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: Well, it certainly, you know, has us talking about political violence and being extraordinarily alarmed by the prospect of more political violence. I’m not surprised, frankly, by the polling you mentioned — that an increasing number of Americans look with favor on a breakup of the Union. And that ought to set off alarm bells for us. I think part of what has contributed to that is the fact that the reaction to this virus has been so different from place to place, and you need national unity to conquer this violence. If we don’t get vaccinated, we’re never going to be able to put an end to this virus, and we’re going to have to deal with its consequences and preventable deaths for years and years to come. And I think that has really contributed to the amount of anger among those who are vaccinated towards those who are not vaccinated. And, and exposing, you know, the rest of the country to danger and, and economic damage that results from it, I think, is one of the drivers of this.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">By all appearances, former President Donald Trump is planning to run for president again in 2024. He is <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/09/donald-trump-rally-iowa-state-fairgrounds-schedule-2020-election/6035496001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traveling the country holding rallies</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-with-spate-of-2022-endorsements-goes-where-no-former-presidents-gone-before" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staying involved in internal GOP politics</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-political-committees-raise-82-million-2021/story?id=79194850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising vast amounts of money</a>. Reportedly, he was even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-2024-campaign-candidacy/2021/10/03/73af3b12-21f8-11ec-b3d6-8cdebe60d3e2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the verge of announcing his candidacy</a> this past summer, but advisers talked him out of it to avoid subjecting him to restrictions on fundraising and TV appearances.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if Trump does run, one thing is clear: The Republican nomination would likely be his for the taking. He remains <em>extremely</em> popular among Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University poll</a> conducted Oct. 15-18 found Trump has an 86 percent favorable rating and just a 10 percent unfavorable rating among Republican adults. And he already dominates early polls of the 2024 Republican primary. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/13/trump-2024-pence-desantis-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico survey</a> from Oct. 8-11 found that 47 percent of Republican voters would vote for Trump; no other candidate was above 13 percent. And while you should certainly take such an <em>early</em> primary poll with a grain of salt, if Trump is still polling that high come 2023, it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actually bodes pretty well for his chances of becoming the nominee</a>. Plus, given Trump’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-influence-looms-gop-recapture-congress-2022/story?id=76348665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong influence within the GOP</a>, few other Republican politicians would likely dare to run against him anyway.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A sizable majority of Republicans also actively want Trump to run again. By a 67 percent to 29 percent margin, Republican registered voters told Morning Consult/Politico that Trump should run again, including 51 percent who said he should “definitely” run. A <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/577199-poll-just-under-half-of-voters-support-trump-running-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HarrisX/The Hill poll</a> from Oct. 13-14 similarly found that Republican registered voters supported a third consecutive Trump candidacy 77 percent to 23 percent, including 52 percent who “strongly” supported it. And Quinnipiac found that 78 percent of Republicans would like to see Trump run again, and only 16 percent would not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, as more time passes since the end of his presidency, Republicans may be increasingly eager for Trump’s return. Back <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in May</a>, Quinnipiac found Republicans in favor of a Trump presidential run 66 percent to 30 percent — now it’s 78 percent to 16 percent. And while Morning Consult/Politico does not appear to have asked the question before, they <em>have</em> previously asked whether Trump should “play a major role,” “play a minor role” or “no longer play a role” in the Republican Party. Morning Consult hasn’t found as much support for Trump as Quinnipiac, but in their <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/13064013/2110042_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a>, 63 percent of Republican registered voters said a major role, 19 percent said a minor role and 13 percent said no role. That’s slightly up from 59 percent who wanted him to play a major role in <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/02/16103155/210259_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February</a> (when 18 percent said minor role and 17 percent said no role). However, not every pollster agrees that Republicans’ appetite for more Trump has increased: HarrisX/The Hill found virtually no change from their <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/527236-poll-47-percent-of-voters-support-donald-trump-running-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nov. 17-19, 2020, survey</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/adam-schiff-worried-american-democracy-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80716056</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Despite Republicans’ enthusiasm for a Trump comeback, however, the American electorate as a whole is much cooler on the notion. The latest HarrisX/The Hill poll found that registered voters overall opposed Trump running again, 53 percent to 47 percent. Independents were against the idea 58 percent to 42 percent. The margin was even wider according to Morning Consult/Politico (59 percent to 35 percent, with independents opposed 58 percent to 30 percent) and Quinnipiac (58 percent to 35 percent among both independents and adults overall). Quinnipiac also offered some more inauspicious numbers for the ex-president, such as his 39 percent to 52 percent overall favorable/unfavorable ratings and the fact that Americans felt, 51 percent to 41 percent, that he has had a mainly negative impact on American politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But these underwater numbers don’t mean Trump would be guaranteed to lose the 2024 general election. While it’s definitely too early to hang your hat on any 2024 general-election polls, a <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2021-10/GCNP%20Oct21%20Toplines%20Methodology%20Crosstabs%20v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selzer &amp; Co./Grinnell College poll</a> conducted Oct. 13-17 found that 40 percent of likely 2024 voters would vote for President Biden, and 40 percent of likely 2024 voters would vote for Trump. There’s plenty of time for those numbers to change, of course, but even against an unpopular Trump, no one should assume Biden, should he run again, will win reelection in a landslide.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The Biden administration announced Wednesday <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-announces-vaccine-plan-kids-11-states/story?id=80589544">a plan to vaccinate children age 5 to 11</a>, as the Food and Drug Administration reviews Pfizer and BioNTech’s request for authorization of their COVID-19 vaccine in kids under 12. If the vaccine is authorized, roughly 28 million more children would be eligible. This plan may come as a relief for some parents with kids under 18. Per a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/14/children-coronavirus-vaccines-eligibility-polling/">recent Morning Consult poll</a>, 45 percent of parents said they would get their children vaccinated as soon as they’re eligible.</li><li>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pete-buttigieg-defends-paternity-leave-supply-chain-issues/story?id=80670846">has been criticized</a> for taking paternity leave following the birth of his twins in August, sparking a debate over whether new fathers should be able to take time off work. But public polls suggest more American fathers are taking responsibility for child care. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/">Pew Research Center survey</a> found that in 2016, fathers said they spent an average of 8 hours a week on childcare, up 5.5 hours from 1965. Some fathers might also welcome the opportunity to take paternity leave, as most fathers with children under 18, 63 percent, told Pew they thought they spent too little time with their kids. Moreover, 62 percent of those fathers said work was the reason they didn’t spend enough time with their children.</li><li>The most ambitious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html">part of Biden’s climate plan</a>, a program to replace coal- and gas-fired plants with renewable energy sources, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/18/politics/clean-energy-program-budget-bill-climate/index.html">will likely be cut</a> due to Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition. This move might upset some voters, though. A <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/10/dfp-vox-bbb-oct12-toplines.pdf">Vox/Data for Progress</a> poll found that 63 percent of likely voters support incentives for companies who meet clean-energy performance goals and penalties for those who don’t comply.</li><li>Overall, Americans are split on the extent to which the United States should prioritize the environmental or economic impact of its infrastructure investment. An <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/2021-Global-Infrastructure-Index">Ipsos poll</a> found that 37 percent of Americans said they preferred prioritizing the environment while 34 percent preferred the economy. One thing is clear, though: Satisfaction with U.S. infrastructure is at a five-year low, per Ipsos. Sixty-one percent of Americans agree that “as a country, we are not doing enough to meet our infrastructure needs.”</li><li>For most Black Americans, opposing racism is an essential part of being faithful or moral, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/19/across-religious-groups-a-majority-of-black-americans-say-opposing-racism-is-an-essential-part-of-their-faith/">recent Pew poll</a>. This was especially true among the 67 percent of respondents who said being Black is a very important part of their identity, including Black Americans from different religious backgrounds. Of those who thought being Black was a very important part of their identity, 78 percent said opposing racism was important in their faith and morals. Only 70 percent of those who said that being Black was less important to their identity said the same.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Over his first nine months in office, President Biden <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/23/views-of-biden-and-congressional-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has lost support</a> among Americans of all stripes — men and women, Black voters and white voters, Zoomers and Baby Boomers. Even Democrats writ large are more disenchanted. But two groups with whom Biden has lost support stand out: independents and Hispanics. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/politics/independents-biden-losing-fast/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Independents have soured</a> on Biden to the extent that his approval ratings among this group approach the <a href="https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/trump-job-approval/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=100&amp;mindate=2000-01-01&amp;maxdate=2021-10-19&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=no&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A,A%20-%20D,A%20-%20R,RV,RV%20-%20D,RV%20-%20R,LV,LV%20-%20D,LV%20-%20R&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=approve,disapprove&amp;fudge=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly negative ratings they gave then-President Donald Trump</a> at the same point in his presidency, while increased disapproval of Biden among Hispanics <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/13/biden-is-bleeding-support-hispanic-voters-democrats-should-be-petrified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could signal they are moving further away from Democrats</a> after they <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted somewhat toward Trump and the GOP</a> last November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not that unusual for a president’s approval rating to drop over the course of the first nine months in office. A president’s “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-should-we-expect-of-bidens-approval-rating-in-the-first-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeymoon period</a>” has usually ended by then, as opposition to the president’s agenda coalesces and the new administration’s actions spark criticism. As the chart below shows, most recent presidents have seen their approval ratings fall after their first few months in office, although there have been some notable exceptions.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1036" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.1-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.1-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.1-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.1-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">For instance, Biden, Trump and Barack Obama all experienced clear descents during their first nine months in office, albeit from different starting points: Biden has fallen from the mid-50s to the mid-40s, Obama fell from the mid-to-high 60s to the low 50s, and Trump fell from the mid-40s to the high 30s. But former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush didn’t really follow this pattern. Clinton’s approval rating did <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton-fickle-favours-presidential-popularity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decline a few months into his presidency</a>, but in a possible sign of hope for Biden, Clinton’s approval rating ticked back up after hitting the summer doldrums. Meanwhile, in 2001, Bush’s approval rating didn’t change much until it skyrocketed following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a textbook example of the “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-explains-the-bump-in-trumps-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally-around-the-flag effect</a>.”</p>

In fact, while Biden’s approval rating has seemingly stabilized in the mid-to-low 40s, there’s also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-approval-rating-isnt-bouncing-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no indication that his approval rating is about to bounce back</a>. And part of that comes down to Biden’s rough numbers among independents and Hispanics, in addition to his standing on important issues like COVID-19 and the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps the most obvious place where Biden has lost support is among independents. Across the polls we collected that measured support by party ID, Biden’s approval has dropped from 50 percent among independents in the late spring and early summer, to below 35 percent now, as the chart below details. His slides among Democrats and Republicans haven’t been nearly as sizable.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1038" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.2-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.2-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.2-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.2-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that Republicans never gave Biden much of a chance and that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-americans-who-identify-as-independent-are-actually-independent-thats-really-bad-for-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most independents lean toward one party</a>, but independents are still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/just-how-many-swing-voters-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more politically malleable</a> than Democrats or Republicans. In that sense, it’s a real problem for Biden that the most moveable group of voters now largely disapproves of the job he is doing as president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s sharp decline among independents also seems related to what has often been Americans’ <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number-one concern</a> since <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/353012/coronavirus-ticks-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden took office</a>: the COVID-19 pandemic. This has surely hurt Biden with most groups of Americans, but independents’ dissatisfaction with Biden’s handling of the pandemic has been particularly pronounced. In early June, almost 60 percent of independents approved of Biden’s response to the coronavirus, but that has now fallen to just below 42 percent, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s coronavirus approval tracker</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1388" height="670" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley_BIDENAPPROVAL_1021_screenshot.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley_BIDENAPPROVAL_1021_screenshot.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley_BIDENAPPROVAL_1021_screenshot.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley_BIDENAPPROVAL_1021_screenshot.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Independents are also especially dissatisfied with how Biden is handling the economy. Granted, this week <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/mzvq4c7ty8/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> found only 41 percent of Americans approved of Biden’s handling of jobs and the economy, while a brand-new <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/20054637/2110084_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult survey</a> found just 41 percent of registered voters approved of his handling of the economy. But this is a drop from where his numbers stood on these issues in early June, when <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/y3gecetbxy/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> polling had him 8 percentage points higher and <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/06/16051615/210691_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult</a> polling had him 6 points higher. Yet independents have been even more displeased with Biden’s handling of the economy, as their approval on that issue fell from the low 40s in June to around 30 percent more recently.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Garnering support from independents is important because it helps a president achieve overall popularity, but support from the base is vital too — and it’s another spot where Biden is in trouble. While his job approval rating among Democrats remains very high, it has dipped from 90 percent in the early summer to the low 80s now, with signs of deteriorating support among Black and Hispanic Americans, who are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to identify as Democratic</a> than white Americans. As the chart below shows, there has been a drop in support for Biden among all three racial and ethnic groups we measured, but the drop among Hispanics — from the high 60s to slightly below 50 percent — marks Biden’s most precipitous decline.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1062" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.3.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.3.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling suggests that Hispanic approval of Biden’s handling of the pandemic and the economy has fallen sharply. The latest poll from The Economist/YouGov found just 45 percent of Hispanics approved of Biden’s handling of the pandemic, compared with 65 percent in early June. And Politico/Morning Consult’s new survey found Hispanic approval of Biden’s handling of the economy has dropped to 42 percent, compared with 60 percent back in June. Hispanics are also frustrated with how Biden has dealt with immigration — long <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-handling-of-the-pandemic-polls-better-than-his-overall-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Biden’s weakest issues in the public’s eyes</a> — and although it isn’t <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-latino-voters-havent-completely-abandoned-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most important issue for Hispanic voters</a>, it is often a highly salient one. Earlier this month, <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University found</a> that only 23 percent of Hispanic Americans approved of Biden’s work on immigration, down from 49 percent <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in late May</a>. Even if that might be on the low end for Biden, the new Politico/Morning Consult survey also found him performing more poorly on the issue among Hispanic voters, as just 40 percent approved, compared with 51 percent in June.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden has lost ground among almost every single demographic group over the past few months, but independents and Hispanics stick out as two key groups where Biden’s standing has especially faltered. For Democrats looking ahead to the 2022 midterms, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s overall approval rating is concerning enough</a>, but if Biden is struggling to win independents and Hispanics, that could snuff out any hope Democrats have of holding either chamber of Congress. After all, independents backed Democrats <a href="https://medium.com/@yghitza_48326/revisiting-what-happened-in-the-2018-election-c532feb51c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 2018 midterms</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden last November</a>, and even though Republicans made gains with Hispanics in places like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas’s Rio Grande Valley</a>, Hispanics still largely backed Biden and helped him win in key swing states, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Elections/arizona-exit-polls-2020-us-presidential-election-results-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Arizona</a>. But if Republicans can capitalize on Biden’s weakness among these groups, that could be their ticket back to controlling Congress next year.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Before President Biden entered the White House, he had an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/biden-promises-100-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressive list of to-dos</a> on his agenda, including but not limited to: passing federal voting rights legislation, restructuring policing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-has-and-hasnt-changed-since-george-floyd-was-murdered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the murder of George Floyd</a> and creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But these three agenda items have another thing in common: None have passed Congress yet. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today,<strong> </strong>Democrats (again) attempted to pass <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-republicans-defeat-voting-rights-reform-bill/story?id=80643465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a compromise version of a voting rights bill</a>, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-wont-support-sweeping-voting-rights-legislation-now-or-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans rejected</a> it (again). Police reform <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/year-george-floyds-killing-congress-agree-police-reform/story?id=80188065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met a similar fate</a> in September. And earlier that month, Democrats faced another setback after the Senate parliamentarian excluded a pathway for citizenship for immigrants <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/senate-parliamentarian-sets-back-dems-immigration-push-80117636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the upcoming reconciliation bill</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, in a highly polarized Congress, it was always likely that not <em>all </em>of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democratic-priorities-will-make-it-through-congress-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s priorities would pass</a>. But the current failure of these three measures in particular — all of which disproportionately affect people of color — poses a real problem for the Biden administration, especially given that part of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/bidens-plan-for-getting-big-things-done.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his political strategy</a> has been to pass popular legislation. It raises the question: popular for whom?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/public-supportive-of-many-voting-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All three</a> of these bills that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/315962/americans-say-policing-needs-major-changes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed Congress</a> are at least <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/7/dfp_immigration_pathway.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat popular</a> with American voters, but they’re also the Democrats’ agenda items that most explicitly tackle race. As such, their fate hangs in limbo, in part, because some Democrats — including Biden — have long struggled <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-is-unlikely-to-talk-meaningfully-about-race-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to meaningfully address race-related issues</a> for fear of alienating white voters. Some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-falling-poll-numbers-georgia/2021/10/10/3606c99e-2002-11ec-8200-5e3fd4c49f5e_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting already suggests that</a> Black voters in Georgia aren’t pleased with Biden’s presidency, and because polls show his approval rating slipping <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/23/views-of-biden-and-congressional-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among key Democratic constituencies</a>, Democrats face a big risk if they don’t deliver on promises they made, particularly those to voters of color. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one, we’re already seeing the effects of Biden’s and Congress’s inaction on certain reforms. Polling from the Pew Research Center shows that Biden’s favorability has already dropped with most voting blocs — including Democrats. Among Democrats and those who lean Democratic, Biden’s approval rating fell from 88 percent in July to 75 percent in September. And among Black and Hispanic Americans, there was a steeper decline. Eighty-five percent of Black adults approved of Biden in July, but this fell to only 67 percent by September; during the same timeframe, Biden’s numbers among Hispanic adults tumbled from 72 percent to 56 percent. His support among Asian Americans also dropped from 68 percent to 54 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other polls show a similar decline among voters of color. Per an October <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/14/biden-black-voters-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult survey</a>, Biden’s net approval rating among Black voters slipped from 68 percent on Aug. 1 to 43 percent by Oct. 12. And among Hispanic voters, whom Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/13/biden-is-bleeding-support-hispanic-voters-democrats-should-be-petrified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already struggling with</a>, an early October poll from The Economist/YouGov found that <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/j46zs8picp/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a narrow majority</a> (51 percent) saw the president in a favorable light.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, we don’t know why voters of color and Democrats writ large have begun to see Biden less favorably. His approval numbers <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began slipping before September</a>, in part because of the spread of the highly contagious delta variant and because of his administration’s handling of the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. Other surveys note that Biden’s <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/22/biden-black-voters-vaccine-mandate-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal vaccine mandate</a> didn’t go over too well with unvaccinated Black voters, either. But it’s notable that the policies that are now slipping through the cracks are the ones that will have the most obvious impact on people of color, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who lean Democratic</a> and have been a reliable source of support for Biden. It’s also too early to know whether voters of color will negatively judge Biden for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-abandon-free-community-college-white-house-warns-social-safety-n1281939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting tuition-free community college</a> from Democrats’ reconciliation bill, but <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/11/democrats-overwhelmingly-favor-free-college-tuition-while-republicans-are-divided-by-age-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew found</a> that making tuition at public colleges and universities free was overwhelmingly popular with Black (86 percent), Hispanic (82 percent) and Asian American (69 percent) voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats will blame Republican obstructionism for why legislation on voting rights, immigration and police reform have failed so far. And of course, there is disagreement among Democrats — namely, moderate Sens. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kyrsten-sinema-is-confounding-her-own-party-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyrsten Sinema</a> of Arizona and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Manchin</a> of West Virginia — on how much of Biden’s agenda should pass, including whether to abolish or alter the filibuster so that Democrats can pass more of their priorities. But because Democrats control the White House and Congress, it might be hard for them to persuade voters, particularly voters of color, that the president has done everything in his power to deliver meaningful change since getting into office — a point that Cleve R. Wootson Jr. of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-falling-poll-numbers-georgia/2021/10/10/3606c99e-2002-11ec-8200-5e3fd4c49f5e_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a> argued earlier this month.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On voting rights specifically, there’s a clear racial divide on its importance. According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/22/wide-partisan-divide-on-whether-voting-is-a-fundamental-right-or-a-privilege-with-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July report from Pew</a>, Black (77 percent), Hispanic (63 percent) and Asian Americans (66 percent) were all far more likely than white Americans (51 percent) to label voting a fundamental right rather than a privilege with responsibilities. In June, a separate <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/06/09050746/210636_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> found that Black Americans (64 percent) were significantly more likely than Hispanic and white Americans (47 percent each) to think restricting voting access was a major threat to American democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, the Biden administration’s current failure to pass bills that would help people of color isn’t that surprising, since Democrats have long struggled on how best to address race and racism. But ignoring these issues — or letting them fail completely — could have negative impacts on Democrats in the near- and long-term future. As Wootson Jr. notes, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-is-unlikely-to-talk-meaningfully-about-race-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we’ve written previously</a>, some voters of color already feel taken for granted by the Biden administration, and further policy failures might give voters of color yet another reason not to turn out for Democrats in the future.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Everyone keeps waiting for the Supreme Court’s big right turn — especially this year. The justices have now begun their first full term with a 6-3 conservative majority, and the docket is full of culture-war issues, such as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/26/990846329/supreme-court-to-take-up-first-major-gun-rights-case-in-more-than-a-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gun rights</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/02/1012586995/the-supreme-court-will-hear-a-case-on-the-funding-of-religious-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religious liberty</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in many ways, the Supreme Court’s conservative revolution is already here: The court hasn’t been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-unusually-big-jump-to-the-right-might-look-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this ideologically tilted</a> in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/politics/supreme-court-conservative/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost 100 years</a>. Capturing the full breadth of this shift is difficult because the metrics we use to measure the court’s ideology are driven by hard-to-track factors like the types of cases the court takes up. For the first time in decades, too, a single justice isn’t holding the reins. The conservative justices can now assemble a majority more easily, giving them the power to push the court even further right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That power may take some adjusting to — for both the public and the justices. The past term showed that there will still be plenty of room for disagreement on the precise path forward. One example was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-has-carved-out-one-religious-exemption-after-another-the-next-may-be-a-blow-to-lgbtq-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a high-profile religious liberty case</a> where the most conservative justices <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/17/alito-supreme-court-trump-495121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took their fellow GOP appointees to task</a> for issuing a ruling they saw as too timid. And the main priority of the liberal justices, now distinctly in the minority, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/supreme-court-breyer-sotomayor-kagan/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared to be damage control</a>. Moreover, some big decisions were taking place outside the public eye.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Right now, I see two courts in action,” said <a href="https://www.epstein.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee Epstein</a>, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies the Supreme Court. “We see a standard Roberts court that leans conservative but has a serious amount of consensus and tries to look pretty nonpartisan. Then, within that court, we have an aggressive, socially conservative court led by the three Trump appointees plus [Justice Clarence] Thomas and [Justice Samuel] Alito.” Epstein told us that was likely why the justices decided to hear two extremely high-profile cases on abortion and gun rights this term — a signal that at least some conservative justices thought they now had the numbers to push the law to the right on those issues. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We don’t know how those cases will come out, of course, but the justices don’t have to overturn Roe this year for the court to still be deeply conservative. Friction among the conservatives isn’t necessarily a sign that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/supreme-court-conservative-shift-hits-bump-with-moderate-rulings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court is moderating</a>; it may simply take time for the GOP-appointed justices to work out their plans for the enormous amount of power they now wield. Life tenure grants them plenty of space to hash out these differences. This means we need to start watching the court in new ways — and stop waiting for the justices to suddenly accomplish all of conservatives’ legal goals at once. It’s the overall trajectory of the court that matters, and there’s no sign that it will disappoint conservatives in the long term.</p>



<h2><strong>The court is already very conservative</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s get one thing out of the way: This is a very conservative Supreme Court. According to the <a href="http://scdb.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court Database</a>, 60 percent of all decisions last term went in a conservative direction, as well as 59 percent of close decisions — which is to say, decisions in which the minority side had three or four votes. That makes the court’s previous term the most conservative term since 2008, just three years after John Roberts <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/29/roberts.nomination/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assumed his seat as chief justice</a>.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Early in the Roberts years, the court was seen as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/us/25roberts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most conservative in decades</a>. After Roberts and <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5181091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alito</a> were nominated by then-President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate, the court issued a slew of highly conservative rulings, deciding to uphold <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2007/06/06/the-high-court-upholds-the-federal-partial-birth-abortion-ban-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ban on second-trimester abortions</a>, to include <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/27/washington/27scotus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an individual right to bear arms</a> as a part of the Second Amendment and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut the Voting Rights Act</a>, freeing states with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices to change their election laws without federal approval. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That pattern shifted somewhat abruptly around 2012. The share of cases that went in a conservative direction dropped below half in the 2013 and 2014 terms, and then hovered around 50 percent until last term, when the share of conservative court decisions skyrocketed. And this time the court’s sudden lurch to the right may last, as the court appears to be hearing increasingly conservative cases. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The court is asked to hear <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/reportersguide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thousands of cases each year</a>, which makes it very difficult to know whether the kinds of questions the justices are asked to contemplate are changing — if, for example, conservative legal advocates have begun bringing more cases that directly attack liberal precedents. There also isn’t any data to help us look for patterns in the pool of cases the court can pick from — or in the cases it ends up taking.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the court’s docket seems to be shifting, according to several legal experts we spoke with. <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/clark-tom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Clark</a>, a political scientist at Emory University who studies the judiciary, pointed to the fact that the justices agreed to hear a gun rights case for the first time in over a decade as evidence. “That’s not a case [the conservatives] take unless they think they can win,” he said.</p>



<h2><strong>But the conservative justices might still disagree with each other</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">That the court is increasingly tilting to the right, however, does not mean that the justices will deliver conservative victories on every high-profile issue — or that they’ll be unified about the best approach. Now that they have a solid six-justice majority, the GOP appointees have a new luxury or a new challenge, depending on how you look at it: They can disagree with each other. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because for the first time in decades we’re not in a situation where a single swing justice controls the court. Instead, several justices are bunched together around the median.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1252" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ATD-bronner.SCOTUS-REVOLUTION.1020.2stepchart.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ATD-bronner.SCOTUS-REVOLUTION.1020.2stepchart.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ATD-bronner.SCOTUS-REVOLUTION.1020.2stepchart.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ATD-bronner.SCOTUS-REVOLUTION.1020.2stepchart.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Epstein said that between 2005 and 2017, when Justice Anthony Kennedy was the median justice, it was easier to foresee where the court would come down on a specific issue because in many cases where he was the deciding justice, his ideology was well-known. Similarly, when Roberts took over the role of swing justice around 2018, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roberts-is-the-new-swing-justice-that-doesnt-mean-hes-becoming-more-liberal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he appeared to take a more moderate stance</a> in cases where the court’s institutional reputation was at stake. But now there are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-might-have-three-swing-justices-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several potential “swing” justices</a>. To produce an outcome that sides with the liberal justices, it now takes <em>two</em> conservative justices to defect in close cases. This makes it much harder to predict how the court will rule.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And fissures among the conservative justices could lead to some unpredictable and confusing outcomes. Consider the rate at which the justices joined the majority opinion last term. Even with a conservative majority, the GOP-appointed justices weren’t on the same page about every decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you look at how often each justice agreed fully with the majority opinion in close cases — which is to say, they signed onto the opinion without writing their own separate opinion outlining different reasoning or a disagreement — two factions among the conservatives emerge.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Agreement-7.2.21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to SCOTUSBlog&lt;/a&gt;, “Full agreement is defined as two justices joining the same opinion(s) in all parts, without writing separately,” and “Partial agreement is defined as two justices joining at least part of the same opinion, even if one writes separately.” A justice’s partial agreement score includes the share of opinions they agreed with fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett are in one camp, much likelier to be in full agreement with the majority opinion. While Justices Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Thomas are far less in step. In fact, Thomas had the lowest rate of full agreement of any of the justices, including the liberal justices.</p>

Close cases are those in which the minority side had 3 or 4 votes. This excludes cases without a signed majority, such as per curiam cases.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, this picture shifts when we look at the number of times that justices <em>partially</em> agreed with the majority opinion — which is to say, they joined at least part of the opinion but might have written a separate opinion outlining a different perspective. Thomas is still somewhat of an outlier among the conservative justices, with an agreement rate of 50 percent, but Gorsuch and Alito’s agreement rate jumps very close to the other Republican appointees. That signals that Gorsuch and Alito weren’t fully at loggerheads with their fellow conservatives about the outcome in many close cases, though they still disagreed about some component of the majority opinion’s reasoning. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is why each justice’s perspective on specific issues could matter more in the upcoming term; their ability to persuade each other will be key, too. Take abortion rights. Five of the conservative justices may agree that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 opinion that established a constitutional right to abortion, should be overturned, but that wouldn't mean they’d be on the same page about <em>how</em> to do it. And that makes a difference for how far-reaching the court’s rulings will be. For instance, when it comes to abortion, the justices may end up with a compromise ruling that narrows the constitutional right to abortion without getting rid of it entirely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, that’s still bad news for the liberal justices. They’re likely to find themselves compromising a lot more since, ultimately, the conservatives are in the drivers’ seat. Clark pointed out that when Roberts was nominated to the Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/20/politics/politicsspecial1/in-pursuit-of-conservative-stamp-president.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he was criticized</a> as a Republican partisan and likely foe of abortion rights. “Now, he could end up in the minority of a case overturning Roe v. Wade,” Clark said. “That’s how conservative the court is right now.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The question, he added, isn’t whether liberals will lose on big cases — it’s how badly they will lose. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that can be a tricky thing to track because what looks like consensus among the justices may be the liberal justices moderating their stances in the hopes of keeping the conservative justices from going too far. That appears to have been what happened in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/us/supreme-court-gay-rights-foster-care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that religious liberty case from last term</a>. The decision was ostensibly unanimous, but in reality, the court was split. In that case, the liberal justices “won” by preserving the status quo — a dynamic that might persist in future terms. </p>



<h2><strong>Some important decisions are happening outside the public eye</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Increasingly, too, the justices are making big decisions without fully explaining their reasoning, through cases that have emerged through the court’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/politics/supreme-court-shadow-docket-texas-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shadow docket</a>,” where <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/supreme-court-shadow-docket.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the justices are asked to rule quickly</a>, without the extensive legal briefing or oral arguments that happen in normal Supreme Court cases. Sometimes, these orders are only one sentence long. And the justices don’t have to say how they voted or why.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Normally, <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1961&amp;context=public_law_and_legal_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this swiftness and secrecy</a> isn’t especially newsworthy because the rulings that come out of the shadow docket just aren’t that significant. But that has changed in recent years. Some of the court’s biggest rulings in the past year — including its decision to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-california-coronavirus-church/2021/04/10/182faec2-99e8-11eb-962b-78c1d8228819_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strike down COVID-19 restrictions</a> on religious gatherings and its decision to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/-shadow-docket-use-in-supreme-court-abortion-ruling-fuels-angst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow a highly restrictive abortion law to go into effect in Texas</a> — came out of the shadow docket. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The shadow docket is very difficult to track, for obvious reasons — it’s hard to know what the justices are even doing. But scholars like <a href="https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/stephen-i-vladeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Vladeck,</a> a law professor at the University of Texas-Austin, have found evidence that the Supreme Court’s use of the shadow docket has changed over the past few years. For instance, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Vladeck-SCOTUS-Commission-Testimony-06-30-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to data collected by Vladeck</a>, the number of cases in which the justices changed the legal status quo — for example, lifting an injunction imposed by a lower court — used to be very low, numbering in the single digits each year. That has changed recently, though. In the 2019 term, the court disrupted the status quo in 19 shadow-docket cases, and the same thing happened in 17 shadow docket cases in last year’s term.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What we don’t know is why this is happening or how this fits into the broader ideological shifts on the court. And that’s a big problem for making sense of what little data we do have. Many of the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/24/supreme-court-nevada-covid-rules-can-favor-casinos-over-churches/5454128002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shadow-docket rulings</a> that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/28/928890290/supreme-court-allows-ballot-extensions-in-pennsylvania-north-carolina-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made news</a> did <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/bidens-supreme-court-losses-prompt-more-shadow-docket-scrutiny-2021-08-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split along ideological lines</a>. But what these decisions mean for the overall tilt of the court is much harder to say.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those examples suggest that the Supreme Court — which was already quite conservative — has recently transformed into an even more ideologically extreme body. And to understand what the court is doing, we need to stop relying on outdated ways of thinking about the justices. We aren’t in the land of a single swing justice anymore. Now, a more complex negotiation among the conservative justices will determine the outcome in important cases. There is a distinct possibility that we are heading into a blockbuster term with some significant victories for the conservatives, too. But more than anything, this term will tell us a lot about <em>how</em> the conservatives intend to move forward — because it’s pretty clear already what direction they’re heading.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-us-capitol-riot-no-responsibility-03eccd4b09d7acb6f5cce304a0afdf42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first public appearance</a> after the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-what-led-to-the-attack-on-the-capitol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack on the U.S. Capitol</a>, then-President Donald Trump sought respite in South Texas. His visit was billed as a way to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/09/donald-trump-texas-rio-grande-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico</a>, but it also gave him a welcome escape from the turmoil in Washington. That’s because, just months prior, voters in Texas’s border region <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/05/us/texas-election-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted sharply toward Trump</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Trump isn’t the only Republican to see success in South Texas. In June, Javier Villalobos, a former Hidalgo County GOP chair, <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2021/06/08/texas-republicans-celebrate-mayoral-win-in-mcallen-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly bested Veronica Vela Whitacre</a> in a McAllen municipal election. Though the race was technically nonpartisan, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/11/texas-republicans-mcallen-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local GOP officials insisted</a> Villalobos was the first registered Republican elected mayor of the city this century. “The macro realignment accelerates in South Texas, and elsewhere, as Hispanics rally to America First,” former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes <a href="https://twitter.com/CortesSteve/status/1401506899602907138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted at the time</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s why Republicans, headed into the 2022 midterms, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/10/2022-texas-congressional-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan to campaign in the area more heavily</a> now than they did before. Moreover, through the redistricting process, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which Republicans control</a> in Texas, they have positioned themselves to hold a sizable and long-term majority of House seats, including by making it easier to win <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-congressional-map-could-give-a-huge-boost-to-gop-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least one border-area district</a> currently represented by a Democrat. Whether Republicans will continue to make inroads in the Texas counties along or near the border is unclear — there is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/11/17/trump-latinos-south-texas-tejanos-437027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflicting evidence</a> over <a href="https://www.vox.com/21551025/latino-national-vote-biden-trump-2020-florida-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just how much</a> Hispanic voters moved toward the GOP in 2020 — but if Republicans are successful there, it might not mean a death knell for Democrats hoping to turn Texas blue. That’s because Democrats have made sizable gains in the Texas suburbs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The state as a whole has <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2012/sep/26/texas-democrats-have-lost-statewide-elections-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long voted reliably Republican</a>, but about two-thirds of Texas’s population lives in one of the state’s four huge metropolitan areas — Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. If you combine all the votes there, Democrats improved their margin by more than 5 percentage points between 2016 and 2020, carrying these areas 52 percent to 47 percent in November. This shift is significant because even though Texas’s border counties moved sharply to the right in 2020 — Starr County, for instance, swung a staggering 55 points toward Republicans — Democrats’ gains in those four big cities and their suburbs added almost five times as many votes as Republicans’ gains in 28 counties along or near Texas’s border with Mexico.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewster, Brooks, Cameron, Culberson, Dimmit, Duval, El Paso, Frio, Hidalgo, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kinney, Kleberg, La Salle, Maverick, Nueces, Presidio, Reeves, Starr, Terrell, Val Verde, Webb, Willacy, Zapata and Zavala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a></p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Will southern Texas negate suburban Democratic gains?" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JhOM9/12/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="676" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This is not to downplay Republicans’ gains along the border and in South Texas. Trump ultimately won 14 of these 28 counties — eight of which he flipped from 2016 — with many more counties than Starr lurching to the right: Maverick County moved 46 points to the right, Zapata County moved 38 points, Webb County moved 28 points and Hidalgo County moved 23 points. Hidalgo, with around 871,000 people, is the most populous county in the border area (edging out El Paso County’s 866,000), which made its shift toward Trump especially impactful in terms of raw vote totals. To be clear, President Biden still won the overall vote across the border and South Texas counties by 17 points, but this was about half the margin Hillary Clinton had in 2016, when she won the region by 33 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why Texas’s border region shifted so dramatically toward Republicans compared with the rest of the state has no one answer. According to Jason Villalba, the chairman and CEO of the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation and a former GOP representative in the state House, some national Democrats’ leftward shift on issues like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-climate-26908b855045d5ce7342fd01be8bcc10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clean energy and fossil fuels</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/23/defund-the-police-democrats-477609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policing</a> — including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/immigration/abolish-ice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calls to abolish or restructure</a> U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — likely turned off Hispanics along the Texas-Mexico border, who make up 85 percent of the population in those 28 counties and 23 percent of all Hispanics in the state. “Being labeled as against fossil fuels and supportive of defunding the police is not a winning message when the majority of the communities in the region are economically impacted by those two drivers,” Villalba said. “Then, layer on a cult of personality figure like Trump — and the Democrats are going to have a real problem, which they did.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Hispanic voters aren’t a monolith, and without Trump’s name on the ballot, it’s hard to tell whether Republican gains in South Texas will last. But so far, Biden isn’t polling particularly well with Hispanic voters in the state. A September poll from The Dallas Morning News/University of Texas-Tyler put Biden <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/526125317/The-Dallas-Morning-News-University-of-Texas-Tyler-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 points underwater with Hispanic voters in Texas</a>, while a separate <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University poll</a> the same month had him down 18 points among Hispanic registered voters in Texas. On top of that, Villalba said Democrats took the border region for granted in 2020, focusing much of their campaign on turning out Democrats in the state’s suburbs <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/04/joe-biden-texas-border-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather than Hispanic voters at the border</a> with Mexico. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">South Texas and the border area is also very rural, which may also have played an outsize role in why Republicans gained so much ground there. In 2020, the more rural the area, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-america-lost-and-gained-population-could-throw-democrats-a-redistricting-lifeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the better Trump tended to do</a>, and places with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large Hispanic populations were no exception</a>. This may explain in part why Trump performed so much better in more rural Starr and Maverick counties than in El Paso County, where Trump did only about 8 points better in 2020 than in 2016. This can’t explain all the differences, however, as Hidalgo and Webb counties are also more urban, yet Trump improved by more than 20 points in both. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another factor driving what we saw in 2020 could be educational attainment among Hispanics. Polarization by education has been a trend among white voters for years now, as Democrats have steadily picked up support among those with at least a four-year degree while losing support among those without one. But this trend may be affecting Latino voters, too, as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center found</a> Biden won 69 percent of Hispanics with a college degree nationally, but only 55 percent among those with some college or less. As a whole, the Texas border area isn’t as highly educated as the state’s metro areas, so this also may have played into the disparate shift to the right in many parts of the border region and South Texas. However, the share of Hispanics with a college degree in the border area is actually similar to that of the major metro areas as a whole, so this is far from clear-cut.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Democratic losses in the border areas may not frustrate their efforts to eventually turn Texas blue, primarily because the state’s four most populous metropolitan areas have trended Democratic over the past four years. These opposing trends potentially form a favorable tradeoff for Democrats because a lot more voters live in and around Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio and Austin than in the border regions. As the table below shows, those four big cities and their surroundings contributed nearly 70 percent of Texas’s 2020 presidential vote total, and all of them shifted left.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">These shifts allowed Biden to narrowly carry the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio metropolitan areas after Trump won them in 2016. It also boosted the Democrats’ edge in the Austin region. And what this did in terms of raw vote totals is telling: Compared with the 2016 election, Democrats added around 416,000 net votes — the total Biden gained over Clinton minus the total Trump gained — from these four metro areas. In contrast, Trump’s improvement in the 28 counties along the border and in South Texas produced only about 89,000 more net votes for the GOP. Although Trump was also helped by the rest of the state, which gave him about 151,000 additional net votes, the Democrats’ showing in those four big population centers outpaced what was happening outside them. This wasn’t enough to turn Texas blue — <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=48&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump still won the state</a> by about 631,000 votes — but it could point to a favorable trend for Democrats in the long run.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden didn’t make gains just in the core cities in these metropolitan areas, though. He also fared better in the suburban and exurban counties around them. In this way, Texas was a microcosm of what we saw across the nation in 2020, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-suburban-density-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats made gains in the inner and outer rings surrounding cities</a>, which proved critical to Biden’s victory. As the second-most-populous state in the country, Texas has many suburban and exurban areas, too, and there were many striking examples of red areas becoming bluer. With nearly 2 million people between them, Collin and Denton counties, north of Dallas-Fort Worth, shifted markedly to the left: Biden did about 12 points better than Clinton in each, converting places that Trump won in 2016 by 17 and 20 points, respectively, into only single-digit wins in 2020. With 609,000 inhabitants, Williamson County, which contains a small portion of northern Austin and a lot of suburban turf, even went from red to blue, going from about a 10-point Trump win in 2016 to a 1-point Biden win in 2020. Not every suburban or exurban county moved as much, but almost every county in the four big Texas metros got bluer in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In the suburban and exurban areas, there’s been a movement away from Trump and to the left. He’s really been a cancer for moderate-type voters, educated voters and voters who have typically been centrists,” Villalba said.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Democratic gains and changing demographic trends in the Texas suburbs have become such a force that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-congressional-map-could-give-a-huge-boost-to-gop-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans have opted to cede some of that turf</a> to Democrats to ensure overall GOP control. While Republicans are hoping to win over some of those South Texas seats in the U.S. House, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/senate_passed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their likely congressional map</a> intentionally draws Democratic Reps. Colin Allred of Dallas and Lizzie Pannill Fletcher of Houston into safely Democratic districts that had formerly been <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/07/congressional-districts-texas-Democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive suburban seats</a>. The GOP-controlled state legislature also <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/09/27/austin-gop-census-texas-congressional-district-redistricting-map-new/5886079001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">placed one of Texas’s new districts in Austin</a>, a Democratic stronghold, <a href="https://www.fairelectionsproject.org/gerrymandering-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pack in as many Democrats</a> as they could to help make surrounding seats redder. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With all that being said, Hispanic voters trending further to the right in the big metro areas could be an obstacle for Democrats. While Republicans made big gains in South Texas and along the border, heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in <a href="https://www.chron.com/houston/article/Five-maps-illustrating-Houston-s-racial-breakdown-12711221.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cities like Houston</a> also <a href="https://twitter.com/JMilesColeman/status/1325267759769546753" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inched toward the GOP</a>, although they still voted overwhelmingly Democratic. Should that trend continue, however, it would complicate Democrats’ ability to add more votes from the big metro areas. As such, it’s certainly in the GOP’s interest not only to make gains along the border <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/republicans-target-latino-voters-2022-community-centers-rcna2567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but also to make inroads in Hispanic communities</a> in more populous areas that still lean Democratic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After all, elections are won at the margins, and that’ll be true in Texas moving forward. Considering the magnitude of the Democratic gains in the major metropolitan areas, especially in the suburbs and exurbs, Republicans’ hold on Texas might be weakening. But depending on how electoral and demographic trends evolve, the GOP’s grip could tighten again — or slip entirely.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden’s standing with the public has deteriorated in the nine months since he has taken office. Now more Americans disapprove of his job performance than <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">approve of it</a>. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew talks about why that is, what the consequences are for Democrats and what they can do about it.

			<category>Mitch McConnell</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Sen. Mitch McConnell didn’t know what he was doing when he passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 Farm Bill</a>. The bill included his provision that legalized industrial hemp, a form of cannabis that can be made into a wide variety of products including cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating cannabis compound commonly called CBD. That part was intentional — the law quickly launched a <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cannabidiol-cbd-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-billion dollar industry</a> that put the once-obscure CBD compound into lattes, seltzers and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cvs-sell-cbd-products-800-stores-8-states-n986016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of CVS stores</a> across the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after three years it appears one of the law’s biggest impacts was entirely unintentional: It accidentally created a booming market for synthetic THC, marijuana’s primary intoxicant. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The same type of CBD that’s for sale at CVS is now being synthetically converted into THC and packaged into vape cartridges and gummy bears. Thanks to a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill, these drugs are marketed as a “<a href="https://www.themountaineer.com/news/delta-8-a-legal-high/article_82426746-eee8-11eb-8ab1-97135a0bb33d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal high</a>” and sold online and in states where marijuana remains illegal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But chemists warn that <a href="https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/natural-products/Delta-8-THC-craze-concerns/99/i31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these drugs can contain hazardous solvents</a>, acids and unknown compounds. When FiveThirtyEight legally purchased hemp-derived THC products for testing, we found illegal levels of THC and a variety of mystery compounds that could not be identified. There are no federal safety testing requirements for these products, and while hemp companies occasionally publish test results, some brands have been caught <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10519251/what-is-delta-8-thc-gummies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using fake test documents</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21203766282209.jpg" alt="A selection of delta-8 THC products" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21203766282209.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21203766282209.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21203766282209.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>The 2018 Farm Bill opened the market for online retailers to sell hemp derivatives that can get you high. <p>Wilfredo Lee / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Sales data for the unregulated hemp market is difficult to track but Delta-8-THC, the most popular of these hemp-derived intoxicants, is considered by some <a href="https://www.greenmarketreport.com/delta-8-smokable-flower-is-saving-hemp-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry</a> <a href="https://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/ingredients/delta-8-thc-saving-sagging-cbd-biz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insiders</a> to be the fastest growing product in the hemp industry. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2016-01-01%202021-09-05&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Delta%208%20thc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google search data</a> indicates that interest in these hemp-derived drugs is heavily concentrated in the American South, where conventional pot remains illegal, although hemp-derived THC is also showing up in state-regulated marijuana markets. In Washington state, regulators <a href="https://lcb.wa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/rules/Statements/Conformed%20THC%20Isomers%20Policy%20Statement%2004282021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified in April</a> that it was illegal to convert CBD into Delta-9-THC after a company admitted it was converting CBD into Delta-9-THC and selling it in the recreational marijuana market. Sales at licensed dispensaries of products containing Delta-8-THC in their titles increased over 240 percent between the second quarters of 2020 and 2021, according to the data firm Headset.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s still deep disagreement over whether any of these hemp-derived THC products are actually legal, but McConnell’s loophole has allowed these drugs to proliferate widely across the country. The hemp industry has quickly moved past selling just Delta-8-THC and is now offering an increasingly long list of synthetic cannabinoids that they can ship directly to your door. Meanwhile, cannabis insiders are warning that the country could be on the verge of a bigger public health emergency than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/health/vaping-illness-tracker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019’s vape crisis, which</a> ultimately hospitalized thousands and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8007202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed at least 68 people</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet despite the unintended consequence of the 2018 Farm Bill, Congress is not in a rush to do much about it. McConnell and his Republican co-sponsors for the Farm Bill’s hemp provision declined to comment for this story. Two of the bill’s Democratic sponsors told FiveThirtyEight that they still stand by the Farm Bill’s language.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">America has entered a new era in its scattershot experiment with legal pot. In this latest chapter, McConnell has given the country synthetic pot that nobody is regulating and almost anyone can buy.</p>

Mitch McConnell pushed for hemp derivatives to become legal in order to help hemp farmers in Kentucky. The hemp industry has been radically changed by the legalization. <p>Luke Sharrett / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2>It’s not just “THC”</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hemp might conjure images of coarse hoodies and beaded necklaces, but hemp plants can actually be made into dozens of things including <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/international/569849-rebuilding-haiti-with-bamboo-and-hemp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building materials</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/25/archives/worlds-oldest-fabric-is-now-its-newest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper</a>, <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/ingredients/article/hemp-seeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-protein food</a>, and even strong psychoactive drugs. (For his part, McConnell was very fond of <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/mitch-mcconnell-uses-hemp-pen-to-celebrate-one-year-anniversary-crops-legalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his pen made out of hemp</a>.) Hemp plants are often described as a “distant cousin” to marijuana. When McConnell was building support for hemp legalization he said it’s “an entirely separate plant” from marijuana. But this is incorrect. The line between these two types of cannabis is a legal distinction, not a scientific one. And in 2018, Congress defined hemp so broadly it included things that the layman would consider pot. </p>

Mitch McConnell and Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles were very excited about their pens made out of hemp in 2018. <p>Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The Farm Bill focused exclusively on Delta-9-THC (the type of THC common in marijuana), defining hemp as any cannabis plant with less than 0.3 percent Delta-9-THC. But Delta-9-THC is only one of over 100 active compounds found naturally in cannabis. Congress appeared to legalize all of these other compounds by including “all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers” in their definition of hemp.Many of these compounds are psychoactive and there are even different intoxicating versions of THC (called isomers), like Delta-8-THC or Delta-10-THC, which have the same chemical formula as Delta-9-THC but with the molecules slightly rearranged. Chemists can create even more types of cannabinoids synthetically in a lab.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Congress apparently didn’t realize that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As of December 2018, I had never heard of Delta-8[-THC] or Delta-10[-THC] and I can probably assure you that McConnell and others hadn’t either,” said Jonathan Miller, a former Kentucky state treasurer and a lawyer who worked closely with McConnell’s office to write the 2018 bill. Miller said the law was intentionally written so that CBD and other non-intoxicating cannabis compounds could be legally sourced from hemp. But the authors didn’t realize “how this broader language could sweep intoxicating compounds into that [Delta-9-THC] limit.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McConnell has spent years fighting for hemp legalization and, in particular, the legalization of CBD in an effort to appease his home state’s farmers. He made hemp legalization <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/us/13hemp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a campaign issue in 2013</a> and, when the Drug Enforcement Agency <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/is-dea-dazed-confused-over-industrial-hemp-90536/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked Kentucky’s farmers from growing CBD-rich</a> hemp under an earlier pilot program, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/mitch-mcconnell-hemp-115671/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">senator publicly fought the agency</a> until the DEA backed down. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When it came to writing the 2018 law, McConnell apparently didn’t want to take any chances with the DEA. His provision permanently removed hemp from the Controlled Substance Act and his broad definition of hemp extracts appears to have pulled its language from <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/14/2016-29941/establishment-of-a-new-drug-code-for-marihuana-extract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 DEA guidance</a> that the agency had used to shut down earlier attempts at selling CBD. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://goodtimes.sc/special-publications-inserts/hemp-rules-market-glut-industry-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An oversupply of CBD</a> is further accelerating the development of these drugs by providing a cheap starting material to hemp companies, which can turn CBD into a wide variety of intoxicating compounds like Delta-8-THC or Delta-10-THC. Hemp companies are effectively solving America’s CBD oversupply problem by turning CBD into THC vape pens and gummy bears.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The country’s biggest hemp companies have largely stayed out of the Delta-8-THC craze and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-02/a-pot-knockoff-sometimes-made-with-household-acid-draws-scrutiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are increasingly worried</a> about the hemp-derived intoxicant market. Cannabis advocates have spent years claiming <a href="https://norml.org/blog/2013/01/20/industrial-hemp-reform-emerging-from-marijuana-legalization-election-victories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp is not psychoactive</a>, <a href="https://drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Marijuana_Facts_Booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabis is safe</a> and <a href="https://www.mpp.org/issues/legalization/regulating-marijuana-protecting-youth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal reform will keep pot out of the hands of kids</a>. Miller said the Delta-8-THC craze has left members of Congress questioning their support for further pot reform.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This whole Delta-8 thing has unnerved all of us because we continue to make the case that hemp is not marijuana. They hear about Delta-8 and some wavering members of congress say wait a minute,” Miller said. “I used to call myself ‘Jonathan Hemp-is-not-marijuana Miller’ because that was all I talked about. The Delta-8 issue clouds that message.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Congress could shut down many of these products by passing a new law that narrows the definition of hemp, but those who pushed for the original legislation do not appear to be interested in ending the inadvertent legalization of THC — and some appear to be very comfortable with the situation it created.</p>

Rand Paul, Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, Rep. James Comer, and former Rep. Jared Polis. (Paul and Comer are Republicans; Merkley, Wyden and Polis are Democrats.) None of the sponsors agreed to an interview for this story or answered written questions. A spokesperson for Polis, who was elected governor of Colorado in 2018, said that: “The Farm Bill amendments were written broadly to make hemp accessible and support scientific research. The language has supported the growth of Colorado’s well-regulated cannabis industry.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nicole L’Esperance, a spokesperson for Wyden, blamed the unregulated THC market on cannabis prohibition and said Wyden’s solution is to legalize all forms of cannabis and force the Food And Drug Agency to regulate the industry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Any legal gray area is the result of decades of the failed system of cannabis prohibition, leaving states, farmers, businesses, consumers to navigate a patchwork of laws,” L’Esperance said in an email. “These products are on the market now and should be regulated by the FDA to protect the public health like other products, and Wyden has been pushing for the FDA to act now.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But the FDA isn’t acting. The FDA is actively <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/fda-objects-to-cbd-dietary-supplement-as-regulatory-haze-lingers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refusing to regulate</a> the CBD market and has so far only issued <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an online warning</a> that said the agency was “aware of the growing concerns surrounding Delta-8 THC products currently being sold online and in stores.” The FDA declined to comment for this story and instead directed FiveThirtyEight to the DEA. The DEA declined to comment as well, citing an ongoing rulemaking process for hemp products. The agency already clarified in <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2020/fr0821.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August of 2020</a> that they consider hemp-derived THC to be illegal, but the agency has yet to take any noticeable action against companies selling these products, according to Chelsie Spencer, a Dallas-based attorney who specializes in hemp law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The lack of enforcement is a bit unfathomable because we’ve seen the DEA make statements on Delta-8[-THC] being illegal,” Spencer said. It’s possible that the DEA is afraid a judge will rule against the agency if the agency tries to shut down a Delta-8-THC producer, according to Spencer. “Either it’s a fear of an adverse [legal] decision or that they have bigger fish to fry with the opioid crisis going on.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">State governments have scrambled to regulate these unregulated intoxicants <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/delta-8-thc-legal-many-states-some-want-ban-it-n1272270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with 14 states prohibiting Delta-8-THC</a> — which theoretically also forbids online sales in those states — and many more states considering bans or regulations for hemp-derived intoxicants.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Greg Gerdeman, a hemp entrepreneur and neuroscientist responsible for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major breakthroughs</a> in understanding cannabinoids, said it feels like some hemp companies are just trying to cash in on this legal gray area before it closes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I see some folks in the hemp industry and it feels like they’re saying, ‘Haha Congress! We gotcha. You said something you didn’t understand or mean but by goodness we are going to claim that it is our right to make this,’” Gerdeman said.</p>



<hr><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1152" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1173401350.jpg" alt="A vape store" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1173401350.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1173401350.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1173401350.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Public health experts are concerned that synthetic THC could cause a public health emergency like the vaping crisis a few years ago. <p>Jovelle Tamayo / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2>“Delta-8 on steroids”</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Purchasing Delta-8-THC was the easiest drug deal I have ever made — far easier than buying legal marijuana. A quick Google search found the website “Bearly Legal Hemp Co,” which advertises itself with a bear smoking a cigarette surrounded by the motto “Can’t believe its [sic] not weed.” I browsed through an online catalog of Delta-8-THC products and bought a bag of gummy bears, a pack of pre-rolled Delta-8 joints, and a vape cartridge of Delta-8-THC-O acetate, a new cannabinoid that the website promised could be “considered Delta-8 on steroids.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">THC-O, as it is more commonly called, represents a new class of molecules for the hemp industry. When hemp companies make Delta-8 THC, they are using lab synthesis to replicate a compound naturally produced by cannabis (although only found in extremely small quantities). But Delta-8-THC-O acetate is a lab-designed molecule that is never found in nature. Very little is known about THC-O’s effects but its production process is similar to how morphine is “acetylated” into heroin. In both heroin and THC-O, a chemist synthetically modifies the drug so it can deliver a stronger high. Bearly Legal warned customers to “Tread Lightly!” with this new cannabinoid because it’s “highly potent.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="630" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BearlyLegal.jpg" alt="A graphic of THC Vape products sold by Bearly Legal Hemp" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BearlyLegal.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BearlyLegal.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BearlyLegal.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Bearly Legal Hemp sells a variety of THC vape products, including those derived from CBD. <p>Bearly Legal Hemp</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">After selecting my products, the website sent me to an age verification process where I used my laptop’s camera to take a photo of my face and a photo of my ID card before entering my credit card to pay for the drugs. A week later the U.S. Postal Service delivered the hemp intoxicants to my door with no identification check required.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I sent the three products to KCA Labs, a Kentucky laboratory that is considered a national leader in testing hemp-derived products. Their test results showed that the Delta-8 I bought could get someone high, but it would come laced with compounds so mysterious a lab couldn’t identify them.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KCA Labs ran two tests on each product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The gummies had less than 0.3 percent Delta-9-THC (the federal limit for hemp), but the hemp pre-rolled joints contained 1.14 percent Delta-9-THC and the THC-O acetate cartridge contained 0.62 percent Delta-9-THC, both over the federal legal limit. The THC-O acetate also contained heptane, a toxic industrial solvent, and lead, but both were detected at low levels and below the legal limit for marijuana products in California’s regulated market, which is <a href="https://www.thompsoncoburn.com/insights/blogs/tracking-cannabis/post/2018-10-04/a-state-by-state-ranking-of-cannabis-regulations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered an authority</a> on marijuana safety standards.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bearly Legal did not respond to multiple requests for comment from FiveThirtyEight.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All three of the products also contained compounds that could not be identified by KCA Labs. Richard Sams, KCA’s scientific director who has a Ph.D. in pharmaceutical sciences, said these unknown compounds are likely synthetic cannabinoids that are created as byproducts during the CBD conversion process. “These side products are being produced in all of these reactions,” Sams said. No matter how reputable the company you’re buying your Delta-8 from, there’s likely to be some unknown compounds that come along with it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kyle Boyar, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, said the chemistry behind converting CBD to THC is very well understood but executing these reactions safely requires expertise in synthetic chemistry, something many hemp companies lack.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s well established how it works but the problem is that a lot of people who are doing this are not trained on synthesis, they are just getting information off the internet and trying it to see if it works. It’s a bit worrisome and a little bit scary,” Boyar said. “It really does seem like a cash grab for a lot of people right now because of the lack of oversight.”</p>

These types of synthetic cannabinoids were <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MuqLHOJxu5oY10cAuWclcXYdMWkHt--S/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first invented by the pharmaceutical industry</a> and can react with our internal cannabinoid receptors in unnaturally strong ways. Synthetic cannabinoids are already a common street drug, sold under names like Spice or K2, that send <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7874647/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of people to the hospital</a> every year and have killed <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26567470/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 26 people</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gerdeman, the cannabis scientist and hemp entrepreneur, said Delta-8-THC by itself is likely a very safe compound but he said it’s possible that hemp chemists “monkeying around in an unregulated laboratory” could accidentally create a dangerous synthetic cannabinoid without realizing it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A mountain of rigorous mainstream pre-clinical scientific research has taught us that Delta-9-THC is in general a very safe molecule,” Gerdeman said. “But then the Spice/K2 experience … taught us that just because a drug acts at a cannabinoid receptor doesn’t mean it’s safe.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Synthetic cannabinoids have already shown up in the hemp market. In 2019, researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379073818307047?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that four out of nine vape cartridges purchased from <a href="http://www.diamondcbd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.DiamondCBD.com</a> contained 5F-ADB, a dangerous synthetic molecule that mimics cannabinoids and is already an illegal substance at the federal level. The company’s CEO told <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cbd/dangerous-chemicals-found-in-popular-cbd-products-diamond-cbd-5f-adb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a> that DiamondCBD was going to retest all of its products after the study was published and recall any found to contain such compounds. An <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ut-state-wire-tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-cbd-marijuana-7b452f4af90b4620ab0ff0eb2cca62cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP News investigation</a> in 2019 found even more brands selling CBD vape cartridges with synthetic cannabinoids.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The industry’s new THC-O products could also lead to the same type of lung damage identified during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/health/vaping-marijuana-ecigarettes-sickness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019-20 vape crisis</a>, according to Brad Douglass, a vice president of regulatory affairs for The Werc Shop, a multi-state cannabis processor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that a vape additive called vitamin E acetate was “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#what-we-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly linked</a>” to the lung damage and Douglass said THC-O could create the same type of lung damage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The belief is that the problem with vitamin E acetate in vape products is that at certain temperatures vitamin E degrades into ketenes, which are akin to a chemical warfare agent with toxic and corrosive gas,” Douglass said. “The same sort of breakdown can occur with THC-O acetate at very high temperatures.”</p>



<hr><h2>The FDA can fix it. Will it?</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2018 Farm Bill explicitly gave the FDA authority over hemp regulations, but so far the agency has refused to even regulate dietary CBD products, let alone drugs like Delta-8-THC or Delta-8-THC-O acetate that are produced from converted CBD, claiming that federal law prevents them from doing so. That has created the current situation, where new forms of THC are being sold around the country with no assurance that these new synthetic drugs are free of dangerous solvents or byproducts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Douglass said that’s a shame, because the FDA clearly has the scientific experts and regulatory ability to regulate hemp derivatives. The FDA has a long history of regulating synthetic drugs — for example, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/03/13/289750754/wake-up-and-smell-the-caffeine-its-a-powerful-drug" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of caffeine</a> found in energy drinks and sodas is produced synthetically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If the FDA were serious about the mandate to regulate hemp products then they could clear up a lot of this chemistry pretty easily,” Douglass said. That’s what the scientists at the FDA are supposed to be good at — examining complicated science and determining what is dangerous and what is not. “There’s been other times that the FDA has dealt with the risks and complexities involved with synthesis.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sens. Wyden, Paul and Merkley introduced legislation in May that would <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Hemp%20Access%20and%20Consumer%20Safety%20Act%20of%202021%20Bill%20Text.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">force the FDA</a> to regulate CBD and hemp-derivative products like Delta-8. But the law is focused on regulating, not ending, the Delta-8 market — it would not change the broad definition of hemp that was included in the 2018 bill. </p>

That surplus has also created a market for synthetic THC. <p>Derek Davis / Portland Portland Press Herald via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Other countries have mostly avoided the pitfalls of America’s commercialize first, regulate second approach to industrial hemp. Europe’s hemp legalization <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32013R1307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlawed all THC</a> over <a href="https://hemptoday.net/european-parliament-signs-off-on-raising-eu-thc-limit-to-0-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0.3 percent</a>, not just Delta-9-THC, and didn’t include McConnell’s derivatives and extracts language, which appears to have limited the hemp intoxicant industry. And when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/07/cbd-will-go-on-sale-in-australia-but-first-manufacturers-will-have-to-prove-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australia legalized CBD earlier this year</a>, the country required that all CBD products must first be approved by its version of the FDA before they can be sold, although the agency has yet to approve any CBD products.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unsurprisingly, individual states are taking the lead in regulating hemp while the FDA looks the other way. Oregon’s state legislature <a href="https://harrisbricken.com/cannalawblog/oregons-new-thc-in-milligrams-limit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently passed a law</a> that is gaining support among hemp advocates as a model way to regulate cannabinoids. The law creates a new class of “adult-use cannabis” products for anything that contains THC, its isomers, or “any artificially derived cannabinoid that is reasonably determined to have an intoxicating effect.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the current patchwork of state laws has allowed hemp companies to make money selling unregulated and intoxicating drugs like the one FiveThirtyEight purchased. Hemp processors continue to have access to cheap materials to make hemp intoxicants with the price of CBD isolate remaining at around $500 a kilo in August of this year, down from over $4,400 in August 2019, according to Hemp Benchmarks. New cannabinoids continue to proliferate in the market.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In August, Bearly Legal Hemp Co., the website FiveThirtyEight procured Delta-8-THC from, released a cannabinoid they call HHC. The website compares HHC directly to THC and says it is “legal in states that have banned Delta-8.” The website goes on to say that “Some people claim it gives them the same euphoric feeling, pain-fighting, and anti nausea/vomiting effects that THC does. Some just enjoy the Buzz :).”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That emoticon is what passes for quality control in the unregulated Delta-8-THC market. The incredible complexity of regulating the cannabis plant is being determined by lawyers and politicians, not the scientists who actually know what is behind these products. That means easier highs for many Americans, but also a designer drug market full of mysterious compounds and clear potential health risks to consumers. Is that what D.C. wants?</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Election Day 2021 is only about two weeks away, and the big race to watch is undoubtedly Virginia’s gubernatorial contest. A <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still-somewhat purple state with a Democratic lean in recent presidential elections</a>, Virginia <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/can-you-be-my-bellwether" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be viewed</a> by many as a bellwether for the 2022 midterms, and the race is already proving to be a testing ground for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-republican-might-win-in-virginias-governor-race-and-how-new-jerseys-race-could-get-tighter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the big national issues</a> that could very well influence elections next year, including COVID-19 policies, what should be in taught in schools and the economy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Terry McAuliffe, a former governor, aims to regain his old job and continue a 13-election winning streak for Democrats in Virginia statewide races since 2012,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President and U.S. Senate in 2012; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2013; U.S. Senate in 2014; president in 2016; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2017; U.S. Senate in 2018; and president and U.S. Senate in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> while Glenn Youngkin hopes to break that run and deliver a gubernatorial election victory to the GOP for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/us/04vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first time since 2009</a>. And according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Virginia polling average</a>, it really is either candidate’s race to win. McAuliffe leads by only a few percentage points, suggesting a close, competitive race that, while somewhat likelier to result in a Democratic victory, could go either way.</p>

The poll also found that Republicans benefited from <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s underwater approval rating</a>, including dissatisfaction toward the president <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among independent voters</a>. To be sure, campaign polls like this one <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to overstate how well the candidate is performing by 4 to 5 points</a>, but recent public polling does suggest it’s a close race, and those surveys also show that Biden might be a drag on the Democratic ticket. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A survey conducted Oct. 4-11 by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/virginia-governor-race-vaccine-economy-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov</a>, for instance, found McAuliffe leading among likely voters by 3 points, 50 percent to 47 percent. The poll also found Biden’s approval rating at 48 percent and his disapproval rating at 52 percent in Virginia. Similarly, an <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/virginia-2021-dead-heat-in-governor-and-attorney-general-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College poll</a> from earlier this month also found Biden’s ratings underwater in the commonwealth, at 45 percent approval versus 48 percent disapproval. That poll also found McAuliffe and Youngkin running neck and neck at 49 percent, the Republican’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best recent public survey</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Together, the Virginia numbers <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-has-bidens-approval-rating-gotten-so-low-so-quickly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">echo Biden’s decline in national approval polling</a> and suggest his standing in Virginia has declined meaningfully since <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his 10-point victory over then-President Donald Trump</a> last November, which has produced an electoral environment that could be friendly enough for the GOP to win the governorship.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And given the narrow margins in the polls, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrsts-virginia-governor/2021/09/29/47f3099a-2135-11ec-9309-b743b79abc59_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are concerned</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/10/politics/terry-mcauliffe-congress-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including McAuliffe</a>, who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcauliffe-calls-biden-unpopular-in-virginia-amid-bellwether-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently told a group of Democrats</a> in a teleconference that the campaign had to “plow through” the “headwinds from Washington” because of the president’s unpopularity in Virginia. On the one hand, McAuliffe was in this situation before and came out on top. He won in 2013 when another Democratic president, Barack Obama, <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had an approval rating</a> in the mid-40s and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia was redder</a> than it is now. (McAuliffe’s 2013 win actually <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-surprisingly-dramatic-terry-ken-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked the first victory</a> for the president’s party in a Virginia gubernatorial election since 1973). On the other hand, Youngkin may be a more formidable foe than McAuliffe’s 2013 opponent, then-Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2013/11/06/terry-mcauliffe-three-reasons-why-he-is-the-new-governor-elect-of-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy to portray as a right-wing ideologue</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-trounces-cuccinelli-in-late-donations-in-virginia-governors-race/2013/10/31/f0749b7a-423a-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailed McAuliffe badly in fundraising</a>. By comparison, Youngkin <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/virginia-republicans-just-gave-themselves-a-chance-to-win-back-the-governorship/2021/05/11/574c545a-b281-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t have a track record to attack</a> — he’s never held office — and as a former finance executive, he also has a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governors-race-financial-disclosures/2021/07/01/b697b70e-da9c-11eb-9bbb-37c30dcf9363_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast amount of personal wealth</a> to spend on the race, which <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/09/virginia-governors-race-tightens-mcauliffe-youngkin-report-big-fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has helped him</a> slightly outpace McAuliffe <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/governor/elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in overall fundraising</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-democrats-worried-virginia-gubernatorial-race-silver-80379206</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">In terms of the issues, McAuliffe <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/23/virginia-governor-race-vaccines-democrats-513705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been hammering</a> Youngkin over his opposition to a COVID-19 vaccine mandate, and that CBS News/YouGov poll suggests this could be a winning issue for the Democrat: 54 percent of likely voters backed Virginia businesses requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees, and more voters (46 percent) thought McAuliffe would handle vaccines better than Youngkin (41 percent). Abortion could also be an important issue for McAuliffe, following the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court’s decision to allow a restrictive Texas abortion law</a> to go into effect, as almost 60 percent of Virginia voters in both the CBS News/YouGov and Emerson College polls said that abortion should always be legal or legal with some restrictions. The issue could especially motivate the Democratic base, as Democrats across the country <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-may-now-motivate-democrats-more-than-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are now more likely than Republicans to say the issue</a> is “very important” to them. However, Virginians in the CBS News/YouGov survey thought Youngkin would create more jobs than McAuliffe (45 percent to 41 percent) and do more to reduce violent crime (45 percent to 35 percent). That latter advantage stands out, as Youngkin <a href="https://www.loudountimes.com/news/loudoun-sheriff-in-latest-youngkin-ad-claims-mcauliffe-s-policies-won-t-make-virginia-safe/article_70f9bbae-0c31-11ec-8bdd-bf95853e32db.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tried to portray McAuliffe</a> as incapable of keeping Virginians safe. Additionally, Youngkin has attacked McAuliffe over school curricula and parents’ control of their children’s education, including by seizing on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/07/politics/glenn-youngkin-parental-rights-education-strategy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a clip of McAuliffe at a debate</a> in late September where he said, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” Emerson College’s poll found 52 percent of voters felt parents should have more influence on school curricula than school boards, compared with 33 percent who prioritized school boards.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the polls could be overselling the GOP’s chances, like they did in 2017 when Republican Ed Gillespie trailed Democrat Ralph Northam <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2017/governor/va/virginia_governor_gillespie_vs_northam-6197.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by about 3 points going into the election</a> — similar to where Youngkin is now — but ended up <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2017&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing by 9 points</a>. That’s impossible to say with any certainty, as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-updated-our-pollster-ratings-ahead-of-the-2020-general-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direction of polling error is inconsistent</a> from one cycle to the next. But polls that model higher turnout, such as the CBS News/YouGov survey, which found that McAuliffe led Youngkin by 8 points instead of 3 points in a high-turnout situation, suggest Democrats could perform better than expected if pollsters are underestimating turnout. Higher-than-expected turnout might be in play, too, considering the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2018-midterms-in-4-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredibly high levels</a> of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/turnout-soared-in-2020-as-nearly-two-thirds-of-eligible-u-s-voters-cast-ballots-for-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participation in recent elections</a> and Virginia’s <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/how-virginia-made-voting-easier-and-fairer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push in the past couple of years</a> to make <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/elections/new-virginia-voting-laws-take-effect-make-voting-easier-more-accessible/291-331d6a27-3898-40e3-af91-bf83d7bfde1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting more accessible</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/08/23/democrats-sweat-turnout-disaster-in-california-without-trump-to-run-against-1390415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats had concerns</a> about turnout in California’s gubernatorial recall election earlier this year, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those worries proved unfounded</a> (although Virginia doesn’t mail a ballot to every voter like California did).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, it’s probably a mistake to equate 2021 with 2017. Four years ago, Virginia’s gubernatorial contest happened while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular Republican occupied the White House</a>, which helped boost Democrats. Now, a somewhat unpopular Democratic president could help Republicans. Consider that polls suggest that Republicans have a somewhat more energized base: 50 percent of likely Youngkin voters told CBS/YouGov they were “very enthusiastic” to vote, compared to 44 percent of McAuliffe backers, and a <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2021-10-08.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Newport University</a> survey of likely voters conducted in late September and early October also found more Republicans were “very enthusiastic” to vote (61 percent) than Democrats (55 percent). </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, voters can still cast a ballot regardless of how enthusiastic they are, but these findings do align with the expectation that we’ll see some degree of “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differential turnout</a>” in the election, or where voters from the party not in the White House are more likely to show up in a non-presidential election than those from the president’s party. Couple this with Youngkin’s advantage among independents — Youngkin led by 6 to 9 points among independents in those polls from CBS News/YouGov, Emerson College and Christopher Newport University — and it could be enough for a Youngkin win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Historically, Virginia hasn’t been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-virginia-governors-race-is-not-a-good-political-barometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an especially good barometer of the overall national environment</a>, but given how close the race currently is, the media and the parties will probably react strongly to whatever the result is: A Democratic win will be a sign that Democrats aren’t completely up a creek without a paddle in 2022, while a GOP victory will be a loud klaxon signaling a red wave next year. The truth is more complicated, of course, as one election should never be used as a benchmark on its own, but the spotlight will shine brightly on Virginia’s result nevertheless.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>According to an <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/the-public-is-highly-concerned-about-cyber-attacks-on-the-united-states/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-public-is-highly-concerned-about-cyber-attacks-on-the-united-states">AP-NORC poll</a> conducted last month, two-thirds of Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about cyber attacks on national security and defense systems. And Americans seem to be most concerned by the threats that China and Russia pose: 73 percent of Americans thought the Chinese government was a big threat to the cybersecurity of the U.S. government, while 72 percent thought the Russian government was a big threat. By contrast, 53 percent said groups not affiliated with a foreign government posed a big threat to the U.S. government’s cybersecurity. </li><li>Just over a year before the 2022 midterm elections, 45 percent of registered voters say they are “extremely” enthusiastic (26 percent) or “very” enthusiastic (19 percent) to cast their ballots, per a recent <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/13064013/2110042_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a>. Those who voted for Republican House candidates in the 2018 midterms were slightly more likely to be extremely enthusiastic about voting in 2022 (34 percent) compared to voters who cast their ballots for Democratic House candidates in 2018 (29 percent). This 5-point gap isn’t all that big, but it does line up with research we cited earlier that suggests voters from the party not in the White House are often more motivated to vote in a non-presidential election.</li><li>Earlier this year, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">leaked internal documents to the Wall Street Journal</a> that showed Facebook was aware of negative effects it had on users as well as the negative effects of Instagram on teenage girls’ mental health. In <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/ABCNews/live-updates/live-updates-Facebook/?id=80401245">congressional testimony</a> this month, Haugen claimed Facebook knew about these harmful effects and did nothing about it. In light of this leak and testimony, 59 percent of Americans said they believed Haugen’s claims were true, per a <a href="https://leger360.com/surveys/legers-north-american-tracker-october-13-2021/">Leger/The Canadian Press survey</a>, although 24 percent said they hadn’t heard of the leak.</li><li>School mask mandates <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-school-districts-masks-place-defiance-governor-ban/story?id=80533872">continue to be hotly debated</a> between school districts, lawmakers and parents, sometimes resulting in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/back-to-school-live-updates/2021/08/20/1028841279/mask-mandates-school-protests-teachers">violent altercations</a>. Last week, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-addresses-violent-threats-against-school-officials-and-teachers">directed the FBI and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices</a> to investigate the harassment and threats of violence against school board members and teachers. It’s possible, though, that some Americans view this investigation as government overreach. According to a <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/coronavirus/parent_school_protests_protected_by_first_amendment_most_voters_agree">recent Rasmussen Reports survey</a>, 47 percent of likely voters said they opposed a federal investigation, with 39 percent “strongly” opposed and 8 percent “somewhat” opposed.</li><li>From Oct. 6 to Oct. 12, an average of <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#new-hospital-admissions">6,659 new COVID-19 patients</a> were admitted to a hospital in the United States, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This continued stream of COVID-19 patients has strained hospitals, and there is now a looming shortage of health-care workers in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/short-staffed-hospitals-battling-covid-surge-opting-staff/story?id=79360422">states like Florida, Arkansas, Texas and Alabama</a>. In a <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/04064018/2109015_crosstabs_MC_HEALTH_HEALTHCARE_WORKERS_Health_Care_Workers_v2_CC.pdf">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted in early September, 41 percent of health-care workers said shortages of workers within some health-care professions have had a “major” impact on them and their jobs, and a majority of health-care workers (51 percent) said their mental health had worsened since the pandemic spread to the United States. Yet still, 69 percent of health-care workers said they hadn’t considered leaving their job.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden Approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Local news is disappearing in towns across the country. From 2008 to 2019, the percentage of people who said they got their news from local papers every day <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1663/media-use-evaluation.aspx">fell by more than half</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It took a small town chiropractor named Charles Brown to help vaccinate millions of kids for decades to come — all because he didn’t want to vaccinate his own.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was 1979 in Houston, Mississippi, and Brown needed to enroll his 6-year-old son in school. But state law required the boy to be vaccinated against certain diseases, and Brown didn’t want to vaccinate his son. At the time, Mississippi had two exceptions to this law: medical exemption, for kids who had a medical condition that prevented them from receiving certain shots, and a religious exemption, but only for religious groups whose doctrines explicitly prohibit vaccination, such as Christian Scientists. Brown’s son wasn’t eligible for either exemption. So Brown sued.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brown <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/mississippi/supreme-court/1979/51553-0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued that</a> by limiting the exemption to only certain religious groups, the law violated his First Amendment rights and ought to be expanded to include <em>any</em> religion. (The Browns were Christian, but not a sect approved for a medical exemption.) The case made it to the state Supreme Court where it spectacularly backfired. Rather than expand the religious exemption, the justices argued that having the exemption at all was a violation of the 14th Amendment because it put the rights of certain religious parents over the rights of other parents. The state court struck down the exemption altogether. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that decision, <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi became just the second state</a> (after West Virginia) not to offer religious or personal belief exemptions to <a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/index.cfm/14,2029,71,pdf/MS_School_Immunization_Requirements_-_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its child vaccination mandate</a>. Mississippi now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2015/01/30/mississippi-yes-mississippi-has-the-nations-best-child-vaccination-rate-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently</a> has the country’s highest rates of vaccination among children entering school. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/us-unprepared-covid-fda-chief-80459329</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Mississippi’s childhood immunization rates are a sharp contrast to its COVID-19 vaccination numbers. As of Thursday, 44.5 percent of eligible Mississippians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html?.?mc=aud_dev&amp;ad-keywords=auddevgate&amp;gclsrc=ds&amp;gclsrc=ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are fully vaccinated</a>, making it 46th in the nation. In fact, Mississippi’s overall vaccination record — outside of kindergarteners — isn’t great: The <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2019/10/08/mississippi-first-in-school-age-vaccines-lags-in-immunization-rates-for-teens-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state ranks much lower</a> when it comes to vaccine rates for toddlers and teens, as the vaccination requirement only applies to students entering school for the first time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s natural to wonder, then, whether Mississippi — and other vaccine-hesitant states — will expand their mandates to include the COVID-19 vaccine once it’s approved for kids as young as 5 years old. School mandates are one of the few tools states have to enforce vaccination, and <a href="http://www.pkids.org/immunizations/immunization_mandates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’re effective</a>. Other jurisdictions are already considering, or have already enacted, such a mandate: California has <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/california-is-mandating-covid-vaccines-for-kids-will-other-states-follow/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> plans to make the COVID-19 shot mandatory for grade school attendance, and <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/10/06/cambridge-public-schools-covid-19-vaccine-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school districts</a> across the country have <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/will-more-schools-follow-los-angeles-lead-and-require-covid-19-vaccination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it a requirement</a> for extracurricular activities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But adding COVID-19 shots to existing school mandates is not without risk. If an unpopular and highly politicized vaccine is added to the list, those opposed may begin to challenge all vaccine requirements. It’s already happening in other states, to some extent. In Ohio, statehouse Republicans <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/continuing-coverage/coronavirus/vaccinating-ohio/ohio-house-holds-hearing-on-controversial-bill-that-would-essentially-ban-mandates-on-all-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a bill that would ban all vaccine mandates</a>, of any kind, for any vaccine, though it was never voted out of committee. And in Tennessee, Republican lawmakers pressured the state department of health into <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/07/23/tennessee-restart-vaccine-outreach-paused-amid-gop-pressure/8043482002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily halting vaccine outreach</a> to minors for any shot, not just the COVID-19 jab. It’s an idea that may be gaining popularity among Republican voters, too. The Economist/YouGov have historically surveyed Americans on whether or not they think “parents should be required to have their children vaccinated against infectious diseases.” In the past, and as recently as last year, the majority of both Republicans and Democrats answered yes, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/13/slippery-slope-gops-anti-vaccine-mandate-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a new poll</a> released yesterday, only 46 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement. This fight pits two very serious public health considerations against one another: Either keep the COVID-19 vaccine off the school mandate and risk leaving millions of children and communities at greater risk of the virus, or add it and risk the entire vaccine schedule falling under attack.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When it comes to childhood immunization, you simply can’t beat the Magnolia State. During the 2019-2020 school year, <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/100473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 99 percent of Mississippi kindergarteners</a> were fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks kindergarten vaccination rates in every state for the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) and chickenpox vaccines. While childhood vaccination rates in the U.S. are generally high, Mississippi is exceptional — it has a more than 99 percent coverage rate for all three shots. Other state rates for kindergarteners ranged as low as 84 percent (for the DTaP vaccine in Indiana). The second-highest rate (in West Virginia, also for DTaP) was 98.8 percent. Childhood vaccine mandates have always been political, but they have typically not been partisan. The modern anti-vax movement has prompted fights surrounding the mandates and their exemptions, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-arent-new-to-the-anti-vaxx-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I’ve previously reported</a>, the anti-vax movement has long been a bipartisan affair. As a result, childhood vaccination rates don’t fall along partisan lines <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the way COVID-19 vaccination rates do</a> — red states are just as likely to have high childhood immunization rates as blue ones. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Like most states, Mississippi has had its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/us/mississippi-a-leader-on-vaccination-rates-stands-by-strict-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share of pushback</a> from anti-vaccine groups over the mandate (and in particular its lack of exemptions). But these efforts <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t amounted to much</a> beyond a few proposed bills that died in committee. Among the general public, the mandate has largely been tolerated as a fact of life, according to James Colgrove, a sociomedical science professor at Columbia University who studies public health policy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I haven’t found evidence that there was any widespread resistance,” Colgrove said. “The evidence we have for its acceptance is mostly negative evidence: the absence of lawsuits and controversy.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When measles outbreaks have occurred in recent years, <a href="https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2019/may/06/mississippi-evades-measles-activists-want-vaccine-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi has been spared</a> due to its high vaccination rates, even when outbreaks hit neighboring states. These outbreaks remind the public of just what vaccines protect them from and can be helpful for passing or upholding vaccine law. Consider California, which leveraged a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measles outbreak</a> to <a href="https://www.kqed.org/stateofhealth/41751/bill-ending-vaccine-exemptions-passes-california-senate-moves-to-governors-desk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do away with</a> its personal belief/religious exemption in 2015.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Mississippi has not embraced the COVID-19 vaccine in the same way. Government agencies and nonprofits have worked together to reduce barriers to accessing the vaccine — efforts that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mississippi-s-black-communities-turned-around-covid-rates-next-vaccines-n1268693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped the state close</a> its early racial gap. But nearly half the state’s eligible population remains unvaccinated, and the politicization of the pandemic has undoubtedly played a role. It’s reductive to suggest all of the vaccine hesitancy is simply due to Mississippi being a red state (Republicans are less likely than Democrats to be vaccinated for COVID-19), but there is a correlation: Counties with a higher voter share for Trump have some of the lowest vaccination rates in the state. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="The redder a Mississippi county gets, the lower its vaccination rate tends to be" aria-label="chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LBtEZ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="560" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“We often get reduced to backwoods, ignorant people who don’t know how to think. It’s much more nuanced than that,” said David Buys, the state health specialist at Mississippi State University Extension. “We have a lot of rugged individualism that serves us quite well. That’s not altogether bad. We want people to be critical thinkers. In this case, we do want people to rely a little bit more on the expertise of our public health officials.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That politicized tension makes the notion of mandating a COVID-19 vaccine for all school kids, once it’s available, much less likely in the state. Though <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ms/title-41-public-health/ms-code-sect-41-23-37.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state law grants authority</a> to the State Health Officer to specify which vaccines are required to enroll in school, new shots are rarely added. The most recent shot, for chickenpox, <a href="https://www.wlox.com/story/875654/chickenpox-vaccine-mandatory/#:~:text=Mississippi%20children%20entering%20daycare%20and,to%20enter%20preschool%20or%20kindergarten." target="_blank" rel="noopener">was added by the state department of health in 2002</a>, with little fanfare. But the vaccine against HPV — another <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/cancer-articles/public-perception-of-scientific-uncertainty-is-linked-to-hpv-vaccine-policy-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicized vaccine</a> — was never added (this is <a href="https://www.immunize.org/laws/hpv.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">true for most states</a>), despite it being <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended</a> by the CDC. The state department of health refused to answer a request for comment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates in Mississippi, whatever the means, will undeniably reduce the spread of the virus, but this vaccine is different from the ones currently required for school children. Aside from the politicization, COVID-19 is not a disease that primarily impacts kids the way measles, mumps, or pertussis do. Though the vaccine reduces the risk of infection, the risk of a severe infection or death from COVID-19 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/briefing/covid-age-risk-infection-vaccine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is already quite low for children</a>. This would make adding it to the school mandate an even harder sell in a state resistant to the jab. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And then there’s the concern that drawing attention to a law can have unintended consequences. (Just ask Charles Brown.) Given the COVID-19 vaccine’s heightened politicization, adding it to a school mandate could draw unwanted attention to the other mandated vaccines, and risk politicizing those as well. Some public health experts <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-fight-gottlieb-face-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have even warned against</a> including the COVID-19 vaccine in school mandates for this precise reason.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Health officers are creatures of the state and the health officer is probably keenly aware that trying to go that route could lead to political backlash,” said Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, a vaccine law expert at the University of California, Hastings. “I’d be surprised if, in a state with this level of hesitancy, this would happen.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mississippi isn’t alone in facing down this dilemma. As COVID-19 vaccines gain approval for kids aged 5 to 11 — which <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-tells-states-prepare-covid-vaccinations-young-children-n1281384" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’re expected to</a> in the coming weeks — every state will need to grapple with whether or not existing school mandates ought to include COVID-19, or if the risk of drawing negative attention is too great. As Brown learned in his crusade to change the religious exemption, sometimes efforts to alter a law can wind up destroying it altogether.</p>

But following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in early September <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to block Texas’s new law</a> banning most abortions once an ultrasound can detect cardiac activity, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/02/republicans-abortion-texas-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/21/republicans-will-rue-texas-abortion-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/texas-abortion-law-even-more-absurd-practice/620265/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that Democrats may become more motivated by reproductive rights. As one Republican pollster recently told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-texas-laws-election-2020-7f78f6ca27a40bb68b99947a4e63e76a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press</a>, “It is going to be a very motivating issue for women who haven’t typically been single-issue pro-choice voters.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tracking data from <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/economist/survey-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> seems to support this viewpoint. In each weekly survey since February, respondents were asked about the importance of abortion, and as we see in the chart below, the issue has become increasingly more important to Democrats and less important to Republicans ever since.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="966" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tesler.ABORTION-PUBLIC-OPINION.1013-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tesler.ABORTION-PUBLIC-OPINION.1013-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tesler.ABORTION-PUBLIC-OPINION.1013-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tesler.ABORTION-PUBLIC-OPINION.1013-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Throughout most of 2021, Trump voters were actually more likely than Biden voters to say that abortion is a “very important” issue to them. That matched the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long history</a> of abortion opponents rating the issue as more important than its proponents. But, as the chart above shows, this pattern was dramatically reversed after Texas’s abortion ban went into effect. Averaged across the five weekly surveys conducted by The Economist/YouGov since then, 51 percent of Biden backers rated abortion as a very important issue compared with just 39 percent of Trump supporters. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/07/women-abortion-texas-law-top-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult’s polling</a> shows that the share of Democratic women who said issues such as abortion, contraception and equal pay are central when voting for federal office nearly doubled immediately after Texas’s ban.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/texas-abortion-ban-rest-country-fivethirtyeight-79824406</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats were also almost twice as likely as Republicans to have heard “a lot” about new restrictive abortion laws in both Texas and Mississippi (49 percent vs. 26 percent, respectively in an <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/j46zs8picp/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oct. 3-5 Economist/YouGov poll</a>). This is likely due to how little airtime Texas’s law has gotten both <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/why-right-so-quiet-about-texass-abortion-law/619991/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among Republican politicians</a> and conservative media outlets like Fox News. Consider that Fox News <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=abortion&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20210901000000&amp;edt=20210930235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fdn=raw&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> “abortion” 392 times in September, compared with 1,326 and 2,969 respective mentions on CNN and MSNBC.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran a search of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC coverage from Sept. 1 to Sept. 30 in the Television News Archive using the GDELT 2.0 TV API. The database splits daily news footage into 15-second clips, and returned those that contained a mention of our search query (“abortion”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> Republican politicians and conservative media organizations are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/17/why-republicans-scared-texas-abortion-512554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly fearful</a> of the potential backlash from the <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_092021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular Texas law</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that Democrats are both more likely to say abortion is important to them and to have heard a lot about Texas’s law dovetails nicely with a familiar pattern in public opinion research: Americans whose policy commitments are threatened respond by increasingly prioritizing those issues. This has happened <a href="https://themonkeycage.org/2013/02/who-cares-about-budget-deficits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple times</a> in recent decades during high-profile public policy debates and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-015-9317-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing research</a> even suggests that policy threats can mobilize election turnout.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We saw a similar phenomenon during former President Donald Trump administration’s efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In a poll conducted by <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/0c8pv9xegd/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> one week before the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton voters and Trump voters were equally likely to say that health care was a “very important” issue (76 percent and 75 percent, respectively). But as Trump and the Republican majority in Congress pushed to repeal Obamacare during the first year of his presidency, Democrats and Republicans increasingly diverged over the issue’s importance. By the <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/blvmt31w4l/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of April 2017</a>, health care was a very important issue among 85 percent of Clinton voters versus just 67 percent of Trump supporters. This is telling because Democratic voters went on to prioritize health care as their <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/midterm-exit-polls-2018-n932516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most important issue in the 2018 midterms elections</a>, with Democrats more than <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-election-tracking-poll-health-care-in-the-2018-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as likely as Republicans</a> to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether Democrats continue prioritizing abortion will inevitably depend in large part on how the Supreme Court rules next year on the constitutionality of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mississippi-abortion-clinic-braces-supreme-court-showdown-roe/story?id=80266499" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Missississipi statute that bars most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy</a>. It also remains to be seen how further restrictions on reproductive rights will affect the 2022 midterms — threats to the health care status quo <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09615-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped Democrats in 2018</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X11433768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurt them back in 2010</a>. But regardless of how the court rules, the public’s strongly held views about abortion make it an unusually powerful issue in American politics — one that voters <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3694284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have even switched parties over in the past</a>. Any increased importance of abortion to Democratic voters, then, will likely be a boon to the party’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely chances</a> of retaining its slim congressional majorities after the 2022 midterm elections.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The number of U.S. representatives not seeking reelection is now up to 19. Since <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-all-those-house-retirements-mean-for-democrats-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our last update</a>, GOP Rep. Anthony Gonzalez bowed out in the face of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-will-survive-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican revolt in his district over his vote to impeach former President Donald Trump</a>, and Democratic Rep. Karen Bass announced her intention to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-27/rep-karen-bass-officially-launches-la-mayor-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run for mayor of Los Angeles</a> in 2022. And just on Tuesday, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth announced he would <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/12/kentucky-democratic-rep-john-yarmuth-not-run-reelection/6103932001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retire from elected office</a> as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">House retirements are one metric we’re watching to give us a clue as to how the 2022 midterms will unfold, but on the surface at least, it doesn’t look like either party has an advantage in this regard: 10 Democrats are retiring compared with nine Republicans. However, when you dig into the specific reasons that are likely behind each retirement, it does look like Democrats are more worried than Republicans.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">At this stage, six of the Republicans are leaving the House to run for another office. Of the other three, Gonzalez is probably leaving because he would have a hard time winning his Republican primary, Rep. Tom Reed appeared to retire in response to his <a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/gop-us-rep-tom-reed-to-retire-after-sexual-misconduct-accusation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual harassment scandal</a>, and Rep. Kevin Brady said he is leaving partly because he is <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/14/kevin-brady-congress-texas-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">term-limited out of his position</a> as top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. Arguably, Reed and Rep. Lee Zeldin, who is running for governor, also decided to retire given Democrats’ control of redistricting in their home state of New York (which means they could be running on bluer turf next year). But considering they also had other factors playing into their retirements, one can argue at this point that no Republicans are retiring <em>primarily</em> out of fear of losing their general election next year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Retiring Democrats, however, appear to be more motivated by electoral concerns. Only five of the 10 retiring Democrats are running for another office, while four currently represent swing seats: Reps. Filemon Vela, Ann Kirkpatrick, Cheri Bustos and Ron Kind. And only Vela’s seat is likely to be made safely Democratic in redistricting, although he didn’t know that when he announced he was retiring. It’s reasonable, therefore, to theorize that fear of losing reelection was a key factor in their decisions to retire. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 10th retiring Democrat is Yarmuth, who currently represents a safely blue seat anchored by Louisville, Kentucky. But he may be retiring out of fear of losing reelection, too. That’s because Republicans, who control the redistricting process in Kentucky, could <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/06/republicans-redistricting-doom-democrats-498232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliminate his seat</a> by giving slices of his dark-blue 3rd District to neighboring red districts that can absorb more Democratic voters without becoming competitive — a gerrymandering technique known as “cracking.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/kentucky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky</a> hasn’t begun the redistricting process yet (at least publicly), so we don’t yet know with certainty what its new map will look like. Yarmuth’s retirement, though, could suggest that he expected Republicans to force him out. But even if they hadn’t and the 3rd District remained intact, Yarmuth may have still retired for political reasons: He is currently chair of the House Budget Committee, but he stands to lose that considerable power if Republicans take back control of the House in 2022. His retirement may indicate that he’s not optimistic about Democrats’ chances next year. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1747-1346.1999.tb00521.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political science research</a> has found that politicians are more likely to retire when they see a bad political environment for their party on the horizon.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good news for Democrats is that politicians make bad pundits: There has historically been a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-recent-rush-of-gop-retirements-is-good-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weak relationship</a> between which party sees the most retirements and which party does poorly the subsequent election. But the bad news for Democrats is that, whatever the specific motivation of Yarmuth’s retirement, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-that-loses-this-year-could-still-win-a-big-consolation-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history is clearly on the side</a> of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans having a strong performance</a> in the 2022 midterms.</p>]]></description>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): President Biden’s approval ratings are underwater — 49.2 percent disapprove of the job he is doing as president while 44.6 percent approve, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="920" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This has been true for a while now, too. Since Aug. 30, more Americans have disapproved of Biden than have approved of him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, let’s tackle Biden’s declining approval rating in three parts. First, what do we know about why his approval rating has dipped? Second, how should we think about this current dip? That is, is it unusually large or actually pretty normal? And, finally, how much do presidents’ approval ratings matter, especially at this point in their presidency?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, first up, why has Biden’s approval rating dipped?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/government-regulate-facebook-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80528845</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): Given the timing, the two biggest things that have contributed to this decline appear to be Biden’s handling of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/bidens-approval-rating-on-handling-of-covid-and-economy-fall-in-latest-cnbc-all-america-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the COVID-19 pandemic</a> — specifically, how the situation has gotten worse due to the delta variant — and his administration’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/02/1033433959/biden-approval-rating-afghanistan-withdrawal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’d assume, though, that COVID-19 is likely to have a bigger impact on Biden in the long term because Afghanistan has largely faded from the news …</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1832" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RAKICH-BIDEN-APPROVAL-DOWN-1-DESKTOP@2x-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RAKICH-BIDEN-APPROVAL-DOWN-1-DESKTOP@2x-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RAKICH-BIDEN-APPROVAL-DOWN-1-DESKTOP@2x-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RAKICH-BIDEN-APPROVAL-DOWN-1-DESKTOP@2x-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">… and the pandemic affects so much more, including the economy — and Biden’s ratings on the economy were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-only-on-ap-4dafe5b7a4adf2502280bb23b775af07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never super-high to begin with</a>. The delta variant itself, including its impact on people’s quality of life and on the economy — coupled with <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/566297-poll-inflation-named-as-top-economic-concern-among-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fears of inflation</a> — has hurt Biden’s standing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): Yeah, Alex, it’s clearly a range of factors. Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already slipping</a> before Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, for instance, as the chart above shows.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I agree that the rise of the delta variant has likely played the biggest role, though. America went from <a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/health/coronavirus/long-island-coronavirus-update-1.50285021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feeling like the pandemic was behind it</a> in early summer to experiencing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-highest caseload of the pandemic</a> by September. And Biden’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval and disapproval ratings on the coronavirus</a> dipped from 62 percent and 33 percent, respectively, on July 1 to 49.6 percent and 42.0 percent today.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1495" height="564" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-11-at-3.31.05-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-11-at-3.31.05-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-11-at-3.31.05-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-11-at-3.31.05-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That said, I can’t shake the feeling that, if it hadn’t been for the delta variant or the coronavirus, something else would have caused a decline in Biden’s ratings. Presidents’ approval ratings <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/cruel-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to dip in the summer of their first year</a> as the honeymoon period wears off and people start to notice the problems that are still around them.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst): Right, it’s possible that the situation in Afghanistan served as an inflection point. People who were already beginning to sour on Biden went ahead and said, “OK, that’s it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, I agree with that, Geoffrey. The decline in his approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-declining-approval-rating-is-not-just-about-afghanistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really accelerated</a> after the fall of Kabul. My theory is that, for the first six months of Biden’s term, many Americans were enjoying the sense of calm that had fallen over the government after four tumultuous years under former President Donald Trump — and approved of Biden because, to them, he represented a more competent leader. But Afghanistan, and also the delta variant, shattered that calm and raised questions about whether Biden really was that competent after all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> There was also evidence that, prior to the delta variant’s peak, Biden’s approval rating had <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/04/biden-approval-independents-covid-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already been dipping among independents</a>, so it certainly seems as if there’s no one answer for why Biden’s numbers have dropped.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How big a deal is this slump, though? For over a month now, more Americans have disapproved of Biden than have approved of him. Is that unusual at this point in a president’s term?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nraki</strong><strong>ch:</strong> Looking at the past several decades, it’s unusual. Only two other presidents since 1945 have had net negative approval ratings at this point in their terms: Gerald Ford (-9.1 points) and Trump (-18.2 points), and only one other president was below water at any point in his first 265 days (Bill Clinton).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect Biden to match the average approval rating of presidents at this point in their terms, which is 61 percent. American politics is more polarized now than at any other point in the past 80 years, so recent presidents have tended to have approval ratings closer to 50-50 at this point. In that sense, Biden should be graded on somewhat of a curve — but even then, he’s still doing worse than former President Barack Obama (+12.1 points) on Oct. 11, 2009.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Yeah, everyone expected Biden’s approval rating to drop at some point because every president except for Trump has benefited from a honeymoon period of above-average approval ratings when they first assumed the presidency. Those honeymoon periods invariably end.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But certain things like the COVID-19 pandemic, immigration and Afghanistan probably accelerated the disapproval numbers we’re seeing now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> For what it’s worth, though, Biden also started out at a lower number to begin with, undoubtedly in part because of how polarized our political environment is, as Nathaniel said. Biden has had <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/329384/presidential-approval-ratings-joe-biden.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an approval rating above 90 percent among Democrats</a>, but his approval among Republicans has been, at best, around 20 percent <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-approval-rating-has-barely-budged-in-his-first-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in some polls</a>, and more like 10 percent in others.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That polarization obviously also contributed to Trump’s circumstances. And because of it, some of the comparisons to presidents further back in time are harder to make. Nowadays, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-should-we-expect-of-bidens-approval-rating-in-the-first-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Americans no longer tend</a> to give a new president from the other party some early benefit of the doubt. For instance, John F. Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower both started their presidencies with approval ratings around 70 percent or higher. That’s not happening again anytime soon.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Right, I think the days of a president getting a 70 percent approval rating right out of the gate are clearly over. But we saw early on that Biden still had very low disapproval ratings — as low as 34 percent at one point. So, I think some people — specifically, Trump voters — were giving Biden the benefit of the doubt. But they eventually returned to their partisan corners. You can see how Biden’s disapproval rating has inched up for basically his whole term, though the rate of increase accelerated in August.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> On that note, we’ve found that presidents’ approval ratings <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to revert to the mean</a>, and at least since Obama, these ratings have been pretty steady, moving within a fairly narrow band. Can the same be said of Biden at this point? Or is it a big deal that his approval rating has dipped by as much as it has for as long as it has? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> It’s definitely something his administration (and all Democrats) will have to account for, especially as we get closer to next year’s midterm elections. I’d imagine that most Democrats seeking office right now are wondering this: “How do I engage my base without having an obvious bogeyman (Trump) to point to or a popular standard-bearer (Biden) to hitch my star to?” And what legislative victories will they be able to point to next year? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this probably puts more pressure on the Biden administration to figure things out with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/wall-street-says-to-prep-for-infrastructure-and-budget-reconciliations-bills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the infrastructure and reconciliation bills</a>. I’m skeptical that passing either bill will significantly change Democrats’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-2022-be-a-good-year-for-republicans-yes-we-know-its-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall midterm outlook</a>, but doing so could shore up some enthusiasm among his base — which Biden <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/21/voter-enthusiasm-midterms-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could certainly use right now</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Biden’s approval has actually been pretty steady compared with that of past presidents in their early days. If you look at the middle-50 percent range of daily average approval ratings in FiveThirtyEight’s approval data for presidents in their first nine or so months, Biden and Trump have seen the least variation of any of them, with less than a 4 percentage point difference between the high and low ends of that middle-50 percent. More broadly, Biden’s approval rating has dropped as low as 44 percent, but even then, the range between his highest and lowest marks is only 11 points — the same went for Trump — while Obama and Clinton had differences of 17 and 24 points, respectively. (George W. Bush’s approval skyrocketed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, making him a less useful comparison.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Do we have a sense of how strong some of this opposition to Biden now is? The Cook Political Report’s Amy Walter had <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/intensity-opposition-biden-rises-solid-support-drops-august" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written earlier in September</a> that not only was Biden struggling with more Americans disapproving of the job he was doing as president, but more Americans were <em>strongly</em> disapproving of it. Is this still the case? What does that mean if some of the opposition is so baked in?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes. Just as with Trump, the vast majority of those who dislike Biden do so with a passion. In an average of polls conducted entirely in October so far, 42 percent of respondents <em>strongly</em> disapproved of his job performance, while only 10 percent<em> somewhat</em> disapproved. And his strong disapproval numbers are on the rise. Back in May, his average strong disapproval rating was only 32 percent, while his average somewhat disapproval rating was still 10 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">(Of course, it’s probably that some people went from approving of Biden to somewhat disapproving of him, and others went from somewhat disapproving of him to strongly disapproving of him. But regardless, it’s not a good trend for him.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Of the possible reasons Biden’s approval rating has slumped, you all seem to agree that his handling of the pandemic might be his biggest liability. Does that mean if the pandemic turns a corner in the U.S. — as it’s showing signs of doing — that we should expect Biden’s numbers to bounce back?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I think probably? It seems likely that, in the best-case scenario where the pandemic goes away completely, everyone would be extremely happy, and happy people tend to like their presidents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I think so too. At least among some constituencies. But I’m not sure that’ll happen, namely because we’re seeing some of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccine-hesitancy-is-still-strong-in-many-covid-19-battered-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest vaccine-hesitancy rates in Republican-led states</a>, and it’s Republicans, not Democrats, who have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/20/vaccine-hesitant-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most skeptical of vaccines and mask-wearing</a>. I’m not quite sure what Biden can do to combat that — it may not be something within his power to change.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I wouldn’t expect an improving COVID-19 picture to solve all Biden’s problems either, as the pandemic isn’t the only thing tanking his approval now. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> If the public thinks things are going better, then sure, there’ll be some uptick. I wouldn’t expect many Republicans to approve of Biden, but it could cause his numbers among independents and Democrats to go back up some.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nra</strong><strong>kich:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/us/politics/biden-approval-ratings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate Cohn at The New York Times</a> found that much of the dip in Biden’s approval has been driven by historically Democratic voting blocs. Those groups might come back to the fold if happy times get here again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Yeah, Nathaniel, some research also suggests that Biden’s standing among Black voters isn’t too great right now. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-falling-poll-numbers-georgia/2021/10/10/3606c99e-2002-11ec-8200-5e3fd4c49f5e_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dove into this more</a>, but essentially, a Black man in Georgia who worked to help elect Biden in 2020 argued that the president’s lack of progress on police reform, a $15 minimum wage and voting-rights legislation might make it harder for him to appeal to Black voters in future elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Obviously, Black voters are a key Democratic constituency, so this could have huge ramifications for Biden. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/22/biden-black-voters-vaccine-mandate-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll from September</a> also seemed to show that some Black voters were turned off by Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-requiring-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-for-federal-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine mandate</a>. Per the survey, Biden’s net approval rating dropped 12 points among Black voters. Among unvaccinated Black voters, there was a 17-point drop.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> It’ll be interesting to see how long attrition among Democrats lasts given how polarized our politics are. But one reason we cover president’s approval ratings so extensively is that they can be useful for understanding a president’s reelection chances or how his party might fare in the midterms. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What does Biden’s approval rating tell us at this point? And what will you be watching moving forward?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> It’s probably too early to draw any big conclusions from Biden’s approval numbers now. But past elections indicate that the severity of midterm losses loosely correlates with the popularity of the president. Here’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-up-republican-house-chances-are-down-does-that-make-any-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a chart FiveThirtyEight published</a> in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, when Trump was unpopular and Republicans went on to lose the House:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="936" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SILVER-EU1022-1022-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SILVER-EU1022-1022-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SILVER-EU1022-1022-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SILVER-EU1022-1022-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">To simplify things a bit, Gallup found <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/141812/avg-midterm-seat-loss-presidents-below-approval.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2010</a> that when postwar presidents had an approval rating of 50 percent or more around the time of a midterm election, their party lost an average of only 14 seats in the House. But if a president’s approval rating was any lower than 50 percent, the average loss was 36 seats. Using more recent data, from 1970 to 2014, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-midterm-elections-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg put the average loss</a> at 33 seats for presidents with approval ratings below 50 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fifty percent isn’t some magic inflection point. But, all else being equal, the more popular Biden is come election time in 2022, the better congressional Democrats’ prospects will be.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I think there’s still time for Biden’s approval ratings to recover, but (i) whether that happens and (ii) by how much will have a big impact on how his party fares in both 2022 and 2024. I’ll be watching Biden’s approval among voters of color specifically, though, and whether Republicans use that to try to build on <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their gains with Black and Hispanic voters</a> in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, if Biden has the same approval rating in November 2022 as he does now, Democrats will clearly be toast in the midterms. But there is ample time for it to either get better or get worse before then, so I don’t think the numbers mean much for now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Democrats shouldn’t feel like they just have to get Biden’s approval rating back above 50 percent to avoid midterm losses. The president’s party loses seats in all but the most popular presidencies. The only recent presidents who gained House seats in a midterm election, Bill Clinton in 1998 and George W. Bush in 2002, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had approval ratings in the 60s</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, basically, I think Republicans will gain seats in 2022, but I think it’s too early to tell how many.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> To Nathaniel’s point, it’s nearly impossible to imagine circumstances where Biden’s approval will top 60 percent in this polarized political environment. Perhaps the target figure should be more like 55 percent now because the band of possibilities for presidential approval has narrowed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, it will be challenging for Biden to even get back there to help Democrats hold or even gain ground. Of course, this is mostly about the House, which is a truly national election with all 435 seats up. But the Senate is harder to nail down in some ways because only about one-third of it is up in 2022, so the national political environment doesn’t have as much of a 1:1 effect on outcomes there. Take 2018, for example: Trump was way underwater and Republicans lost the House, but they <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-state-democrats-became-an-endangered-species-in-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actually gained ground in the Senate</a> because Democrats <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/2018-senate-democrats-are-very-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to defend a sizable number of seats in red states</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Put another way, the relationship between presidential approval and seat loss for the president’s party is not as highly correlated in the Senate as it is in the House. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, the Senate voted to temporarily raise the debt ceiling through early December, but the political conflict over a longer-term increase continues.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Most Democrats in Congress are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-house-democrats-may-be-more-united-than-they-seem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">united around the Democratic agenda</a>, but a small number of senators and representatives have so far been able to hold up its passage. “I need 50 votes in the Senate. I have 48,” President Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-agenda-liberals-jayapal/2021/10/05/0caa2da0-25e0-11ec-8d53-67cfb452aa60_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said last week</a>, regarding his social spending bill. As for who is standing in the way, his blame was clear: “Two. Two people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those two people are Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. The two moderates have forced Democrats to water down several priorities (such as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/14/1036812609/senate-democrats-offer-a-new-voting-bill-but-a-gop-filibuster-likely-blocks-the-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election reform</a> and the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/23/sinema-35t-spending-bill-506583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion budget bill</a>) and are blocking more ambitious reforms entirely (such as abolishing the filibuster). But while congressional observers — from the commander-in-chief on down — usually mention Manchin and Sinema in the same sentence, it’s a mistake to lump together their resistance to their party’s priorities. Manchin’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centrism is unsurprising</a>: He has been a conservative Democrat his entire career, and his home state of West Virginia is so red that it might be politically impossible for him to move left, even if he wanted to. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But neither is true of Sinema. Once a staunch progressive, Arizona’s senior senator has taken a hard turn to the right. On the surface, that appears to have been an effort to make her more electable by courting moderate and conservative voters. If so, she may have overcompensated: Arizona is no West Virginia, and no other swing-state senator has vexed Democratic leadership so thoroughly. In fact, Sinema’s established such a firm anti-progressive reputation that she may have lost the support of enough <em>Democrats</em> to endanger her reelection just the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sinema’s resistance to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/kyrsten-sinema-minimum-wage-thumbs-down.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">core pieces</a> of her <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2021/06/22/sinema-defends-filibuster-on-same-day-its-used-to-stall-voting-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party’s agenda</a> may seem puzzling from an electoral perspective, and it’s possible that a motivation other than winning reelection is behind her contrarianism (more on that later). But it’s also possible that she’s striking the ideal strategic balance between primary and general election electability.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, is Sinema right?</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Sinema began her political career as a self-described “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/kyrsten-sinema-a-success-story-like-nobody-elses/2013/01/02/d31fadaa-5382-11e2-a613-ec8d394535c6_story.html?utm_term=.24b88e7bc58a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prada socialist</a>.” Originally a member of the Arizona Green Party, she was a vocal liberal activist who organized <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/politics/kfile-kyrsten-sinema-activist-past/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-war protests</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-road-to-the-senate-runs-straight-through-trump-country-1520266957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marches for immigrants’ rights</a>. After a failed bid for the Arizona state legislature in 2002, she switched to the Democratic Party and went on to serve three terms in the state House and one in the state Senate. According to <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/GZJOT3&amp;version=1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideology scores for state legislators</a> calculated by political scientists Boris Shor and Nolan McCarty, she was the House’s second- or third-most liberal member during her tenure, and the Senate’s single most liberal member in 2011-12.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But when she was elected to the U.S. Congress in 2012, a switch flipped. She immediately became the <a href="https://voteview.com/person/21300/kyrsten-sinema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most conservative Democrat</a> in the House of Representatives, according to DW-Nominate, which uses voting records to quantify the ideology of every member of Congress on a scale from 1 (most conservative) to -1 (most liberal). She has a career DW-Nominate score of -0.103, which currently makes her the second-most conservative Democrat in the Senate, after Manchin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The conventional wisdom is that Sinema rushed toward the center for electoral reasons, as she moved from representing a solidly blue electorate to purpler ones. Former President Obama carried her state legislative seat by 26 percentage points in 2008 (according to local analyst Aseem Chandi), but Obama carried her congressional seat by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 5 points</a> in 2012. While her district became more safely Democratic later in her House career, she may have already been laying the groundwork for her Senate run. “Kyrsten has always had her eyes on a larger electorate,” Tempe City Councilwoman Lauren Kuby <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/us/politics/kyrsten-sinema-arizona.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The New York Times</a> in 2018. (Tempe is a city in Sinema’s old district.) And to win a statewide campaign, Sinema needed to win over even more swing voters: Former President Trump carried Arizona by almost <a href="https://apps.azsos.gov/election/2016/General/Official%20Signed%20State%20Canvass.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 points</a> in 2016. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But while no one denies that Arizona is a tough state for Democrats to win, it’s not nearly as tough as Manchin’s West Virginia, which Trump carried by a whopping <a href="https://services.sos.wv.gov/apps/elections/results/results.aspx?year=2016&amp;eid=23&amp;county=Statewide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42 points</a> in 2016. West Virginia is no swing state; it’s one of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddest states in the entire country</a>. And while six non-Sinema Democrats have won a statewide election in Arizona since 2018 — including Biden in 2020<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other five are Sen. Mark Kelly, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman and Corporation Commissioners Sandra Kennedy and Anna Tovar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> — Manchin is the only Democratic statewide elected official left in West Virginia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Democrats are lucky that Manchin is in the Senate at all. Because of how red West Virginia is, a typical senator from the state would almost certainly be a Republican.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if so, that would hand Republicans control of the Senate, considering Democrats have the majority now only by dint of Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> Indeed, based on Trump’s margin in West Virginia in 2016, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-the-trump-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’d expect</a> that a generic replacement for Manchin would have voted in line with Trump’s position 89.3 percent of the time during his presidency. Manchin, though, voted with Trump just <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/joe-manchin-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50.4 percent</a> of the time — a lot for a Democrat, but not a lot considering the partisanship of his home state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using the same methodology, we’d have expected a generic replacement for Sinema to vote with Trump just 39.8 percent of the time — a reflection of the purpler partisanship of her state and her congressional district at the time. Yet Sinema voted with him <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/kyrsten-sinema/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50.4 percent</a> of the time too, as much as Manchin. That made her the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only Democratic senator</a> who voted with Trump significantly<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 5 percentage points more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> <em>more often</em> than expected based on the politics of senators’ states. Her voting record during the Trump years looked more like Manchin’s, Sen. Joe Donnelly’s, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp’s or Sen. Claire McCaskill’s — all Democrats from substantially redder states.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current congress</a>, Sinema has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/kyrsten-sinema/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted perfectly in line</a> with the Biden administration and her party on bills <em>that came up for a vote</em>. But as we’ve seen with negotiations over the reconciliation bill and more, that leaves a lot out. Sinema still ranks as more ideologically conservative than other Democratic senators from once-red-but-trending-blue states: <a href="https://voteview.com/person/42103/thomas-jonathan-jon-ossoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Ossoff</a> (who has a DW-Nominate score of -0.448 so far) and <a href="https://voteview.com/person/42105/raphael-gamaliel-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raphael Warnock</a> (-0.380) of Georgia, and even her fellow Arizonan, <a href="https://voteview.com/person/41905/mark-edward-kelly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Kelly</a> (-0.186).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Sinema is acting moderate for electoral reasons, she clearly disagrees with the conventional wisdom about <em>how</em> moderate a swing-state senator needs to be. On one hand, maybe she has a point: Donnelly, Heitkamp and McCaskill all lost reelection in 2018, as did Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida is about as purple as Arizona but who voted with Trump less often than Sinema did. All four voted with Trump significantly less often than we’d have expected given the partisanship of their state, suggesting that Sinema’s strategy of hewing closer to expectations might have been smarter. (Although this doesn’t justify her approach of voting with Trump <em>more</em> often than expected.) On the other hand, political science research has found that candidates and congressional aides are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/05/why-kyrsten-sinemas-political-position-is-so-baffling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really bad at assessing where voters stand on the issues</a>. One <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/miller-stokes/08_MillerStokes_BroockmanSkovron.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 study</a> found that politicians overestimated by several percentage points how conservative their constituents were, in direct contradiction of Sinema’s entire theory of the case.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Maybe Sinema just figures she can’t be too careful. But if that’s the case, she’ll just win reelection in a landslide, right? Perhaps — but there are also downsides to moving too far to the center. For every inch of ground she gains with swing voters by demonstrating her independence from the Democratic Party, she risks alienating the Democratic base. And it’s not at all clear whether that’s a winning electoral tradeoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a convenient natural experiment, an <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/kelly-leads-in-all-head-to-head-matchups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights poll</a> from early September asked Arizona registered voters their opinions of Sinema and Kelly, who serves as a kind of control variable for Sinema: a Democratic senator from Arizona who <em>isn’t</em> a thorn in his party’s side. Accounting for the poll’s margin of error, the two had virtually identical favorable and unfavorable ratings: 46 percent to 39 percent for Sinema, 47 percent to 43 percent for Kelly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that topline similarity obscured major differences in their underlying coalitions. Kelly had very conventional party splits in his popularity: Democrats viewed him favorably, 80 percent to 11 percent, while Republicans viewed him unfavorably, 73 percent to 20 percent. Sinema’s heterodoxy, though, earned her a much more lukewarm rating among Democrats: 56 percent favorable, 30 percent unfavorable. At the same time, it endeared her to Republicans, an impressive 40 percent of whom had a favorable opinion of her (versus 48 percent who had an unfavorable opinion). Independents, though, rated the two of them virtually the same.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sinema is presumably betting that Democrats who dislike her will vote for her regardless, <em>and</em> that at least some Republicans who like her will vote for her, too. It’s not an outlandish notion: Those liberal Democrats, as frustrated as they are at Sinema, will probably find her Republican opponent more odious, and while there aren’t a lot of voters who can be persuaded to cross party lines, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/just-how-many-swing-voters-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they do exist</a>. But it’s just as possible that some of those Democratic disapprovers will be so frustrated with Sinema that they’ll skip voting in the Senate race. And just because a Republican voter likes Sinema doesn’t mean they’ll choose her over a candidate of their own party. Since Sinema is next up for reelection in 2024, she’ll be asking those voters to cast ballots for her at the same time as they are very likely voting for the Republican presidential candidate. That’s a big ask considering <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how few voters split their tickets</a> in this highly polarized era. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Democratic opinion of Sinema sinks low enough, she could even be in danger of losing in a primary. Progressives are already <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/could-sen-kyrsten-sinema-face-primary-these-progressives-are-trying-n1280392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gearing up to challenge her</a>; two groups have formed to help fund her eventual opponents, and another is hoping to recruit progressive Rep. Ruben Gallego to run against her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s extremely rare for elected incumbent senators to lose their primaries. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X97S6hUby6PPHAMoEwvAxkAUo8EUwLk8xMosx4hVd8c/htmlview?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Only five have done so this century</a>: Republican Sen. Bob Smith in 2002, Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman in 2006, Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter in 2010, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski in 2010<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lieberman and Murkowski, however, went on to win their general elections as independents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> and Republican Sen. Richard Lugar in 2012.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, appointed Sen. Luther Strange lost the Alabama Republican primary in 2017, and Sen. Bob Bennett lost renomination at the Utah Republican convention in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> But it’s also rare for incumbent senators to poll as poorly among their own party’s voters as Sinema does. In addition to the OH Predictive Insights poll, Democratic registered voters in Arizona gave her a 46 percent favorable rating and a 40 percent unfavorable rating in a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/04/sinema-manchin-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> survey conducted across July, August and September.

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Sinema’s primary is still almost three years away, so there is plenty of time for her numbers to improve — if she lets them. But if nothing changes, she could be vulnerable. And even if she prevails, a tough primary could make it harder to win the general election by sapping her resources and creating Democratic disunity. Arizona’s primary is relatively late on the calendar (August), which may not give primary winners enough time to recover and run a strong general election campaign. (Then-Rep. Martha McSally’s campaign <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2018/11/28/martha-mcsally-campaign-not-her-fault-lost-kyrsten-sinema/2138224002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partly blamed</a> her tough Republican primary for her loss to Sinema in the 2018 general election.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What’s the right balance for Sinema — or any senator, really — to strike between concern for the primary and concern for the general? It may depend on the partisanship of their state. The table below lists all the elected incumbent senators who have lost reelection since 2000 in either a primary or general election. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all the incumbents who lost primaries represented states that leaned toward their party (though some, like Specter and Smith, did represent swing states). All the incumbents who lost reelection on the opposite party’s home turf did so in the general.</p>

 <footer><p>*Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean. In this case, positive numbers are toward the senator’s party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">While Arizona is a swing state, it is still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly Republican-leaning</a>. (Biden carried it by only a hair in 2020, suggesting that he would have lost there if the national environment hadn’t been so Democratic-leaning.) So perhaps Sinema is right not to fear a primary challenge; it would be unprecedented in recent history for someone in her position to lose renomination. Then again, few politicians have pushed the envelope of what their base will tolerate as much as Sinema has. It’s an obvious point, but while Arizona might be light red overall, the Democratic primary electorate will be mostly Democrats and Democratic leaners — a group that, in Arizona, self-identifies as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/primaries-caucuses/entrance-and-exit-polls/arizona/democratic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61 percent liberal and only 33 percent moderate</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reason that Democratic senators in red states and Republican senators in blue states tend not to lose their primaries isn’t because members of the opposite party are voting for them in the primary; it’s more that voters are afraid to throw them out, or that opponents are afraid to challenge them, lest it endanger the party’s hold on the seat in the general election. But Sinema is putting to the test whether this concern outweighs the grassroots dissent against her. That’s a big risk.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Up to now, we haven’t questioned the assumption that Sinema’s maverickness is motivated by a desire to win elections. But as we’ve seen, if that’s Sinema’s goal, her strategy for attaining it is unconventional at best and counterproductive at worst. That naturally raises one final question: If not winning reelection, what else could be motivating Sinema?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It may be her donors. In a September report, liberal group Accountable.US found that Sinema raised <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163745/kyrsten-sinema-corporate-donations-chamber-commerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least $923,065</a> from business interests that opposed Biden’s budget reconciliation plan, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a longtime Sinema ally. She’s also been the recipient of large donations from the <a href="https://khn.org/news/a-senator-from-arizona-emerges-as-a-pharma-favorite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharmaceutical industry</a>, which <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163745/kyrsten-sinema-corporate-donations-chamber-commerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critics have blamed</a> for her opposition to letting Medicare negotiate down drug costs. Of course, it’s possible that the causation is reversed — that such interest groups are donating to her because they like her positions on these issues. That said, <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/out-of-district_contributors_web_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study</a> found that politicians <em>did</em> adjust their positions based on donor preferences. “When the national donor base prefers a different outcome than a representative’s general and primary electorates,” the authors wrote, “overwhelmingly the member chooses the donor-favored position.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another explanation for Sinema’s centrism could be that she genuinely believes in it. In her 2009 book “Unite and Conquer,” Sinema <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kyrsten-sinema-not-progressive_n_5bdca881e4b09d43e31edfa3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> how she was initially frustrated at her inability to get things done in the state legislature — so she decided to stop being a “bomb-thrower” and start working with Republicans. Perhaps now, after so many years of embedding with the GOP to get things done (this is the first time she has ever served in a legislative chamber controlled by Democrats), she has internalized the conservatism of her peers — and even <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/29/kyrsten-sinema-arizona-democrats-060187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embraced bipartisanship as a policy goal unto itself</a>. (That would explain her fierce opposition to ending the filibuster and her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/30/politics/krysten-sinema-infrastructure-deal-backlash/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dogged negotiation</a> of a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill earlier this year.) What else, besides personal conviction, can explain why she has maintained her contrarianism in the face of <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kyrsten-sinema-biden-reconciliation_n_61548b6ae4b075408bd1e9fc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frustrated colleagues</a>, <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2021/10/05/protesters-confront-sinema-directly-she-calls-the-move-unacceptable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggressive protesters</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/us/kyrsten-sinema-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the potential end of her political career</a>? It could be that she really is acting on principle. Or it could be that she thinks this is her smartest move politically. Or it could be some combination of both. Unfortunately, we might never know for sure.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How Fast Is The Economy Recovering?<br>
By Julia Wolfe and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</p>
<p>For nearly a year, the economy has been on a long, exhausting slog toward post-pandemic “normalcy.” And it isn’t over yet.</p>
<p>This page — which we plan to update every month — will tell us how far we still have to go before the economy is back where it was before the pandemic shut down much of American life.</p>
<p>We have made significant progress, of course: After hitting the highest level of unemployment the country has seen since the Great Depression in April, the unemployment rate has steadily fallen.</p>
<p>But as of this month, we’re still 3.2 percentage points higher than the pre-pandemic unemployment rate.</p>
<p>Change from January 2020 in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate<br>
Jan.<br>
Dec.<br>
+11.3<br>
+3.2<br>
The unemployment rate in December was 6.7%, according to the latest jobs report, unchanged from 6.7% in November.</p>
<p>Crucially, the recovery isn’t affecting all workers equally. Just as Black and Hispanic communities have struggled with higher rates of infection and death since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, communities of color are continuing to bear the brunt of high unemployment and economic insecurity, even as the overall numbers fall.</p>

Even in good times, Black unemployment often hovers at levels much higher than for white Americans. But the pandemic has exacerbated that stubborn inequality, and now we’re in the midst of a profoundly unequal economic crisis. Low-wage workers — who are disproportionately likely to be Black and Hispanic — have been hardest hit by the pandemic because they generally work in sectors, like retail and hospitality, where their work can’t be done from home. Those workplaces pose significant public health risks in a pandemic, and have been subjected to full or partial shutdowns as infections ebb and flow.</p>
<p>As a result, we’re much closer to economic normalcy in sectors like construction and professional and business services than we are in sectors like leisure and hospitality.</p>

Some sectors have been able to adjust (more or less) to the realities of the pandemic, but others, like leisure and hospitality and education and health services, have left their workers in a painful no-win situation. They face precarious employment, with temporary furloughs or permanent layoffs always on the horizon, plus the unenviable prospect of going to work every day with the risk of infection hanging over their heads.</p>
<p>These disparities are important to remember because even when employment appears to be approaching pre-pandemic normalcy, a lot of people aren’t part of that economic rebound — and those workers are still disproportionately likely to be people of color, young and low-wage.</p>
<p>Check back next month for an update on how close — or far — we are to the levels of unemployment we saw before the pandemic.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">As President Biden and other Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/09/30/us/government-shutdown-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work to pass</a> an omnibus budget bill, members of the party are at odds over the topline spending number, with figures ranging between <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/30/manchin-proposed-15t-topline-number-to-schumer-this-summer-514803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 trillion</a> to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/budget-reconciliation-bill-build-back-better-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion</a>. Biden has said it’s likely the bill <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-floats-roughly-2-trillion-price-tag-for-reconciliation-08740ed0-2db3-4ce7-8088-2a1d36644e38.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will end up in the $2 trillion range</a>, which means progressives’ priorities will surely be shrunk, cut or reworked. Progressive lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/podcasts/the-daily/biden-infrastructure-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have signaled</a> that they’re open to compromise, but some are warning that there’s <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/democrats-look-to-break-impasse-on-spending-climate-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least one area</a> they’ll refuse to give ground on: climate-related provisions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Climate change could thus prove to be one of the main sticking points between progressives and centrists in the party. From the progressives’ point of view, the reconciliation bill <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/15/1036954961/congress-is-debating-its-biggest-climate-change-bill-ever-heres-whats-at-stake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be the federal government’s best shot</a> at tackling the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/20/climate-crisis-environment-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly escalating climate crisis</a> in the near future. And New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that climate provisions are not something Congress can “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-on-face-the-nation-october-3-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kick down the line</a>.” Meanwhile, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, one of the key centrists needed to pass the bill who has already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successfully blocked</a> some of Biden’s priority items, has said that he <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/manchin-slams-3-5t-plan-says-climate-bill-makes-no-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposes the current bill’s primary climate provision</a>: paying utilities to switch to clean energy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So where does the public stand on combating climate change? Even before <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/07/24/amid-summer-fire-floods-moment-truth-climate-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent devastating weather events</a>, Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have long said</a> that the federal government wasn’t doing enough. And polls now suggest that public opinion is more on the side of progressives. But the big caveat here is how Americans prioritize action on climate change versus other issues.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-starting-make-climate-agenda-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-78546775</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, a majority of Americans want action on climate. According to a newly released survey from <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_100421/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University</a>, 60 percent of U.S. adults said that climate change was “very” or “extremely” important for the federal government to address. Furthermore, 56 percent of U.S. adults said climate change was a “very serious” problem — up from 41 percent in the same poll in December 2015. A recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/14/americans-are-less-concerned-but-more-divided-on-climate-change-than-people-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study from Pew Research Center</a> found that 60 percent of U.S. adults said they were worried about the personal impacts of climate change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/climate/republicans-climate-change.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become slightly more open</a> to climate proposals, but there’s still a big partisan divide on the issue. Monmouth found only 30 percent of Republicans said they supported government action on climate change, versus 92 percent of Democrats. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355427/americans-concerned-global-warming.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup survey</a> released earlier this week yielded similar results. Combining survey data from 2017 to 2021, Gallup found that 65 percent of U.S. adults said they “worry a great deal” or a “fair amount” about global warming. Among Democrats, that number jumped to 91 percent; among Republicans, it was only 32 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other surveys, though, suggest there’s widespread support for enacting specific federal policies to combat climate change. Per a 2020 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Pew</a>, 79 percent of U.S. adults said their country should prioritize developing alternative sources of energy. Seventy-eight percent of Republicans and 90 percent of Democrats supported providing businesses with a tax credit if they developed carbon capture/storage, while 64 percent of Republicans and 93 percent of Democrats said they wanted tougher restrictions on carbon emissions from power plants. In fact, a majority of Republicans — and an overwhelming majority of Democrats — favored all five climate policies that Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/ps_2020-06-23_government-and-climate_00-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked about</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, recent research has also shown that the budget bill’s climate-related proposals are wildly popular with the public. According to <a href="https://publicconsultation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Reconciliation_Budget_Report_0921.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study from the University of Maryland</a>, which analyzed several polls on proposals in the reconciliation budget, 85 percent of registered voters supported reestablishing the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/09/16/civilian-climate-corps-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> and 83 percent supported the creation of a jobs program hiring unemployed coal workers to close down coal mines and remediate the landscape.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But here’s the catch: While Americans believe tackling climate change is important, that doesn’t mean they see it as the<em> most</em> important issue. In the Monmouth survey mentioned earlier, issues like jobs and unemployment (77 percent), the COVID-19 pandemic (72 percent) and racial inequality (65 percent) topped Americans’ list of “extremely important” or “very important” concerns for the federal government to address. A <a href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/94/2021/09/Politico-HSPH-Sept-Oct-2021-poll-report-topline-092821.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Harvard poll</a> conducted in mid-September found that climate-related spending did not land in the top five “extremely important” issues that U.S. adults wanted included in the budget bill. The highest-priority climate-related issue — increasing spending on conservation efforts to curb wildfires and carbon emissions — came in at sixth place, while a policy to encourage people to buy electric cars ranked dead last in the list of 20 priorities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Politics to address climate change will need to overcome other obstacles as well. The oil and gas industry is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/climate/api-exxon-biden-climate-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lobbying against some of the bill’s</a> climate-related proposals, for example. And Manchin, who will need to sign off on the bill’s final language, represents West Virginia, which is among the nation’s top producers of <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=69&amp;t=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coal</a> and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/where-our-natural-gas-comes-from.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural gas</a>. He is currently the top recipient of campaign donations from the coal, mining and oil and gas industries, per <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/joe-manchin/industries?cid=N00032838&amp;cycle=2022&amp;type=C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSecrets</a>. He also has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal financial stakes in the fossil fuel industry</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For now, though, considering that progressive Democrats successfully stopped the infrastructure bill from passing last week, it’s notable that they’re already drawing another line in the sand on the spending bill. We’ll be keeping an eye out for what gets cut and what goes into the final bill. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites </strong></h2>



<ul><li>A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/06/two-thirds-of-republicans-want-trump-to-retain-major-political-role-44-want-him-to-run-again-in-2024/">Pew Research Center survey</a> from September found that 67 percent of Republicans would like to see former President Donald Trump remain as a major national political figure. That’s up 10 percentage points from a poll conducted by Pew just after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. </li><li>A recent <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/virginia-2021-dead-heat-in-governor-and-attorney-general-race">Emerson College/Nexstar Media poll</a> showed a tied race for Virginia’s upcoming gubernatorial election, with 49 percent of likely voters supporting Democrat Terry McAuliffe and 49 percent supporting Republican Glenn Youngkin. FiveThirtyEight’s updating average of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/">Virginia governor polls</a> currently has McAuliffe at 47.5 percent<strong> </strong>and Youngkin at 45 percent.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a></li><li>Americans want to get spooky again this Halloween. Per a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/06/halloween-costumes-parties-candy-2021/">new Morning Consult poll</a>, 56 percent of adults said they planned to celebrate Halloween this year, up 14 points from those who planned to celebrate in 2020. This year’s share of celebrating adults is more in line with pre-COVID-19 levels — 57 percent of surveyed Americans said they celebrated Halloween in 2019. </li><li>A majority of Americans view both major political parties unfavorably. Per a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355280/party-favorable-ratings-near-parity-viewed-negatively.aspx">recently released Gallup poll</a>, 55 percent of surveyed adults said they had an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party and 56 percent an unfavorable view of the Republican Party. That being said, the GOP’s favorability rating (now 40 percent) increased 3 points between January and September, while the Democratic Party’s favorability (now 43 percent) dropped by 5 points during the same time period.</li><li>Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s popularity may be suffering from her opposition to the Democrats’ proposed spending bill, according to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/04/sinema-manchin-approval-rating/">a new Morning Consult poll</a>. Sinema’s approval among Arizona voters dropped 6 percentage points since the start of the year, from 48 percent to 42 percent. This drop left voter disapproval of Sinema equal to voter approval of her, at 42 percent. Sinema’s disapproval rating <em>among Democrats</em> dropped 20 points from the beginning of the year, to 40 percent now. But her disapproval among Democrats was somewhat offset by her improved approval rating among Republicans, which increased by 9 points.</li><li>As President Biden and the Democrats continue to negotiate the reconciliation bill — and hold off voting on the bipartisan infrastructure bill — approval of how Biden has handled rebuilding the country’s infrastructure has dipped, according to a new <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-09/topline-abc-biden-approval-09.29.21.pdf">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a>. A majority of Americans (55 percent) approved of Biden’s handling of U.S. infrastructure, but that’s down 7 points since August. Democrats are hoping to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill and reconciliation bill <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/schumer-aims-to-pass-biden-infrastructure-build-back-better-plans-in-october.html">by the end of October</a>.</li><li>Facebook <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids">paused its development of Instagram Kids</a> — a version of the app made specifically for children under 13 years old. The Sept. 27 pause followed the leak of internal studies — by recently revealed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043194385/whistleblowers-testimony-facebook-instagram">whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> — that had found that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">Instagram was negatively affecting the mental health of teen girls</a>. For some parents, the pause of Instagram Kids may come as a relief. A recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/05/instagram-kids-social-media-polling/">Morning Consult poll</a> found that 53 percent of parents with kids aged 5 to 13 either strongly or somewhat opposed the creation of Instagram Kids. Additionally, 87 percent of those parents said they were concerned about the impact of social media on the mental health of children. </li><li>A small majority of American adults (51 percent) said there shouldn’t be more government regulation for social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Sixty-one percent of Republicans agreed with this sentiment, while 59 percent of Democrats disagreed and thought there should be more regulation of these platforms, per a recent <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us10052021_uype37.pdf">Quinnipiac University poll</a>.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

Including leaners, the poll found a 49-49 tie; without leaners, McAuliffe had 49 percent and Youngkin 48 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Over a year and a half ago, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, an estimated 767,000 people in the U.S. have died from the disease, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">120.2 million have been infected</a>. Though vaccination rates have increased and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new cases have decreased</a> in recent weeks, COVID-19 continues to affect the lives of people across the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/uncontrolled-spread-scott-gottlieb/1139568341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new book</a>, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a Pfizer board member and former head of the Food and Drug Administration, argues that the U.S. was unable to control the spread of the novel coronavirus because of structural failures, and offers recommendations on how to prepare for future pandemics. In this episode of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politics podcast</a>, he joins FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver and Maggie Koerth to discuss why the U.S. was so unprepared and how much the country’s response to the public health crisis has improved since the onset of the pandemic.</p>
