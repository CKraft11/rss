<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a familiar pattern for this year’s midterm elections: One <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/25/abortion-gop-candidates-governors-races-00058713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate for governor</a> is trying to make the other one talk about abortion. But in most states, it’s the Democrat who’s pushing abortion into the conversation. In Kansas, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-abortion-presidential-legislature-cd8d1d6f24da4612b7faeb325a4611bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s the Republican</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just two months after Kansas voters <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/05/1115808472/kansas-abortion-ballot-measure-campaign-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphatically rejected a ballot initiative</a> that would have removed abortion rights from the state constitution, Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, is mostly skirting the issue. At <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/kansas-governor-debate-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent debate</a>, her Republican opponent, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, needled Kelly about her support for abortion rights, saying that Kelly didn’t support <em>any</em> limits on when abortion should be legal. Kelly responded with the equivalent of a shrug. “I really for 18 years have had the same position on this issue,” she said. “So I really don’t have much more to say.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelly’s silence on abortion shows that not all Democrats are convinced the issue can be deployed to their advantage, particularly in red-leaning states like Kansas. Instead, she’s been focusing on <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/05/kansas-governor-election-debate-laura-kelly-derek-schmidt-marijuana-crime/69529714007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy and education</a>, and <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/09/26/kansas-ads-in-governors-race-often-misleading-disparaging-with-a-partisan-dash-of-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tying Schmidt</a> to the unpopular former governor Sam Brownback. None of the <a href="https://www.washburn.edu/reference/cks/politics/ads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads run by Kelly’s campaign</a> have even mentioned the word “abortion.” And so far, it doesn’t look like a bad approach. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a>,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> Kelly is slightly favored, with a 66-in-100 chance of winning the election in November, even though she’s <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/this-years-most-vulnerable-incumbent-governors-are-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors</a> this cycle. And while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the polls we do have so far</a> show a tight race, <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/kansas-2022-democratic-governor-laura-kelly-in-tight-race-with-a-g-derek-schmidt-in-gubernatorial-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a September poll from Emerson College/The Hill</a> found that 53 percent of likely voters in Kansas have a favorable view of Kelly, while 45 percent view Schmidt favorably.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">There are a few reasons why it might be a smart strategy for a Democrat like Kelly to avoid a focus on abortion rights, even after the ballot initiative’s resounding defeat in August. For one thing, while other Democratic governors, like Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/04/politics/gretchen-whitmer-tudor-dixon-abortion-michigan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built a brand</a> around support for abortion rights, Kelly is different. “It’s not an issue she’s ever really focused on,” said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University-Camden and the director of the Center on American Women in Politics. Back in 2018, when Kelly was running against Republican Kris Kobach, she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-kris-kobachs-defeat-in-kansas-a-model-for-how-to-beat-trumpism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homed in on the same “kitchen-table issues”</a> she’s highlighting this time, similarly breaking with a larger national trend by refusing to engage with her opponent’s Trumpian rhetoric on immigration and voter fraud.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the time, that decision to stray from the national trend seemed to be a canny assessment of Kansas’s state politics. In races at the state or local level, voters may be less influenced by national issues and their own partisan identity. This is partially how Kelly was able to defeat Kobach by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/kansas-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a solid 5-percentage-point margin</a> in 2018, even though Trump won the state by double-digit margins in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/kansas-president-clinton-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-kansas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a>. Over the past decade or so, Republican presidential candidates have consistently won Kansas by double digits, but in 2014 and 2018, the gubernatorial margins were narrower.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This year, Kelly appears to be betting once again that what works for Democrats nationally won’t work for her in Kansas. After all, the fact that Kansans voted down an anti-abortion ballot amendment was never going to automatically translate into support for Democratic candidates. According to <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/abortion_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;home_state=Kansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling by Civiqs</a>, Kansans are only slightly more likely to think abortion should be legal in all or most cases (49 percent) than to think it should be illegal in all or most cases (47 percent). And the anti-amendment campaign’s advertising didn’t focus on abortion rights in redder, more rural parts of the state — instead, its ads <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/why-kansas-abortion-amendment-failed-even-in-rural-counties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrayed the amendment</a> as a government intrusion into Kansans’ freedom and bodily autonomy, similar to a mask mandate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because the Kansas amendment was the first opportunity for voters to weigh in on the issue in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning abortion rights, the anti-amendment campaign also benefited from a lot of national attention — and national money. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the course of 2022, the anti-amendment campaign pulled in more than $10.5 million<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total contributions include itemized and unitemized (including those under $50) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> in financial contributions, including some major out-of-state cash. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of campaign-finance filings from the two major groups on either side of the amendment, the vast majority (84 percent) of the anti-amendment donations of $50 or more<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the organization against the amendment, did not itemize donations under $50, which totaled $125,712, so we were unable to analyze where they came from. We calculated percentages based on dollar amounts, not the number of contributors, because contributors could donate more than once. A total of $52,970 came from donors who did not provide their addresses, so this was excluded from the analysis of contributions by state. In-kind contributions were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> came from donors with addresses outside Kansas, including one contribution of nearly $1.3 million from former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and another contribution of nearly $1.5 million from Sixteen Thirty Fund, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/17/dark-money-sixteen-thirty-fund-522781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left-leaning “dark money” group</a>. By contrast, nearly $1.7 million came from donors with addresses inside Kansas.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The pro-amendment campaign, meanwhile, raised less money — nearly $6.7 million<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total contributions include donations under $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> in financial contributions, according to its last report — but almost all of it (99 percent) came from donors with addresses in Kansas.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a direct comparison with donations to Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, we excluded donations to Value Them Both, the main organization supporting the amendment, under $50, which totaled $54,114 plus an additional $120 in unitemized contributions (denoted as “$50 or less”). A total of $17,495 in contributions came from donors who did not provide their addresses, so this was excluded from the analysis of contributions by state. In-kind contributions were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> That included some large donations, too, such as one contribution of nearly $1.3 million from the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archdiocese made multiple contributions of at least $350,000, excluding in-kind contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> and one contribution of $300,000 from the Catholic Diocese of Wichita,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diocese made multiple contributions ranging from hundreds of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> so it’s hard to say whether one side had more grassroots support in Kansas than the other. What is clear from this data, however, is that the anti-amendment campaign’s large cash advantage was fueled mainly by out-of-state donors, not by a surge in financial support from within Kansas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s other evidence, too, that abortion rights simply aren’t a big priority for Kansas voters in the upcoming midterm elections. According to that Emerson College poll, 48 percent of likely voters say the economy is the most important issue in the election, followed by a much smaller share (16 percent) who say abortion is the most important. The poll also found that only 72 percent of Kansans who voted “no” on the amendment (i.e., those in favor of preserving abortion rights in the state constitution) are planning to vote for Kelly, showing that support for a Democratic governor and opposition to the amendment aren’t linked for some voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it makes some sense for Kelly to break with the nationwide trend and steer clear of the issue of abortion rights. Whether it’s a good idea for Schmidt to bring up the issue, however, is a different question. The Emerson College poll found that Kansas voters are actually more likely to say they align most with Kelly on abortion rights (48 percent) than with Schmidt (44 percent). It’s possible, therefore, that Schmidt might benefit from taking a page out of Kelly’s playbook and focus on matters like the economy instead of attacking her on an issue that isn’t a high priority for voters — <em>and</em> that he doesn’t have the advantage on.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This November, Vermont voters <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look very likely</a> to reelect Republican Gov. Phil Scott <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/vermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and to send</a> Democratic Rep. Peter Welch to the U.S. Senate. Considering the candidates, the partisan disconnect between these two major statewide races might not seem shocking. After all, Scott ranks as <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/11/whitmers-approval-ticks-up-in-michigan-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the nation’s most popular governors</a> and Welch has served as Vermont’s lone House member for eight terms, <a href="https://electionarchive.vermont.gov/elections/search/year_from:2006/year_to:2020/office_id:5/stage:General" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easily winning reelection over and over again</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the larger context of the 2022 midterm elections and national political trends, Vermont couldn’t be stranger. That’s because the voting margins in the Senate and governor races of most other states won’t differ that much, thanks to a decreasing tendency for voters to back one party’s candidate in one race and the other party’s candidate in another — an electoral phenomenon known as casting a <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/split-ticket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split-ticket</a> vote. While there will still be at least minor differences in these races, nowadays most voters <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to fall in line</a> behind either the Democratic or Republican candidates, making it more likely that a state’s election results for Senate and governor will look pretty similar.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This November, 26 states have both a Senate and a governor’s race, and using the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight midterm forecast’s</a> average margin from each contest, we can project just how close the races in 24 of those states will run together.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of a special election, Oklahoma has two Senate races with its single gubernatorial election, so we actually have 25 cases as we compare Oklahoma’s governor’s race to each Senate contest. We excluded Oregon and Alaska from this analysis because Oregon independent Betsy Johnson &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;looks likely to win&lt;/a&gt; more than 10 percent of the vote in the state’s &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;governor’s race&lt;/a&gt;, which complicates comparing the forecast margin to Oregon’s &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Senate contest&lt;/a&gt;; and because multiple candidates from the same party are running in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alaska’s Senate race&lt;/a&gt; and a high-profile independent, former Gov. Bill Walker, is also running in the state’s gubernatorial contest. Projected margins are from our Deluxe forecast as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern on Oct. 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a> In Vermont, we estimate Welch should win by roughly 23 percentage points over his Republican opponent, while we expect Scott to defeat his Democratic opponent by about 24 points, putting those races a whopping 47 points apart. But Vermont is tracking to be an outlier: Our forecast’s median difference between the margins in a state’s Senate and governor races is only a bit more than 6 points (Pennsylvania), as the table below shows.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the median rather than the average across these states and races because we don’t have a large sample size, which makes outlier results like Vermont’s more likely to skew an average and potentially understate the amount of straight-ticket voting going on these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> That median difference would be the lowest in a midterm election in over three decades, indicative of how split-ticket voting has declined as a result of the increased polarization and nationalization of American politics.</p>

 <p>“Open” indicates that the incumbent senator or governor is not running for reelection. Some numbers may not add up due to rounding. The forecast margin is based on FiveThirtyEight’s “Deluxe” model as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on Oct. 11.</p>
 <p>Includes only races where both a Democrat and Republican are running, and excludes races with a major independent candidate projected to win at least 10 percent. Because of a special election, Oklahoma has two Senate elections, so we compared each to the state’s single governor’s race.</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Now, Vermonters wouldn’t be completely alone in sizably splitting votes in their Senate and governor races. Next door, New Hampshire looks <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very likely to reelect</a> Republican Gov. Chris Sununu while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also probably reelecting</a> Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. In Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is locked in a tight reelection battle</a> in what is otherwise a red state, but Republican Sen. Jerry Moran <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should handily win reelection</a>. (These states are notable in that the incumbents are of different parties — more on that later.) But we expect to see a single-digit difference between the Senate and governor races in most states. In some cases, that might even mean nearly zero variation, as our projected vote margin for Nevada shows both Democratic incumbents running in essentially dead heats. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, should the 2022 results in these states mirror our projected vote margins — and they largely did in 2018 — this midterm will likely feature the smallest median gap between concurrent Senate and gubernatorial races in midterms dating back to 1990.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at midterm elections not only because 2022 is a midterm, but because 36 of the 50 states elect governors in midterms, so midterms are where the concurrent Senate-governor elections mostly occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> The 2022 estimated median would be even lower than the 2018 median, which had already set a modern record with a median difference of about 10 points. The overall decline in split-ticket voting isn’t limited to only Senate and governor races, either: In 2020, most Senate and House races <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t differ markedly</a> from the presidential vote in their state or district. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Fewer voters back different parties for Senate and governor" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/I57mV/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="471" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://youtu.be/uPnfuczOWb8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We’re not in 1990 anymore</a>, Toto, thanks to forces driving voters to more uniformly back a single party. The Democratic and Republican parties <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have grown farther apart ideologically</a>, and voters <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/the-partisan-landscape-and-views-of-the-parties/#fn-20071486-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are increasingly likely to say</a> that there are sizable differences between the parties. At the same time, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/interactives/political-polarization-1994-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters’ political views have also become more polarized</a>, with more Democrats becoming consistently liberal and more Republicans becoming more consistently conservative. And because of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative partisanship</a>, voters are now more inclined to dislike the other party out of hand, making them less likely to consider voting for a candidate from the opposite party under any condition. These developments have left the country with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/just-how-many-swing-voters-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer swing voters than ever</a>; despite the large number of Americans who claim to be independent, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-americans-who-identify-as-independent-are-actually-independent-thats-really-bad-for-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most in fact prefer one side</a>. More broadly, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18792694?journalCode=aprb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics are more nationalized</a>, which has reduced regional variation in elections for Senate or governor, making it less likely that ruby-red Alabama will elect a Democratic governor (<a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1998&amp;fips=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last happened in 1998</a>) or that deep-blue New York will elect a Republican senator (<a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=36&amp;year=1992&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;class=3&amp;elect=0&amp;minper=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last happened in 1992</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other factors such as incumbency also play into the differences between Senate and gubernatorial margins. While incumbency <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912919883696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not as powerful a boost</a> as it once was, we still expect incumbents to perform better than non-incumbents. In races where different parties have incumbents defending the Senate and governor seats, you’ll tend to see a larger gap, like in Georgia, Kansas or New Hampshire, as the appeal of each incumbent will encourage voters to split their tickets. You’ll also see some sizable differences in states where one race doesn’t have an incumbent, such as Ohio and Vermont, as the absence of the incumbency advantage in one race can mean the national environment and partisan baseline of the state will exert a stronger influence on its result. By contrast, in states with incumbents from the same party in both races, you’ll generally see smaller differences between the two.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Important state-to-state differences can come into play here, too. A decade ago, FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/swing-voters-and-elastic-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced the concept</a> of “elastic” and “inelastic” states, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refers to how sensitive a state is</a> to changes in the national political environment and the relative swinginess of the state. We’d expect a more elastic state to have more variation in its voting preferences from year to year, and more variation from race to race in the same year. In the table below, we lay out FiveThirtyEight’s elasticity scores by state, which are used in our forecast. Tellingly, New Hampshire and Vermont are right near the top of the list.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Together, these national, state and candidate forces can influence how many voters split tickets for Senate and governor. Despite the recent decline in split-ticket voting, however, the small share of voters who do split their votes remains critically important. Take Georgia, a pretty inelastic state that currently projects to have about an 8-point difference between its Senate and gubernatorial races, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would rank as one of the state’s largest gaps</a> in recent memory. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who leads in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average</a> by roughly 6 points, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks more certain</a> to win <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock</a>, who <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads by about 4 points</a>. But <em>if</em> that gap largely holds, it probably makes a Warnock victory more likely because it suggests at least a few Georgia voters plan to split their votes between Warnock and Kemp. If the gap narrows, however, the races are more likely to run closely together, which could help Republicans win both races in what remains a somewhat GOP-leaning state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we get closer to Election Day, many factors will affect how these races play out, and even if the number of split-ticket voters is smaller, they can still shape who wins the Senate and gubernatorial contests in these states. So watch how big or small these gaps prove to be on Election Day, as they’ll tell us more about just how willing voters are to back different parties for major offices, a sign of just how partisan things could become.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">During the reapportionment process after the 2020 census, Colorado was awarded an additional congressional district, giving it a total of eight. This new district was designed <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as fairly competitive</a> and indeed has the hallmarks of being tough to predict in November: The southern part of the district encompasses a portion of the Denver suburbs and includes a <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/data/colorados-8th-congressional-district-will-be-the-most-competitive-hispanic-in-the-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large Latino population</a>, who <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2016/10/11/latinos-and-the-political-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically supports Democrats</a>, while its northern counties are much more rural and Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this district isn’t a pure toss-up. The 8th District leans very slightly<em> </em>toward the GOP, with a partisan lean of R+3,<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> and right now, Republican candidate Barbara Kirkmeyer has a more than 2-in-3 chance of capturing the Centennial State’s newest district, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/colorado/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> And this district has a few quirks that could make it a winner for the GOP, including its demographics, each party’s candidates and national interest in the race. As a result, this district could be another disappointment for Democrats — who are expected, at least by our metrics, to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose control of the U.S. House</a> following this year’s midterm elections. Let’s break down why this brand-new district is currently looking to be a red one this fall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We have only <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/house/2022/colorado/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one internal poll</a> of the race, sponsored by Democrat Yadira Caraveo, and it gives Kirkmeyer a 2-percentage-point edge. But <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2022/07/29/colorado-congress-2022-election-republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since late summer</a>, a handful of political prognosticators (including us) have moved the race more squarely in Republicans’ column.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This new district represents what is likely to be the state’s most hotly contested race — in part due to its politics and demographics. According to FiveThirtyEight data, Latino Americans make <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up nearly 35 percent of the district’s voting-age population</a> — the largest percentage for any congressional seat in the state. Typically, Latino voters favor Democrats, but it’s not clear yet whether Caraveo will benefit much from the district’s racial and ethnic makeup. In fact, voters in the district backed Democrat John Hickenlooper for Senate by <a href="https://redistricting.colorado.gov/content/congressional-final-approved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a margin of just 1.7 points</a> back in 2020, according to calculations from the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commissions. (For comparison, Hickenlooper won the state by a margin of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/colorado-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.3 points</a>.) </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The Redistricting Commissions <a href="https://redistricting.colorado.gov/content/congressional-final-approved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared results from eight recent statewide elections</a> to see how voters in the new district cast their ballots. As you can see, the 8th District is far from a stronghold for either party. Recent elections have flipped from one party to another depending on the race and consistently feature narrow margins.</p>

The district encompasses the northern suburbs of Denver, which tend to go blue, Acevedo told us, but it also includes <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2021/01/19/not-going-away-weld-county-republicans-consider-next-steps-as-democrats-take-power-in-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the conservative Weld County</a>. In contrast, he added, parts of the southernmost areas of the district are <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/latinos-largest-community-in-commerce-city-and-adams-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predominantly Latino, Democratic-leaning and low-income</a> — but it’s not a guarantee that Democrats will win this bloc. “This is where the parties have to do the work to go in and try to motivate those voters to cast ballots in their favor,” Acevedo said. “And it’s not clear to me that the Democratic Party is doing the work that’s needed.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/07/05/unaffiliated-voters-colorado-2022-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much like a significant chunk of voters in Colorado</a>, a <a href="https://redistricting.colorado.gov/content/congressional-final-approved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high share of registered voters</a> in the district (46 percent) are unaffiliated with either major political party.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data from the state&amp;#8217;s redistricting commission, as of Sept. 1, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> Of the remaining electorate, about half are registered Republicans (24 percent) or Democrats (27 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The district’s fairly even split in registration wasn’t an accident. Since 2018, the state has had an <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/colorado/?cycle=2020&amp;level=Congress&amp;startdate=2021-11-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission</a> that draws new district maps, which are then approved by the state Supreme Court. This means that Colorado’s Democratic-controlled state legislature wasn’t able to draw the new district in its favor, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/ron-desantis-drew-florida-an-extreme-gerrymander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve seen in other states</a>. Along with the addition of the new competitive district, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current map maintains</a> the old map’s four Democratic-leaning seats and three Republican-leaning seats, and has a very low efficiency gap, which suggests that few votes are wasted. Given that the party <em>not</em> in control of the White House <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tends to do better</a> in midterms, Republicans stand to benefit in this race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the high concentration of unaffiliated voters means moderation is key. An extreme candidate from either party is going to <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/11/16/colorado-new-congressional-district-go-moderate-to-win-8th-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a harder time winning here</a>, and both Kirkmeyer and Caraveo seem to have taken that to heart. Kirkmeyer is one of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minority of Republican candidates</a> who has <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/07/colorado-8th-congressional-district-republicans-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicitly denied former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims</a> of a stolen election in 2020. And while she previously promoted strict anti-abortion views, Kirkmeyer has started distancing herself from them, including <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2022/08/31/kirkmeyer-removes-abortion-campaign-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrubbing anti-abortion language</a> from her website. On the offensive side, Kirkmeyer has <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2022/watch-republican-barb-kirkmeyer-defends-oil-and-gas-industry-in-new-tv-ad-in-colorados/article_79b72a00-361b-11ed-b275-c3949c6db72c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likened her opponent</a> to progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Republicans have <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2022/04/07/no-wonder-dems-are-worried-about-co-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted a past endorsement</a> of Caraveo from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, Caraveo and her allies have repeatedly tried to needle Kirkmeyer on her abortion stance. One ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/watch-democrats-slam-kirkmeyer-over-gop-candidates-support-for-national-abortion-ban-in-new-tv/article_3fa11e0a-3e79-11ed-96f0-ffac168e2e1e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured a clip</a> of Kirkmeyer saying she “[doesn’t] agree to any exceptions to abortion,” though the Republican has <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/politics/truth-tests/truth-test-kirkmeyer-ad-cd8-election/73-488f2601-35aa-4bf6-99e5-f1b65c14649f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently endorsed one exception</a> — if the mother’s life is in danger. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But persuading voters that Kirkmeyer is a GOP extremist might be a hard sell. That’s partly because prominent Democratic groups did the opposite when they <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/16/8th-congressional-district-tv-ad-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran ads during the GOP primary</a>, attacking Kirkmeyer for not being reliably conservative. In fact, the party essentially propped up Weld County Commissioner Lori Saine, <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/06/14/8th-congressional-district-republican-primary-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a conservative firebrand</a> who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/28/us/elections/results-colorado-us-house-district-8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handily defeated</a> by Kirkmeyer in the district’s primary. (To be clear, this isn’t the first time Democrats’ involvement in a Colorado race didn’t go as planned. The party <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/09/dems-meddle-in-colorado-senate-gop-primary-00038294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented a similar tactic</a> in the GOP primary for U.S. Senate, and voters ended up choosing the more conventional GOP candidate there, too.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, the national Republican Party has heavily boosted Kirkmeyer’s candidacy. Last month, the National Republican Congressional Committee <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2022/house-republicans-book-2-6-million-in-fall-tv-ads-in-colorados-new-congressional-district/article_92686900-3054-11ed-8645-cb1b5c8e75a4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was buying $2.6 million in television advertising in the district. The Democratic House Majority PAC <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/us/politics/house-democrats-midterms-advertising.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also investing in this race</a>, but it’s primarily focusing ads in the Denver market, likely with the goal of getting out the vote in the reliably blue area. And outside spending for Kirkmeyer has eclipsed <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=CO08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caraveo’s fundraising haul</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, this race is no slam dunk for Kirkmeyer. Beyond politics and PAC money, the race might also come down to the hot-button issues 8th District voters prioritize as they head to the ballot box. The salience of these issues, like abortion access, especially following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to abortion, could boost Caraveo. A recent poll from <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2022/08/31/poll-colorado-latino-voters-support-abortion-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnidosUS/Mi Familia Vota/BSP Research</a> found that an overwhelming majority of Latino voters in Colorado (74 percent) believed that abortion should remain legal, regardless of their personal beliefs on the matter. The flip side is that <em>other</em> issues are more important to Latinos in Colorado, <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/housing-costs-top-list-of-colorado-voters-concerns-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like inflation</a> (their No. 1 issue, according to the poll), which could help Kirkmeyer since voters tend to trust Republicans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/03/economy-inflation-top-of-mind-for-midterm-voters-giving-gop-slight-edge-in-new-monmouth-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more on economic issues</a>.<strong> </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the end, the outcome of Colorado’s newest district may not come down to anything more complicated than the fact that it’s a toss-up seat in a midterm election environment that favors Republicans. Mystery solved.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Want to influence state laws and elections? Attorney general or secretary of state is the job for you! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the U.S., the attorney general is a state’s top law-enforcement official, and the secretary of state is the head election official in most states. Secretaries of state became part of the mainstream consciousness when former President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the 2020 election was rigged against him. The office is typically responsible for implementing a state’s voting procedures and certifying elections. Meanwhile, attorneys general are the ones who decide whether to <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/wi-attorney-general-says-he-will-not-enforce-abortion-ban-if-roe-v-wade-overturned/40399979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enforce an abortion ban</a> or file a lawsuit against President Biden’s administration to block policies on <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/28/texas-paxton-lawsuit-biden-asylum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration reform</a>, <a href="https://wpde.com/news/local/sc-attorney-general-alan-wilson-17-state-coalition-suing-biden-administration-protect-second-amendment-gun-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gun control</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/09/29/republicans-student-loan-forgiveness-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">student-loan forgiveness</a>.<br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The majority of attorney-general and secretary-of-state offices are on the ballot in 2022, 30 of the former and 27 of the latter. But we think only 20 of these races are worth keeping an eye on. That’s because the others are mostly either safely Republican or safely Democratic.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exception is the Wisconsin secretary of state election. We aren’t watching that race since the office is largely ceremonial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> Many of these races could also determine the future of voting rights and abortion access in many parts of the U.S. And while we don’t forecast attorney general and secretary of state races like we do for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House, Senate and governor</a>, we’ll have updates on some of these races between now and Election Day. But first, here’s a lay of the land.</p>



<h2><strong>The closest races</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <strong>Nevada</strong> secretary of state’s race is one of the closest in the country. The most recent poll, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/politics/cnn-poll-arizona-nevada-senate-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a>, found that 46 percent of likely voters favored former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, the Republican candidate, and 43 percent supported attorney Cisco Aguilar, the Democrat — within the survey’s margin of error. Aguilar has also raised more than twice as much as Marchant (<a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/soscandidateservices/anonymousaccess/ViewCCEReport.aspx?syn=KDRMWFhEtgNdct%252b7gZqzBg%253d%253d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.1 million</a> to <a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/soscandidateservices/anonymousaccess/ViewCCEReport.aspx?syn=iNHRjYR2mLvolDzfd4fT6w%253d%253d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$437,000</a>) to help close that gap. Marchant, meanwhile, is one of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven election deniers</a> running for secretary of state nationwide<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The others are Chuck Gray of Wyoming (almost certain to win), H. Brooke Paige of Vermont (almost certain to lose) and four candidates we’ll introduce later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> and arguably one of the most extreme. He <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/29/election-denier-secretary-state-mail-voting-00054018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposes electronic voting machines</a> and has said he wants to “wipe out the voter rolls completely and then have everybody re-register,” which would be illegal. He also believes that elections have been rigged for <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-debates-secretary-of-state-candidates-cast-wildly-different-visions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades</a> despite all evidence to the contrary.</p>

By contrast, Democratic candidate Adrian Fontes, the former top election official of Arizona’s largest county, aggressively tried to <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2020/03/13/maricopa-county-mailing-ballots-democratic-presidential-preference-tuesday-election-coronavirus/5044933002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand voting access</a> in 2020.

And Finchem has handily outraised Fontes <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2023%7COfficeID=2010%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million to $700,000</a>. Still, the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State is planning to <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2022/09/29/national-democrats-spend-big-arizona-support-adrian-fontes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend millions</a> on the race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Several races for attorney general are also too close to identify a leader. In Arizona, an average of two partisan surveys (<a href="https://endcitizensunited.org/latest-news/press-releases/new-arizona-poll-attorney-general-and-secretary-of-state-races-are-neck-and-neck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one Democratic</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AZ-Gen-0918-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one Republican</a>) from mid-September gave Republican attorney Abraham Hamadeh a 4.5-point lead. Hamadeh, 31, is a political novice who has also made <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/15/abe-hamadeh-kris-mayes-answer-criticisms-arizona-attorney-general-race/10391364002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Semitic remarks</a>. His Democratic opponent Kris Mayes, a former <em>Republican</em> member of the Arizona Corporation Commission, has both experience and potential crossover appeal. But both Hamadeh and Mayes have raised the same amount of money, <a href="https://seethemoney.az.gov/#JurisdictionId=0%7CPage=1%7CstartYear=2021%7CendYear=2023%7COfficeID=2020%7CIsLessActive=false%7CShowOfficeHolder=false%7CView=Detail%7CTablePage=1%7CTableLength=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.0 million</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Kansas</strong> has an R+21 <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/partisan-lean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a>,<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> but the state’s attorney general race is nonetheless competitive. Republicans have nominated a weak candidate in former Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Kobach’s <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-kansas-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed crusade against voter fraud</a> got him in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/18/603810241/federal-judge-holds-kris-kobach-in-contempt-of-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal hot water</a> in 2018. As a result, he is an <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/07/07/polling-for-ag-candidate-tony-mattivi-reveals-hidden-appeal-among-gop-voters-for-a-crimefighter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular figure</a> statewide. A <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/kansas-2022-democratic-governor-laura-kelly-in-tight-race-with-a-g-derek-schmidt-in-gubernatorial-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> put Kobach and former police officer Chris Mann, the Democratic candidate, in a virtual tie, with 41 percent of likely Kansas voters supporting Kobach and 39 percent supporting Mann.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the <strong>Iowa</strong> attorney general’s race is a direct clash between tradition and change. Democratic incumbent Tom Miller has served for 38 years and is the longest-serving attorney general in U.S. history. But Iowa has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/something-funny-happened-in-iowa-and-it-may-hurt-democrats-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved</a> into a Republican-leaning state over the past decade. Guthrie County Attorney Brenna Bird, the Republican candidate, hopes that 2022 will be the year that the power of partisanship is finally greater than Miller’s personal brand. The <a href="https://taxrelief.org/poll-strong-support-for-republicans-voters-focused-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> put Bird at 46 percent and Miller at 43 percent. The poll, however, was sponsored by a pro-Republican group, so it may have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too generous to the GOP</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Swing-state <strong>Georgia</strong> will not have an election denier running its 2024 election. In May, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/raffensperger-wins-republican-primary-for-georgia-secretary-of-state/NDTWJ5JHGBEK3KI6MSWZ5NGPXY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated</a> his Trump-endorsed challenger in the Republican primary. Raffensperger’s famous refusal to “<a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/01/03/trump-georgia-election-officials-i-just-want-find-11780-votes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find 11,780 votes</a>” to flip Georgia to Trump in 2020 earned him <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1334509428549312512?s=20&amp;t=4hsReRVo1RUSwL-Ezso_Ig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan respect</a>. That should help him defeat Democratic state Rep. Bee Nguyen in November. An average of two <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-trump-target-raffensperger-dominating-race-for-reelection/2UNCKODYAJASHFGLIRP7T6EA7A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=e363ce46-6a44-4584-9c5b-3c271473b1ba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> gave Raffensperger an 11-point lead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the Georgia attorney general’s race, Republican incumbent Chris Carr rejected Trump’s false claims of voter fraud, but that campaign has <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2022/09/07/georgia-attorney-general-race-carr-jordan-battle-over-abortion-voting-issues/7945225001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused more on abortion</a>. Carr has defended Georgia’s six-week abortion ban in court. His Democratic opponent, state Sen. Jen Jordan, meanwhile, first rose to prominence with an emotional speech opposing the law in the legislature. According to those same two polls, Carr has an average lead of 7 points for now, but Georgia is a competitive state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a similar story in <strong>Florida</strong>, another perennially competitive state. We can’t write it off completely, but it’s hard to imagine Attorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican, losing to former state Attorney Aramis Ayala, the Democratic candidate. Moody led a <a href="https://cloudup.com/iWr3mJo7Brk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Mason-Dixon poll</a> by 13 points and has raised <a href="https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/campaign-finance/contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.0 million</a> compared to Ayala’s <a href="https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/campaign-finance/contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$162,000</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, <strong>Texas</strong> Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, has made a lot of bad headlines over the years. In 2015, he was <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2015/08/03/paxton-set-surrender-securities-fraud-indictment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicted</a> for alleged security fraud (charges that have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/years-trial-texas-ag-ken-paxton-84903414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still not gone to trial</a>). In 2020, the FBI reportedly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ken-paxton-austin-texas-crime-f8413d14842d848e69cf81bb4d2e87e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started investigating him</a> on unrelated bribery allegations and using his office to benefit a wealthy donor. He was also a leading figure in the <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-sues-battleground-states-unconstitutional-changes-2020-election-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> seeking to overturn the 2020 election in four swing states. That all has made him one of the most endangered Texas Republicans in the 2022 election. But Texas is still Texas. No Democrat has won any statewide office in the Lone Star State <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1REYGxQTXblXMHmWuyRiYbbaRlhezrFmMfyNJQwGioYU/edit#gid=711118416" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1994</a>. According to a <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Spectrum-Texas-Sept-2022-PR-Draft-7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siena College and Spectrum News</a> poll, Paxton led Democratic attorney Rochelle Garza 47 percent to 42 percent among likely Texas voters.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1229437484-3x2-1.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1229437484-3x2-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1229437484-3x2-1.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1229437484-3x2-1.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson enjoys a fundraising and polling lead over her challenger, GOP nominee Kristina Karamo. <p>KENT NISHIMURA / LOS ANGELES TIMES / GETTY IMAGES</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Where Democrats are favored</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The first two races in this category could be considered toss-ups. But, as things stand today, we think Democrats have an identifiable advantage. While we couldn’t find a single poll of the <strong>Wisconsin</strong> attorney general’s race, which could <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/14/wisconsin-attorney-general-election-candidates-abortion-law-after-roe-v-wade-overturned/7755800001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determine the fate of abortion rights</a> in the Badger State, Democratic incumbent Josh Kaul has raised <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0105879SeptemberReport202241cb09272022100539PMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 million</a>, compared to the <a href="https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0106408SeptemberReport2022452a99272022113910PMCF-2Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$249,000</a> raised by Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney, a Republican. Similarly, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FMgbnIJWR3zoCnMfSk9ft4EcHQOuJ_Q5/edit#gid=644494231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only</a> <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/587943724/RGJ-Suffolk-Poll-Cross-Tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> of the <strong>Nevada</strong> attorney general’s election have an unhelpfully large number of undecided voters. But Democratic incumbent Aaron Ford has raised <a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/soscandidateservices/anonymousaccess/ViewCCEReport.aspx?syn=dTVlO%252fJybY8Kns9ofc4h4w%253d%253d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.9 million</a> compared to the $666,000 raised by attorney Sigal Chattah, the Republican candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, the two races in <strong>Michigan</strong> are arguably solidly Democratic. However, we’re still watching them since Michigan has a purple hue. Incumbent Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, has raised <a href="https://cfrsearch.nictusa.com/documents/531660/details/filing/summary?changes=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.2 million</a> compared to Republican Kristina Karamo’s <a href="https://cfrsearch.nictusa.com/documents/531875/details/filing/summary?changes=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$907,000</a>. Benson also led by an average of 12 points in <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2022/10/04/nessel-benson-widen-leads-over-republican-challengers-struggling-with-name-id/69535428007/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three</a> <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MI-Gen-Gov-Poll-Report-0930.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://ssl2002.webhosting.comcast.net/epic-mra/press/Statewide_Sept2022_Media_Freq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a>. Karamo, a former community college professor, is another <a href="https://boltsmag.org/kristina-karamo-has-plans-to-unwind-michigan-elections-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-blown election denier</a> seeking to be her state’s top election official. She could use the office to make it harder to vote or to investigate voter-fraud claims, which would be referred to the attorney general for prosecution. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The GOP candidate in the race for Michigan attorney general is also an election denier: Attorney Matthew DePerno legally challenged the 2020 results in Michigan’s Antrim County and is <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/deperno-others-linked-vote-machine-tampering-case-headed-special-prosecutor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under investigation</a> (at the request of his opponent, Democratic incumbent Dana Nessel) for allegedly tampering with voting machines. But he’ll have a hard time defeating Nessel. She has raised $4.2 million compared to <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/26/nessel-maintains-big-fundraising-lead-over-deperno-in-ag-race/69519843007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DePerno’s $763,000</a> and leads by 10 points in <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2022/10/04/nessel-benson-widen-leads-over-republican-challengers-struggling-with-name-id/69535428007/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those</a> <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MI-Gen-Gov-Poll-Report-0930.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three</a> <a href="https://ssl2002.webhosting.comcast.net/epic-mra/press/Statewide_Sept2022_Media_Freq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The threat to democracy may be more severe in <strong>Minnesota</strong>. The North Star State has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 straight elections</a>. But Kim Crockett, the Republican candidate for secretary of state who has <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/05/25/minnesota-gop-endorses-election-denier-to-oversee-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called the 2020 election rigged</a>, trails Democratic incumbent Steve Simon just 45 percent to 42 percent in an average of <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/kstp-surveyusa-poll-3-statewide-races-all-toss-ups-with-a-month-to-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three</a> <a href="https://alphanews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MN-Gen-Poll-Report-0918.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-poll-results-attorney-general-secretary-of-state-ellison-schultz-marijuana-sports-betting/600207474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a>. That said, Democrats are throwing money at this race: Simon has raised <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/campaign-finance/candidates/17653/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a>, and Democratic outside groups have committed <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/elections/2022/10/so-much-for-a-sleepy-secretary-of-state-race-simon-crockett-contest-attracts-national-headlines-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 million more</a> to TV ads. Crockett, by contrast, has raised a total of <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/campaign-finance/candidates/18732/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$323,000</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The better opportunity for Minnesota Republicans may be the race for attorney general. It was the state’s closest statewide election in 2018, and Democratic incumbent Keith Ellison’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/09/05/george-floyd-reckoning-democrat-crime-00054711" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been targeted</a> for his outspoken progressivism. In an average of the three recent polls of Minnesota voters, Ellison and Republican Jim Schultz, an attorney, are tied at 46 percent each. However, Ellison has raised <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/campaign-finance/candidates/18336/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.4 million</a> compared to Schultz’s <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/campaign-finance/candidates/18731/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$885,000</a>. That, along with his incumbency and Minnesota’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-minnesota-could-be-the-next-midwestern-state-to-go-red/?ex_cid=story-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light-blue hue</a>, gives Ellison a boost.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans are getting frisky in a few other light-blue states too, though probably not enough to win. In <strong>New Mexico</strong>, Republican Jeremy Gay, a Marine veteran, recently released a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9txbf7moig62386/Jeremy%20Gay%20Polling%20Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cygnal poll</a> that showed him statistically tied with Bernalillo County District Attorney Raúl Torrez, a Democrat, in the attorney general’s race. But internal polls tend to be too good to be true, and Torrez has raised <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/index.html#/exploreDetails/FuFj2UgZv9jij3XuwDf9pn1lK5MpzTLbNw12UnzEQ-I1/10/0/119/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.6 million</a> compared to Gay’s <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/index.html#/exploreDetails/DdAjvqiu3qyEIk2cwywqVX1lK5MpzTLbNw12UnzEQ-I1/10/0/119/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$344,000</a>. Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, has pulled in a less impressive <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/index.html#/exploreDetails/i6Rr92sWQ8pC8ve8W5XvmH1lK5MpzTLbNw12UnzEQ-I1/7/0/119/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$466,000</a>. But her Republican opponent, small-business owner Audrey Trujillo, has just <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/index.html#/exploreDetails/JKb4_A7zBxBu3QBTwm6lkX1lK5MpzTLbNw12UnzEQ-I1/7/0/119/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$73,000</a> in contributions. Trujillo has also shared a plethora of <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2022/10/04/experts-alarmed-by-gop-secretary-of-state-candidates-conspiracy-theorizing-in-nm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conspiracy theories</a> about the 2020 election, COVID-19 vaccines, mass shootings and Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the Republican candidates in <strong>Colorado</strong> are more moderate. District Attorney John Kellner, running for attorney general, says he would <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/08/10/attorney-general-republican-candidate-john-kellner-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect abortion access in the state</a>, while former Jefferson County Clerk Pam Anderson, running for secretary of state, has said that the 2020 election was <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/08/2022-republican-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free and fair</a>. But <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?SeqID=52137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither</a> has <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?Type=CA&amp;SeqID=52902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> more than $300,000, so they’ll probably need a “red wave” to carry them across the finish line. Democratic incumbents Attorney General Phil Weiser and Secretary of State Jena Griswold have each raised <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?SeqID=47921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around</a> <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?SeqID=47921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 million</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, no Republican is running for secretary of state in <strong>Washington</strong>, but Democrats could still lose. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/inslee-selects-sen-steve-hobbs-to-temporarily-replace-wyman-as-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed</a> incumbent Steve Hobbs, the first Democrat to hold the office since 1964, after Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman resigned to join the Biden administration. So this will be the first time voters weigh in on Hobbs, who is running against Pierce County Auditor Julie Anderson, an independent. Anderson has <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/sep/25/candidates-for-washington-secretary-of-state-disag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two key advantages</a>. She has experience as the top election administrator of Washington’s second-largest county, and she’s not a Republican, which could make more people willing to vote for her in this blue state. That said, Hobbs is still the one with the “D” beside his name, and he’s outraised Anderson to boot, <a href="https://www.pdc.wa.gov/political-disclosure-reporting-data/browse-search-data/candidates/567322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$640,000</a> to <a href="https://www.pdc.wa.gov/political-disclosure-reporting-data/browse-search-data/candidates/567378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$298,000</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Crossing the northern border suddenly looked a lot more tempting on June 24. When the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/06/demonstrators-converge-outside-supreme-court-after-dobbs-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released its ruling</a> in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization at 10:10 that morning — invalidating its landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade — Google searches for “how to move to Canada from U.S.” <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/06/25/after-the-ruling-americans-ask-google-how-to-move-to-canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spiked 850 percent</a> in the hour afterward, according to Simon Rogers’s Google Trends newsletter. And queries on “how to become a Canadian citizen” jumped 550 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Amidst the chaos and emotion of the Dobbs decision, this trend marked the reemergence of a common American sentiment: the threat to pack up and head to Canada when political events don’t turn out one’s way. In 2016, Democrats famously vowed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/move-to-canada-trump-election-immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leave if Donald Trump won</a> the presidency, and the pattern goes back further, during <a href="https://time.com/4245100/move-to-canada-americans-trump-bush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George W. Bush’s time in office</a>, for example. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.timesherald.com/2008/11/14/yes-we-canada-republicans-consider-move-north/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservatives eyed the nation to the north</a> <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/disgruntled-americans-threaten-move-canada-obama-victory-062354107.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after Barack Obama was elected</a> president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, nearly 2 in 5 American citizens (38 percent) say they’ve considered leaving the U.S. for good at least at some point in their lives, according to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/g43s025yft/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a YouGov survey</a> conducted in January. That share rises to 45 percent among Americans under 45 and to 59 percent among self-identified liberals. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the fall of Roe may have spurred interest in Canada, it ultimately turned abortion into a state-by-state issue, meaning Americans don’t have to leave the country to live somewhere with better access to reproductive health care. Instead, media coverage has suggested that the issue could affect movement between<em> </em>states, with stories speculating how the decision might determine where young Americans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/how-roes-end-is-changing-millennials-career-plans-and-lives.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settle down</a>, large corporations <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2022/06/24/how-the-tech-landscape-could-change-if-abortion-laws-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establish their offices</a> and college students <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/07/22/state-abortion-access-college-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attend school</a>. But recent history has shown that politically driven mass migration in the U.S. is more a conversation topic than an actual trend. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><hr><span></span></div>
 



<p data-paragraph="main">Data suggests that most past pledges to move to Canada didn’t pan out. For example, after Trump’s election in 2016, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/reports-statistics/statistics-open-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a>, which tracks immigration into the country, found that only 655 more Americans gained permanent residence in Canada in 2017 than in 2016 — that’s just 9,140 people versus 8,485. And while 2018 numbers ticked up slightly to 10,900, they generally plateaued in 2019. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">To be fair, <a href="https://www.move.org/moving-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving can be expensive</a> — on the order of thousands of dollars, even for a local relocation, according to industry experts — making this an unfeasible option for many Americans. Uprooting your everyday life to potentially gain access to a specific kind of health care isn’t an investment a lot of people can make. And those who can afford to do so are also more likely to be able to travel across state lines in a health care emergency, making the case to move in light of stricter abortion laws less urgent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even when Americans do move, they don’t go far. In fact, an overwhelming number don’t live that far from their hometown. That includes young people, one of the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/245789/record-numbers-americans-leave.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely demographic groups to say they want to move</a> and perhaps among the most flexible in being able to lay down new roots. A Center for Economic Studies <a href="https://www2.census.gov/ces/wp/2022/CES-WP-22-27.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research paper</a> released in July, for example, found that 80 percent of young Americans live within 100 miles of where they grew up, and 58 percent live within just 10 miles.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using de-identified administrative and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau as well as tax data, researchers limited their analysis to children born in the U.S. from 1978 to 1992 and found that at age 26, 69 percent lived in the commuting zone where they grew up, 58 percent lived within 10 miles, 80 percent lived within 100 miles, and 90 percent lived within 500 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that data implies that local moving patterns, especially around increasingly progressive cities situated in more conservative states, may be worth a closer look. The level of political diversity within states has become easy to spot on electoral maps — clusters of blue in major metropolitan areas like Atlanta, Nashville and Austin, for example, amidst redder spreads throughout the states of Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. Comparing these cities with their states may reveal more than comparing, say, all of California to all of Texas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This idea of ‘red state versus blue state’ misses a great deal of heterogeneity within states, as well as clusters and spatial patterns that occur within states,” said Ryan Strickler, a political scientist at Colorado State University, Pueblo. “Instead, we’re seeing more of a micro level of political sorting.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while there has been a lot of buzz about New Yorkers or San Franciscans flocking to smaller Southern cities, especially during the pandemic, that trend doesn’t represent the norm for most Americans, as a majority continue to stay tethered close to where they grew up. Even <a href="https://educationdata.org/college-enrollment-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most college students stay in-state</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, experts say the more significant phenomenon is people moving within the same state where they can find others who are politically like-minded. These migrations aren’t about specific political outcomes like the Dobbs decision. Instead, they’re linked to social polarization. “There’s a lot of local reshuffling,” said Alexander Bendeck, a Ph.D. student in the Georgia Institute of Technology’s School of Interactive Computing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In one of his current projects, Bendeck explores U.S. relocation patterns in the 2010s, using population migration data from the IRS to track the number of migrants between counties nationwide. Bendeck recognized the shift in migration from the coasts to the South or Midwest but also emphasized the effects of moving within metropolitan areas. Many natives of major Southern cities have moved out to the suburbs or to smaller cities. And the locals of those suburbs or cities move to more rural areas or even smaller cities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a huge caveat to any migration data: It is impossible to attribute all instances of relocation, even within the same state, to politics. In fact, politics has not been a major factor why most Americans have moved in recent history, Strickler said. Instead, migration is more financially driven, whether people are seeking out a lower cost of living, better job prospects or proximity to family. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that trend may be shifting. “People could be choosing places to move that are correlated with partisanship, even if it’s not explicitly all because of partisanship,” Strickler said. Assessing how abortion in particular affects geographic polarization will take years, and there will likely be compounding factors swaying Americans seeking a life somewhere more in line with their partisanship. Any effort to monitor this phenomenon, though, will need to venture beyond just red state versus blue state. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the last midterm elections, Democratic women won a historic number of congressional races. Two years later, the GOP had its own “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2020-could-be-the-new-year-of-the-woman-for-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year of the Woman</a>.” But now that the 2022 primaries are long over, we can say that any signs that Republican women would continue to gain on their Democratic counterparts were likely a flash in the pan, not a watershed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight, with an assist from political scientists Bernard Fraga and Hunter Rendleman, collected a trove of demographic and political information (such as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/progressives-democrats-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-candidates-race-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race and ethnicity</a> and gender) for every major-party candidate running in a Senate, House and governor’s race this cycle. Based on our analysis of this data, the share of women running for office this November is lower than it was in 2020 (with one type of office serving as a notable exception). Both parties have passed on opportunities to add more women to their ranks. But Democrats have provided more opportunities for female politicians than Republicans — thanks in part to divisions in the GOP’s infrastructure for electing women.</p>



<h2><strong>How many women are running and winning?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, women remain underrepresented in politics. Women are 51 percent of the voting-age population in the U.S., but only 27 percent of candidates who ran in primaries for Senate, House or governor this cycle were women.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest were men except Paperboy Love Prince, a Democratic candidate for New York’s 7th Congressional District, who is nonbinary. They did not win their primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> This is not because 3-in-10 candidates in each party are women: As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2020-could-be-the-new-year-of-the-woman-for-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been the norm</a> for a few decades, women made up a larger share of Democratic candidates than Republican candidates. There are many explanations for this persistent disparity. For instance, the potential candidate pool for Democrats is larger, as <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/womens-representation-and-the-gendered-pipeline-to-power/8865503038A92830047B4DB0481787A1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pipelines to political office</a> are occupied by more Democratic than Republican women, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/18/men-and-women-in-the-u-s-continue-to-differ-in-voter-turnout-rate-party-identification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more women identify as Democrats than Republicans</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This cycle, among candidates who advanced to the general election,<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alaska, California and Washington hold all-party primaries, meaning multiple candidates from the same party can make the November ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> women made up 43 percent of Democratic nominees and 20 percent of Republican nominees. This was a slight decline <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-women-than-ever-are-running-for-office-but-are-they-winning-their-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared to 2020</a>,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Aug. 25, 2020, when we conducted our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> when women were 47 percent of Democratic nominees and 22 percent of Republican nominees. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the share of female nominees declined compared to last cycle, women still overperformed in Democratic primaries this year, meaning they make up a larger share of Democratic nominees than they did of Democratic primary candidates. Meanwhile, the percentage of Republican women who won their primaries was essentially the same as the share of women in the overall Republican candidate pool.  </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This trend gets more complicated if you look beyond Congress, as women from both parties <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/2022-primaries-are-over-heres-what-you-need-know-about-women-nominees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke records</a> in gubernatorial races. Among Democrats, women were 30 percent of the gubernatorial candidate pool but 44 percent of nominees. Among Republicans, women constituted 20 percent of the candidate pool but 24 percent of nominees. This is remarkable because while women have increased their representation in Congress and state legislatures for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-women-are-holding-political-office-but-not-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last several election cycles</a>, governors’ mansions have been more of a challenge. There are still 19 states that have yet to have a female governor. But this year, three of those 19 states could elect their first female governor: Arkansas, Colorado and Georgia. (According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders is almost certain to win in Arkansas. But Republican Heidi Ganahl in Colorado and Democrat Stacey Abrams in Georgia are underdogs.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">In five other states — Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Michigan and Oregon — both majority-party nominees are women, guaranteeing a female governor (though not the first in any of these states). In Oregon, there is even a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive three-way race</a> between female candidates: Democrat Tina Kotek, Republican Christine Drazan and independent Betsy Johnson. Of the 36 governors races this cycle, a woman will be on the general election ballot in 20. </p>



<h2><strong>How racially diverse are women candidates?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">White men are still the largest share of candidates and nominees for both parties, and both parties ran and nominated far more white men than white women. But, interestingly, there is more gender parity among candidates of other races.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on candidate race and ethnicity was collected by political scientists Bernard Fraga and Hunter Rendleman. They relied on statements made by candidates, membership in racial and ethnic caucuses or organizations, racial and ethnic advocacy organizations, news articles and candidate websites. This research is, by nature, not comprehensive — for example, Fraga and Rendleman were unable to confirm some candidates’ racial identities — but the data is close enough to identify important trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> For example, according to Fraga and Rendleman’s data, Republicans nominated almost as many Latinas as Latinos. And Democrats nominated more Black women than Black men. That’s notable given how Black women are often considered the “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/21/politics/black-women-voters-michigan/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backbone</a>” of the Democratic Party.</p>

<h2><strong>How many women won primaries without incumbents?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Incumbents are disproportionately men. Incumbents also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost always win reelection</a>. So female candidates tend to have the best shot in open seats. But women in 2022 aren’t succeeding in incumbent-less primaries at nearly the same rate they did in 2020 or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-primaries-candidates-demographics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, women constituted 40 percent of the candidate pool in incumbent-less Democratic primaries and 57 percent of the party’s nominees. This year, women made up just 35 percent of the party’s candidates in incumbent-less primaries and 44 percent of its nominees. Those are practically the same numbers as the topline Democratic numbers in all primaries (including those in which incumbents ran). In other words, open seats were a boon to Democratic women in 2020; this year, not as much. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other side, if Republicans want to elect more women, they could either fix their pipeline problem or elect a higher share of the women candidates who run. But, according to our data, since 2020, they have made no progress on the former and have taken a step back on the latter. In 2020, women made up 24 percent of all candidates in GOP primaries without an incumbent and 32 percent of the winners. This year, though, women made up 23 percent of the candidates and just 23 percent of nominees.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The story is the same if you look at incumbent-less primaries that pitted at least one man against at least one woman. Women won 57 percent of such Democratic primaries — enough to get the party closer to gender parity, but still below 2020, when women won 73 percent of such head-to-head primaries. And while women won 50 percent of such Republican primaries in 2020, they won just 37 percent this year. </p>



<h2><strong>How important are endorsements from women’s groups?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another reason Democrats nominate more women than Republicans is that groups that recruit, train and support women are <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/abs/standing-on-their-shoulders-suffragists-womens-pacs-and-demands-for-womens-representation/256DE92B071304770292E1C5C362560D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more integrated into their party’s networks</a>. EMILY’s List, for instance, has deep pockets and has influenced primaries for decades by recruiting and financially supporting qualified and experienced women early in their primaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The GOP also has organizations that aim to elect more women. Still, they are <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/698848" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less integrated into their party’s donor networks</a> and have less influence. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/01/14/women-and-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican voters</a> have also made less of a push to prioritize electing women. In 2018, the now third-ranking Republican in the House, Rep. Elise Stefanik, started E-PAC to support a bench of female candidates, a move that <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Stefanik-rolls-out-PAC-committed-to-electing-more-13542939.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially received pushback</a> from the party. However, the party and E-PAC eventually made amends, and their candidates <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-women-than-ever-are-running-for-office-but-are-they-winning-their-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did well in 2020 primaries</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We looked at the candidates endorsed by EMILY’s List and four Republican women’s groups in the 2022 incumbent-less primaries and how often they won. Unsurprisingly, EMILY’s List had the best win rate of the five groups, exceeding its 2020 win rate of 84 percent. EMILY’s List also endorsed two candidates running against incumbents: Jessica Cisneros, who challenged Rep. Henry Cuellar in Texas, and Nellie Gorbea, who challenged Gov. Daniel McKee in Rhode Island. (Both women lost.) </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">We also looked at four Republican women’s groups: </p>



<ul><li>E-PAC is more aligned with former President Donald Trump’s wing of the party (it supported Trump’s endorsees more often than the other women’s groups).</li><li>Maggie’s List characterizes its ideology as fiscally conservative.</li><li>Winning for Women characterizes itself as “right of center.”</li><li>VIEW PAC’s mission is to elect “credible, serious, electable” women to federal office.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">Among the Republican groups, E-PAC had the strongest record in primaries without incumbents on the ballot: 79 percent of its endorsed candidates advanced to the general election (although this was not as good as E-PAC’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-women-than-ever-are-running-for-office-but-are-they-winning-their-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 win rate of 86 percent</a>). Winning for Women had a 67 percent win rate, down from 87 percent in 2020. Maggie’s List also had a 67 percent win rate, while VIEW PAC, which endorsed more candidates than the other Republican groups, had a 48 percent win rate.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn’t analyze the win rates of Maggie’s List or VIEW PAC in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, GOP women’s groups endorsed in a few critical races against each other. In New Hampshire’s 1st District, E-PAC supported Karoline Leavitt, but VIEW PAC supported Gail Huff Brown, and Leavitt won. In Alaska’s At-Large District, E-PAC supported Sarah Palin, while VIEW PAC supported Tara Sweeney. Both women advanced to the general election, though Sweeney <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/08/23/tara-sweeney-drops-out-of-alaska-us-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out shortly after</a>. In the Alaska Senate race, VIEW PAC backed incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski. At the same time, Maggie’s List supported Kelly Tshibaka (both advanced to the general election). Finally, in Florida’s 13th District, E-PAC supported Anna Paulina Luna, who defeated the VIEW PAC- and Maggie’s List-endorsed Amanda Makki.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This illustrates one of the many obstacles to Republicans electing more women: a lack of coordination among party elites. Of course, women are not a monolith. These endorsement disagreements may reflect existing (and growing) ideological fissures within the GOP, such as embracing Trumpism. However, the ideological winds could have been working against Republican women in other ways. According to political science research, Republican women who run for office are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/0022-3816.00019?casa_token=_5SuMi1bdxsAAAAA:rer1hAN9R5G1EgsC8F2MI7vYOjRmbAEPXY1asoPxpAysgMB-i-k7s6jG6V5cmVjROTRlqFdvs5oLQw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived as more moderate than Republican men</a>, even when they aren’t. And the perception that women are more moderate may have hurt women in Republican primaries in deep-red states, especially when they face off against a candidate with Trump’s endorsement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The GOP’s struggle to elect more women clearly has more than one root cause. But both parties still have a long way to go before they reach gender parity.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Oct. 12, 2022, 6:10 p.m.):</strong> The data originally used in this article did not include Taysha DeVaughan, the Democratic nominee for Virginia’s 9th Congressional District. The share of Democratic nominees in incumbent-less primaries who are women and the tables listing the total number of female nominees by party and each party’s share of candidates by gender and race have been corrected to reflect her addition.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On the surface, Nevada seems to validate the <a href="https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/hans-georg-betz-donald-trump-populism-republican-party-emerging-democratic-majority-us-politics-news-18211/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">otherwise somewhat unsuccessful</a> hypothesis of the 2002 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Democratic-Majority-John-Judis/dp/0743254783" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a> “The Emerging Democratic Majority.” Authors John Judis and Ruy Teixeira <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/upshot/democratic-majority-book.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> that Nevada would become a light-blue state as Democrats held onto their unionized, working-class base and demographic change brought new Democratic voters into the fold.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although Democratic nominee John Kerry narrowly lost to George W. Bush in Nevada in the following presidential election, Barack Obama carried the state by a whopping 12.5 percentage points in 2008, and Democrats have won the state in every presidential election since. Nevada’s senators, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, are both Democrats, as is its governor, Steve Sisolak, and three of its four U.S. representatives.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, Nevada is usually a pretty reliable state for Democrats, right? Well, not so fast. Cortez Masto, up for reelection this year, is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly trailing in the polling average</a> against her Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 a.m. Eastern on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> Our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast</a> has this race at about as close to 50/50 odds as it gets. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And just to be clear about the stakes here, Nevada couldn’t be much more important in determining which party controls the Senate. It is Republicans’ most likely pickup opportunity, according to FiveThirtyEight’s forecast<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 a.m. Eastern on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> — and the GOP’s second-best target, Georgia, took a big hit this week after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new allegations</a> surfaced that Republican nominee Herschel Walker paid for his then-girlfriend to get an abortion in 2009.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voting-rights-north-carolina-hinge-supreme-court-election-91401195</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The math is fairly simple. If Democrats pick up a seat in Pennsylvania, where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored</a> to win, Republicans will need two pickups to gain control of the Senate, and Nevada and Georgia are the easiest targets. If Fetterman loses, they’ll need one of the two. According to our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive</a>,<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 a.m. Eastern on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> Republicans’ chances of flipping the Senate shoot up to 56 percent if they win Nevada but are just 11 percent if they don’t. So let’s take a deeper look.</p>



<h2><strong>Nevada isn’t that blue</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Several things stand out. First, although Democrats have a four-election winning streak in presidential races, their record in congressional and gubernatorial elections is checkered. Sisolak was the first Democrat elected governor there since 1994. And even though Cortez Masto’s <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_III.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class III</a> Senate seat was in Democratic hands for some time thanks to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Rosen’s <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_I.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class I</a> seat was held by Republicans between 2001 and 2019. House races in Nevada have been swingy, meanwhile. As recently as 2014, Republicans won the state’s combined popular vote for the U.S. House by 17.4 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And with the exceptions of Obama and Reid — and we’ll come back to what they had in common in a moment — Democratic wins in Nevada have been narrow. Hillary Clinton’s 2.4-point win in 2016 was similar to her national margin of victory in the popular vote — and Joe Biden’s 2.4-point win in 2020 was less than his 4.5-point national popular-vote win. Sisolak and Rosen, meanwhile, won their gubernatorial and Senate races by 4 and 5 points, respectively, in 2018, but both of them underperformed the national political environment that year, which <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored Democrats by almost 9 points</a>. Whether you call Nevada blue, red or purple is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-state-like-michigan-might-actually-be-a-blue-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">something of a semantic question</a>. But it certainly hasn’t been a <em>reliable</em> state for Democrats.</p>



<h2><strong>Nevada isn’t a great fit for the new Democratic coalition</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Paired together as tipping-point states this year, Nevada and Georgia are moving in opposite directions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Georgia has a sizable share of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/12/15/black-eligible-voters-have-accounted-for-nearly-half-of-georgia-electorates-growth-since-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black voters</a> and a multiethnic coalition of <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/community-development/publications/partners-update/2015/01/workforce-development/150210-trends-in-educational-attainment-in-atlanta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly</a> <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/in-battleground-georgia-new-voters-on-the-rise-before-22-election/W2VMBFGVXJCNVM3MIIKTMN4OYI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college-educated</a> voters in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/georgia-senate-political-geography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlanta and its suburbs</a>. The Black vote there has held up relatively well for Democrats, and they’ve been gaining ground with college-educated professionals in almost every election. If you tried to create a state in a lab where Democratic fortunes improved even as they had problems elsewhere, Georgia would be about as good a formula as you could get.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevada, on the other hand, ranks <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=S1501&amp;g=0100000US%240400000&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2021.S1501&amp;moe=false&amp;tp=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">44th in the share of adults with a college degree</a>, right between Oklahoma and Alabama. Its Black population is below the national average <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2021/08/16/census-data-shows-communities-of-color-are-the-new-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but increasing</a>. It does have a considerable share of <a href="https://naleo.org/COMMS/PRA/2022/Nevada-2022-Profile.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hispanic</a> and <a href="https://apiavote.org/wp-content/uploads/Nevada.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asian American</a> voters, but they are often working-class — subgroups that Democrats have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-appeals-to-the-working-class-are-unlikely-to-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly struggled with in recent years</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Nevada is sui generis, with several economic and demographic attributes that aren’t that common in other states. On the one hand, it has a massive workforce in the <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/gaming/Knowledge-Base/Articles/Gambling-vs-Gaming?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming</a> (gambling), leisure and hospitality industries. To give you some sense of the scale, just one hospitality and entertainment company, MGM Resorts International, employs <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/largest-companies-in-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">77,000 people in Nevada</a>, roughly as large a share of its workforce as <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/largest-companies-in-michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ford Motor Company employs in Michigan</a>. These are mostly working-class and middle-class jobs, <a href="https://unitehere.org/industry/gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often unionized</a>, often held by employees of color. But Nevada doesn’t have as many jobs in culturally progressive industries like media and technology.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, Nevada is a major destination for out-migrants from other states who are attracted to its warm weather,<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a frequent visitor to Nevada, I’ve started to buy the it’s-a-dry-heat thing! Summer is more tolerable than you’d think, and the rest of the year can be downright beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> lack of state income tax and laissez-faire lifestyle. Only 26 percent of Nevada residents were born in Nevada, <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-nevada/nevadas-speed-of-growth-puts-silver-state-natives-in-vast-minority-1581962/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easily the lowest of any U.S. state</a>. Nevada has traditionally had a big third-party vote — it was <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/data.php?year=1992&amp;datatype=national&amp;def=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Ross Perot’s better states</a>, for instance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This latter group of voters can also be relatively apolitical. If people migrate to Colorado for its crunchy, progressive politics, and to Florida for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Man" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YOLO</a> conservatism, the prevailing attitude in Nevada is live-and-let-live, which sometimes borders on political apathy. Political participation is relatively low. Its turnout rate in 2020 was <a href="https://www.electproject.org/2020g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65.4 percent</a>, lower than the 66.8 percent in the U.S. overall — which is unusual because swing states usually have high turnout. By comparison, for instance, turnout was 71.7 percent in Florida in 2020 and 76.4 percent in Colorado.</p>



<h2><strong>Turnout could be Democrats’ saving grace</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s return to that question I teased earlier. What did Obama and Reid, the two big Democratic overperformers in Nevada, have in common? For that matter, what about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who never got to compete in a general election in Nevada but performed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/bernie-sanders-nevada-caucus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely well</a> in the state’s Democratic caucuses in 2020?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Well, Reid, Obama and Sanders relied heavily on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/nevada-democrats-lean-harry-reids-political-machine-warning-lights-fla-rcna25040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organization, turnout and the state’s union-backed Democratic machine</a>. It’s hard to know whether Cortez Masto — and Sisolak, who is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also in a very tight reelection race</a> — will be able to pull off the same. But if you have two large voting blocs in Nevada, and the more conservative of the two is somewhat politically apathetic, turnout at least potentially works to Democrats’ advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, this may be a race where Democrats need the turnout edge because the other dynamics of the campaign don’t work in their favor. Though he’s an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election denier</a> who served as one of then-President Donald Trump’s Nevada campaign chairs in 2020, Laxalt has a relatively traditional resume as the state’s former attorney general — an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-hard-to-win-a-senate-race-when-youve-never-won-an-election-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exception among Republicans</a> in competitive Senate races this year — and in recent polling, he has <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FMgbnIJWR3zoCnMfSk9ft4EcHQOuJ_Q5/edit#gid=644494231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decent personal favorability ratings</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although abortion is a strong issue for Cortez Masto in a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively irreligious state</a> like Nevada, voters in the Silver State <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FMgbnIJWR3zoCnMfSk9ft4EcHQOuJ_Q5/edit#gid=644494231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rank the economy as their top issue</a>. It’s understandable in a state that was <a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/history-a-look-at-the-housing-bubble-burst-and-long-term-impact-on-las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit hard by the housing bubble</a> and that relies on highly cyclical industries like the casino business, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/las-vegas-strip-closed-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the turnout front, a CNN/SSRS poll <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/politics/cnn-poll-arizona-nevada-senate-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a> had both good and bad news for Cortez Masto, depending on how you squint at it. In the survey, she led by 3 points among registered voters but trailed by 2 points among likely voters. Polls among likely voters are usually more reliable, and so the +2 number for Laxalt is the one in our polling average and forecast. But it does suggest a gap that could be closed by a strong turnout operation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Reid, for instance, won comfortably in 2010 despite <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/senate/nv/nevada_senate_angle_vs_reid-1517.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailing in the polling average</a>. Cortez Masto may need a little bit of Reid magic to hold onto her seat.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Last month, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/19/1123767437/joe-biden-covid-19-pandemic-over" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden said</a> what many Americans have long been thinking: “The pandemic is over.” With vaccinations, broader immunity and better treatments, the death toll from this virus is <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/09/01/a-third-covid-autumn-is-upon-us-heres-a-look-at-where-we-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nowhere near what it was</a> at the peak of the pandemic, and many Americans are returning to their pre-pandemic ways of life. As we head into the cold, flu and, most likely, COVID-19 season, as well as into an election that is about basically everything but COVID-19, we wondered: When did Americans stop caring about the coronavirus?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when public concern around the pandemic shifted for good, as there have been several inflection points. One way of seeing this is by looking at monthly surveys, like one <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Axios/Ipsos that started in March 2020</a>, to illustrate the crest and fall of Americans’ concerns around the pandemic. In the first three weeks of April 2020 — the thick of lockdown — just 19 percent of Americans said they had visited friends or relatives in the past week. That number has steadily risen over the two and a half years since, dipping occasionally when a new wave emerged. For example, an average of 62 percent of Americans said they visited friends or family during the summer of 2021, but that average dropped to 54 percent during the winter 2021 — the omicron-variant wave. And in the chart below, you can also see how the share of Americans who say they’re self-quarantining and wearing masks has declined, while the share who say they’ve returned to their pre-pandemic lives has increased:</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Americans have gotten less concerned about COVID-19" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Iyp5H/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">One switch happened in June 2022, when the share of Americans who said they’d returned to their pre-pandemic lives rose higher than the percentage who said they still wore a mask outside the home at least sometimes. National survey data from the Annenberg Public Policy Center <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/despite-awareness-of-covid-19-risks-many-americans-say-theyre-back-to-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plots a similar course</a>. In September 2021, 52 percent of Americans said they often or always wore a mask indoors when in contact with people outside their household, while just 11 percent said they never did. Those numbers plunged this year, with 27 percent of Americans in July 2022 saying they now never wore a mask, while just 11 percent said they always did. Likewise, in January 2022, 16 percent of Americans said their lives had already returned to their pre-pandemic normal, while 35 percent expected they were still more than a year away from that return. By July, 41 percent of Americans said their lives had returned to normal, and 19 percent said that normal was still a year away. Google trends also show that search interest in COVID-19 <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-03-01%202022-10-05&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fg%2F11j2cc_qll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is at a pandemic low</a>.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of data from Sept. 25 to Oct. 1, the latest set of complete data as of the time of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We can also chart this shift in attention by looking at not just the poll responses but also the poll questions. In March 2021, half of all national polls tracked by FiveThirtyEight featured at least one COVID-19-related question. That share has slowly ticked down as other issues, such as inflation, have become more prevalent. Last month, just 14 percent of polls had at least one COVID-19 question, while 22 percent asked about inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Pollsters have been asking fewer questions about COVID-19" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/U2G5L/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Starting in April 2021, you can see pollsters gradually asking more questions about other topics, while asking about COVID-19 less frequently. And largely, this tracks with Americans' views of what issues are most important to them. In April 2020, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391220/inflation-dominates-americans-economic-concerns-march.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent of Americans named the COVID-19</a> pandemic as their top concern, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Gallup</a>. And in January this year, 20 percent of Americans said the pandemic was the biggest concern, while just 8 percent said the high cost of living or inflation. By March, a higher share of Americans named inflation (17 percent) as a top concern than the share who named the pandemic (3 percent). And inflation has remained steady, with around 17 percent of Americans saying it's their top concern since this past March and an average of 37 percent of Americans listing some kind of economic issue as their top concern in the same timeframe.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The ebbing concern around COVID-19 is also reflected in the apathy around receiving booster shots. Gone are the days of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/these-vaccine-hunters-are-chasing-down-appointments-for-people-who-need-them-most" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategically logging into your local pharmacy’s</a> website at midnight to secure a vaccine appointment, or <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/29/texas-coronavirus-vaccine-rural/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving hundreds of miles</a> just to get a jab. While nearly 80 percent of Americans <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have received at least one dose</a> of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 68 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, just under 49 percent of Americans had received their first booster shot, as of Sept. 28. And <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-september-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a September poll</a> from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 51 percent of U.S. adults had heard “a little” or “nothing” about the new COVID-19 booster shot that is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-bivalent-vaccine-boosters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formulated to protect against</a> the omicron variant. In that same survey, only 5 percent said they had gotten the updated booster, while 27 percent said they plan to get it “as soon as possible.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet, as much as we all have been eager to get back to normal — and despite Biden’s proclamation — <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/hundreds-americans-dying-covid-19-day-ahead-fall/story?id=89764674" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of Americans continue to die</a> of COVID-19 every day, and many immunocompromised Americans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/us/high-risk-covid-immunocompromised.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report feeling abandoned</a> by others’ more relaxed approach to the virus these days. So it’s clear that while most Americans think the pandemic is over, many don’t yet have the luxury of that thinking.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The Supreme Court continues to suffer in the eyes of public opinion, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_093022/">according to a Monmouth University poll</a> conducted Sept. 21-25. More Americans disapproved of the job the court is doing (54 percent) than those who approved (37 percent), a trend that has held steady since May. Meanwhile, two-thirds of Americans were on board with implementing term limits for the justices, a position that enjoys relative bipartisan approval: Eighty-six percent of Democrats, 63 percent of independents and 51 percent of Republicans supported such a measure. However, the response to the idea of court expansion remains highly partisan, with 67 percent of Democrats saying they’d like to see more seats added, compared with only 30 percent of independents and 14 percent of Republicans. </li><li>Politics appear to be a lose-lose situation. A recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/10/03/growing-share-of-americans-say-their-side-in-politics-has-been-losing-more-often-than-winning/">survey from the Pew Research Center</a> found that a majority of Americans on both sides of the aisle felt that their party is losing more than winning on issues important to them, including 81 percent of Republicans and 66 percent of Democrats. That hasn’t always been the case in recent years. A majority of Republicans in 2019 (54 percent) and 2020 (69 percent) — i.e., when Donald Trump was still in office — felt their party was winning on issues more often than not. But that optimistic outlook hasn’t replicated for Democrats under Biden: Only 34 percent of conservative/moderate Democrats and 29 percent of liberal Democrats thought their party was seeing success on major issues important to them. </li><li>Just under half of Americans (45 percent) believed that young people today will experience a better standard of living than their parents, per a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-race-and-ethnicity-427d11fda282ff12e155afbdbebd35a7">UChicago Harris/AP-NORC poll</a> conducted Aug. 25-29. Young people themselves, or adults ages 18 to 44, were even less optimistic, at 39 percent. However, the breakdown looks a bit different by race. While only 41 percent of white Americans and 44 percent of Hispanic Americans had a positive outlook for the next generation, a slightly greater share of Black Americans (54 percent) held out hope for young Americans. </li><li>Americans are split on whether artificial-intelligence advancements in producing hyperrealistic art are a good thing for society, according to an Oct. 5 <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2022/10/05/58f11/1">YouGov poll</a>. And while 31 percent view such technology positively and 27 percent do so negatively, a plurality (42 percent) just wasn’t sure. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2022/10/05/58f11/2">Additional data from YouGov</a> found that a minority of Americans (36 percent) said they’ve ever seen a realistic, AI-generated image of a person, while <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2022/10/05/58f11/3">a vast majority</a> hadn’t used AI-driven image-generating websites themselves: Seventy-three percent of Americans had never done so, including 58 percent ages 18 to 29 and 57 percent between ages 30 and 44. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, The Daily Beast reported that Herschel Walker, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Georgia who has campaigned on being anti-abortion, paid for his then-girlfriend’s abortion in 2009. Walker has denied the allegation. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses how the scandals surrounding Walker have evolved over the course of his Senate campaign and how this could affect the outcome of the race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They break down how candidate misconduct is generally factored into the FiveThirtyEight model and if this newest allegation will even be considered a scandal by the model’s standards.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/">Geoffrey Skelley</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/ryan-best/">Ryan Best</a></p>
<p>One of the “rules” of American politics is that the party that doesn’t control the White House <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/">will pick up seats</a> in the U.S. House of Representatives during the midterm election. Considering that Democrats hold the White House and only a slim 222-to-213-seat edge in the House,<a tabindex="0" data-number="1" aria-label="Footnote 1. Select to expand footnote.">1</a> Republicans appear to have a straightforward path to retaking Congress’s lower chamber. Indeed, FiveThirtyEight’s midterm forecast gives Republicans <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/">about a 7-in-10 shot</a> of claiming a majority, as of Oct. 4, 2022, at 10:18 AM.</p>
<p>But knowing exactly which districts Republicans might swing is harder to say with certainty. The GOP’s path to a majority mostly runs through districts represented by Democrats but whose historic voting patterns suggest they are highly competitive or lean at least a bit to the right. Republicans also hope to pick up a handful of bluer seats, as the party not in the White House sometimes captures “reach” seats in midterms. But a 7-in-10 chance is nowhere near a guarantee for Republicans: Democrats’ hopes of retaining the House rest on swinging a handful of GOP-held seats and holding onto the same competitive seats the Republicans are targeting.</p>
<p>The map below shows the House seats that are most vulnerable to swinging from one party to the other based on our forecast.</p>

<p>With the help of data from midterm elections between 1998 and 2018, we’ve identified the types of districts that have historically swung between parties and grouped them into four clusters based on the incumbent party and the district’s partisan lean.<a tabindex="0" data-number="2" aria-label="Footnote 2. Select to expand footnote.">2</a> Three groups consist of districts that Republicans could flip: conservative-leaning districts currently held by a Democrat, competitive “purply” districts currently held by a Democrat, and liberal-leaning districts held by a Democrat. The fourth and final group consists of all districts currently held by Republicans that Democrats could flip. Now, due to redistricting, there’s also an additional fifth group because 20 districts either don’t have an incumbent party or have two incumbents running. We don’t map out those seats, but we do briefly discuss them at the end.<a tabindex="0" data-number="3" aria-label="Footnote 3. Select to expand footnote.">3</a> But as for the other 415 seats, we can examine how much they matter to each party’s majority-making hopes in the maps below.</p>
<p>First up, we have 11 seats that should offer the easiest pickup opportunities for the Republicans: districts currently represented by a Democrat but vote at least 5 points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric. In the six midterm elections held between 1998 to 2018, the party in the GOP’s position – that is, the party not in the White House – has managed to swing almost 3-in-5 seats that leaned toward it but were held by the president’s party. The most notable result was in 2010, when Republicans gained 63 seats overall, around two-thirds of which were red-leaning districts held by Democrats. The good news for Democrats in 2022 is that, compared with 2010, they don’t have nearly as much red turf to defend. But Republicans only need to flip five net seats to capture the House, and they could win at least that many from this category alone.</p>

<p>Unlike 2010, this midterm will take place under new district lines, and many of the seats Republicans have the best chance of swinging have changed significantly due to redistricting. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/">Florida’s GOP-drawn map</a> transformed <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/florida/7/">the 7th</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/florida/13/">13th districts</a> from highly competitive to clearly Republican-leaning, while Tennessee Republicans <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/">transformed</a> the Nashville-based 5th District into a red bastion. These changes weren’t all due to partisan mapmaking, though. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/">Arizona’s new map</a>, drawn by the state’s independent redistricting commission, improved Republicans’ chances in both the 2nd and 6th districts, turning former swing seats into red-leaning districts. Democratic Rep. Tom O’Halleran is mounting a defense in Arizona’s 2nd, which has helped Democrats’ chances there as incumbents still get at least <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/681670">a small boost</a>. No Democratic incumbents are defending the five most swingy seats, which only helps the GOP’s odds.</p>
<p>Some other red-leaning districts controlled by Democrats didn’t change much in redistricting, but they are also in the GOP’s sights as longer-term trends continue to reshape their political preferences. Wisconsin’s 3rd District has been <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/wisconsin-decisive-again-in-2020/">drifting to the right in the past decade</a>, and longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired, making it a prime Republican target. Democratic incumbents are seeking reelection in Maine’s 2nd District and Pennsylvania’s 8th District, but <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2020/11/16/politics/maines-polarized-political-shift-may-survive-the-trump-era/">northern Maine</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/pennsylvania-political-geography/">northeast Pennsylvania</a> have swung right in the Trump era.</p>
<p>But no other seats look more like toss-ups than the 24 Democratic-held districts that have a partisan lean between D+5 and R+5. After all, during midterms from 1998 to 2018, the party in the GOP’s position flipped nearly one-third of seats like this held by the president’s party. Of these two dozen races, 13 involve Democrats defending seats they first won during the 2018 blue wave, but this year, Republicans may end some of their tenures in Congress.</p>

<p>At the top of that endangered list is Rep. Tom Malinowski in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-jersey/7/">New Jersey’s 7th District</a>. In redistricting, New Jersey’s bipartisan commission <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/02/03/n-j-congressional-map-stands-after-top-court-dismisses-gop-challenge/">picked the Democratic-drawn map</a>, which worked to protect all potentially vulnerable Democrats save Malinowski, whose light blue seat became light red.<a tabindex="0" data-number="4" aria-label="Footnote 4. Select to expand footnote.">4</a> In addition to Malinowski, three other Democrats first elected in 2018 are caught in toss-up races of their own for seats that now lean a hair to the right after redistricting: Democratic Reps. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/iowa/3/">Cindy Axne of Iowa</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/kansas/3/">Sharice Davids of Kansas</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/7/">Susan Wild of Pennsylvania</a>.</p>
<p>Republicans also have a chance of swinging some open seats in this cluster. Perhaps most notably, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/oregon/5/">Oregon’s 5th District</a> could prove to be a self-defeating moment for Democratic primary voters: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/27/centrist-schrader-ousted-in-oregon-primary-00035728">They ousted longtime centrist Rep. Kurt Schrader</a> and backed progressive Jamie McLeod-Skinner in this D+3 seat, which <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/05/oregons-5th-district-race-takes-new-turn-with-kurt-schrader-out-in-historic-loss.html">has potentially boosted</a> the chances of Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer. Over in Illinois, Democrats in the state legislature <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/">drew the state’s 17th District</a> to be somewhat bluer in redistricting, but western Illinois <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/notes-on-the-state-of-politics-may-3-2021/">has been trending to the right</a>, and Republican Esther Joy King could find victory after narrowly losing in 2020 to now-retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos. Additionally, Democratic Reps. Conor Lamb and Tom Suozzi left behind <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/17/">Pennsylvania’s 17th District</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/">New York’s 3rd District</a> to pursue failed statewide bids, respectively, which will potentially aid Republicans’ chances of capturing those seats.</p>
<p>The remaining seats involve incumbents who are currently favored but far from shoo-ins, especially if the political environment becomes more favorable to Republicans in the final month of the campaign, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/">we may see some nascent signs of</a> based on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/upshot/republicans-midterm-elections.html">recent polling and economic news</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we turn to the 178 seats Democrats are defending that vote at least 5 points more Democratic than the country as a whole. Most of these districts will not be in play in 2022, especially considering the president’s party won 96 percent of districts like this between 1998 and 2018. Still, a shift to the right in the political environment could open the door for the GOP in some of the blue-but-not-deep-blue seats in this category. For instance, in both 2006 and 2018, Democrats managed to flip 18 seats that were R+5 or redder while a Republican president was in office.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, our forecast is currently bearish on the GOP’s odds of swinging some of these districts. If the GOP is going to capture some of these “reach” seats, their best shot may come in a seat like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/nevada/4/">Nevada’s 4th District</a>, a D+5 seat defended by Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford, whom Republican Sam Peters could best with an assist from the political environment and perhaps lingering negativity toward Horsford over revelations of a past extramarital affair <a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/05/21/horsfords-extramarital-affair-with-former-senate-staffer-shows-how-narrow-house-rules-are/">that came to light in 2020</a>. Republicans <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/15/kevin-mccarthy-allan-fung-republicans">have also made a play</a> for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/rhode-island/2/">Rhode Island’s 2nd District</a> a D+16 seat left open by retiring Democratic Rep. Jim Langevin. Republican Allan Fung is well-funded and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2014&amp;fips=44&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0">nearly won</a> the Ocean State’s governorship in 2014, but he faces an uphill battle against Democrat Seth Magaziner, the state’s General Treasurer.</p>
<p>The last cluster of districts are the 202 seats Republicans are defending, which history suggests won’t be easy for Democrats to swing in their direction: In the six midterms from 1998 to 2018, the White House party flipped just 2 percent of the districts defended by their opponent, regardless of their partisan lean. However, the political environment following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/">has proven to be less advantageous</a> for the GOP than we might’ve otherwise expected, given historical midterm patters. This, in combination with redistricting and the candidates chosen by some Republican primary voters, has opened the door for Democrats to make a play for a handful of seats Republicans are defending this November.</p>

<p>Most notably, Democrats have a decent chance of flipping <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/3/">Michigan’s 3rd District</a>, where Democrat Hillary Scholten is slightly favored over Republican John Gibbs. Before August, Republican Rep. Peter Meijer <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/3/">was a good bet</a> to hold onto the seat, which became slightly Democratic-leaning <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/">under the new lines</a> drawn by Michigan’s independent redistricting commission. But <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/michigan-rep-rashida-tlaib-wins-democratic-primary-race-87854767">Meijer lost to Gibbs</a> in the Aug. 2 GOP primary, as Gibbs <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-3-pro-impeachment-house-republicans-survive-tuesdays-primaries/">gained former President Donald Trump’s endorsement</a> after Meijer <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/">voted to impeach him in 2021</a>. Similarly, Democrats may be able to make a play for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/22/">New York’s 22nd District</a>. Moderate Republican Rep. John Katko <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-but-one-house-republican-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-faces-a-trump-endorsed-challenger/">retired after voting to impeach Trump</a>, and <a href="https://auburnpub.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/williams-upsets-wells-for-gop-nod-conole-wins-democratic-primary-for-congress/article_dfef723d-1357-5b60-9a6a-1e29decbcf64.html">Republican primary voters in the Syracuse-area seat opted for</a> the Trumpier and less well-funded Brandon Williams instead of the national GOP’s preferred candidate in what our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/22/">forecast views as a toss-up race</a>.</p>
<p>Redistricting also played a role in the competitiveness of three Republican-held toss-up seats Democrats hope to flip. In California, the state’s independent redistricting commission placed Republican Reps. David Valadao and Mike Garcia <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/">in seats that were somewhat bluer</a> than the ones they currently hold, while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/">New Mexico Democrats drew</a> GOP Rep. Yvette Herrell’s district to be highly competitive so that they might unseat her.</p>
<p>We’ve covered 415 of the House’s 435 seats here, but the remaining 20 districts don’t have an incumbent party, 18 because they are newly drawn or because an incumbent who might’ve run there decided to run in a nearby seat instead, and two others because they feature a general election showdown between a Democratic and Republican incumbent. Overall, 11 of these districts favor the GOP to some extent, seven favor Democrats and two are essentially toss-ups. So this, too, is a marginally beneficial category for Republicans, although it’s harder to say how these compare in a modern midterm context because the only other midterm since 1998 to come after decennial redistricting was in 2002, a sample size of one.</p>
<p>The four main categories of seats show where we might expect districts to swing this November. Republicans will be best positioned to challenge for the House majority thanks to the competitive seats and Republican-leaning seats held by Democrats. Democrats in turn will hope to flip a few GOP-controlled districts at the margins, prevent Republicans from grabbing hold of more Democratic-leaning seats and retain as many of those highly competitive districts as they can. History is on the GOP’s side, but the 2022 story still has to be written.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">No state voting for governor this year has seen a longer Republican drought than Oregon. In 1982, Republican Gov. Vic Atiyeh <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1982&amp;fips=41&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handily won reelection</a>, but since then Democrats have come out on top in 10 consecutive gubernatorial elections, allowing them to govern Oregon for nearly four decades.<a data-footnote-id="30" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-30" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans haven’t won a governor’s race in Washington since 1980, but that state regularly votes for governor in presidential cycles. Meanwhile, Democrats’ longest drought comes in South Dakota, where they last won in 1974 and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/south-dakota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;look likely to lose again&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>30</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But 2022 might be the year Republicans finally break their Beaver State losing streak. Republican Christine Drazan, the former minority leader of the Oregon House of Representatives, is running neck and neck with Democrat Tina Kotek, the former longtime speaker of the state House who could become the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/meet-oregons-tina-kotek-hopes-americas-first-lesbian-governor-rcna30628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first out lesbian governor</a> in the U.S. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast</a> views the race as a toss-up, giving Kotek and Drazan each about a 1-in-2 shot of victory.<a data-footnote-id="31" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-31" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a> And Drazan holds a narrow 34 percent to 33 percent advantage over Kotek in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a>, with independent Betsy Johnson, a former state legislator who served for nearly two decades as a Democrat, attracting about 20 percent.<a data-footnote-id="32" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>32</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason Drazan has a chance is that, while Oregon leans Democratic, it’s far from being a deep-blue state. For instance, George W. Bush nearly won the state <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2000&amp;fips=41&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 2000 presidential race</a>, and in 2016, Oregon elected Republican Dennis Richardson as secretary of state, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/02/oregon-secretary-of-state-dennis-richardson-dies-of-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making him the first GOP candidate</a> to win a statewide race <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2002&amp;fips=41&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2002</a>. In fact, while Oregon has consistently elected Democrats to the governorship since the 1980s, the Democratic margin of victory has only once exceeded 10 percentage points, with Republicans coming closest to winning in 2010, when they lost by just 1.5 points.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even very favorable Republican midterm years like 2010 haven’t been good enough for the GOP to capture the <a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2015/02/23/neighbors-pleased-mahonia-hall-occupied/23918143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s mansion in Salem</a>, so what explains Drazan’s heightened chance of success? At least three factors seem to be playing a part: Johnson’s role as a major independent candidate, Kotek’s poor public perception and Democratic Gov. Kate Brown’s unpopularity — all of which may have many Oregonians looking for change.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Few statewide races involve a truly competitive third wheel, but Johnson could significantly impact this election. Not only is she polling well, she’s also outraised Drazan and Kotek: Johnson had brought in $13.2 million in total contributions, more than Kotek’s $12.7 million and Drazan’s $10.7 million.<a data-footnote-id="33" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-33" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>33</sup></a> And <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-09-13/2022-oregon-competitive-governor-race-in-democratic-stronghold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson has positioned</a> herself <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/09/unaffiliated-governor-candidate-betsy-johnson-would-bring-decades-long-skepticism-about-government-to-the-job.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between her opponents</a>, dinging Drazan for her <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/elections/drazan-pro-life-woman-aware-of-oregon-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-abortion stance</a> and Kotek for allegedly intending to make Oregon “woke and broke.” Johnson has received high-profile, <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/05/19/former-gov-ted-kulongoski-and-former-us-sen-gordon-smith-both-endorse-betsy-johnson-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan endorsements</a> from former Democratic Gov. Ted Kulongoski and former Republican Sen. Gordon Smith, and <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/10/nike-co-founder-phil-knight-donated-another-2-million-to-betsy-johnson-in-september.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major financial support</a> from uber-wealthy Nike co-founder Phil Knight and timber industry executives (Johnson herself comes from a <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/08/17/two-candidates-for-governor-turn-over-their-tax-returns-betsy-johnson-declines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealthy family with timber interests</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But for all the attention and money it has garnered, Johnson’s candidacy is less a question about winning — she has less than a 1-in-100 shot of winning the governorship, and FiveThirtyEight only recently made her a viable candidate in our forecast — and more a question of whether she boosts either candidate’s chances by siphoning off more Democrats or Republicans. Emerson College <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/oregon-2022-republican-christine-drazan-with-two-point-lead-over-democrat-tina-kotek-for-governorship-sen-wyden-holds-19-point-lead-in-re-election-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a poll on Tuesday</a> that found Drazan a smidge ahead of Kotek, with both in the mid-30s, and Johnson trailing at 19 percent. But Johnson earned more support among Democrats (17 percent) than Republicans (9 percent). Additionally, the poll found Kotek winning only 59 percent of self-identified Biden voters, with Johnson carrying 27 percent of them, while Drazan was winning 79 percent of Trump voters and Johnson just 9 percent. Similarly, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/09/christine-drazan-tina-kotek-neck-and-neck-in-race-for-governor-new-poll-shows.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a late September poll</a> by DHM Research on behalf of The Oregonian/OregonLive also put Drazan and Kotek both in the low 30s, with Johnson at 18 percent, and that poll also found more Democrats (19 percent) than Republicans (13 percent) planned to vote for Johnson.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is not to say Drazan’s path to victory is all down to Johnson complicating Kotek’s efforts to consolidate the Democratic base, as the public sees Kotek more negatively than it sees Drazan. The Emerson poll found, for example, that only 38 percent of likely voters viewed Kotek favorably, while 50 percent viewed her unfavorably, including a rough 55 percent unfavorable rating among independents. By comparison, Drazan ran about even among all likely voters, at 42 percent favorable and 41 percent favorable. (Johnson had overall numbers similar to Kotek.) This may be down to Kotek’s profile as a <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/state/2022/03/30/tina-kotek-is-accomplishedand-struggles-to-gain-traction-with-some-democrats-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong progressive on social issues</a>, which may make it easier for her opponents to paint her as too left-wing for even a blue-leaning state like Oregon. At the same time, she has a reputation as a wheeler-dealer, which has at times angered members of her party; this could help explain why almost 1 in 5 Democrats also held an unfavorable view of Kotek in the Emerson poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having served as speaker from 2013 to early 2022, Kotek <a href="https://ktvz.com/news/election/2022/09/27/decision-2022-drazan-johnson-and-kotek-spar-over-wide-number-of-issues-at-bend-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also linked</a> to outgoing Democratic Gov. Kate Brown, who held the state’s top job for most of the same period, after becoming governor following Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/02/kate-brown-americas-first-openly-bisexual-governor-oregon-John-Kitzhaber/385496/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 resignation</a>. But Brown is leaving office unpopular <a href="https://www.pdxmonthly.com/news-and-city-life/2022/09/kate-brown-governor-leaving-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amid complaints about</a> lengthy school closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns about conditions in Portland, which has suffered from vandalism, public disorder and a lack of affordable housing. In the second quarter of 2022, 55 percent of Oregon’s registered voters disapproved of Brown and only 40 percent approved, according to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/07/19/democratic-governors-are-resisting-bidens-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult’s polling</a>, so the incumbent may serve as an anchor weighing down Kotek and encouraging voters — even Democrats and left-leaning independents – to consider their alternatives.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With a month to go, Drazan is far from certain to win, but for a Republican to be in a toss-up race for Oregon governor presents the best opportunity the GOP has had <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2010/11/oregon_governor_election_resul.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2010</a>, when Republican Chris Dudley, a former NBA player, <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/news/story?id=5758614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly lost amid that year’s red wave.</a> This time around, we’re <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-still-do-not-show-a-gop-bounce-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not really seeing</a> the same sort of wave developing, but the dynamics of the three-way race combined with the unpopularity of Kotek and Brown may still deliver Republicans a win, ending four decades of futility.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Pennsylvania was supposed to be the Democrats’ insurance policy. The state’s Senate seat is currently held by a Republican, but Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman has comfortably led the race since August. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If Democrats win Pennsylvania</a>, their chance of winning the Senate would be 81 in 100.<a data-footnote-id="34" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All numbers in this article are as of Oct. 5 at 4 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a> It would even allow them to withstand the loss of one of their own Senate seats (say, in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a> or <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a>) and still retain control of the chamber.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But according to three recent polls, Fetterman’s lead is narrowing. According to Suffolk University and USA Today, Fetterman led by <a href="https://www.goerie.com/story/news/politics/state/2022/06/15/suffolk-university-usa-today-poll-pennsylvania-senate-governor-oz-fetterman/65360594007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9 percentage points</a> in June, but a Sept. 27-30 poll gave him a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/04/fetterman-leads-oz-pennsylvania-senate-race/8161323001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-point lead</a>. According to Fox News, Fetterman led by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-oz-supporters-lack-enthusiasm-pennsylvania-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 points</a> in July but by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-pennsylvania-senate-race-narrows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 4 points</a> in a Sept. 22-26 poll. And according to Emerson College, Fetterman was <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/pennsylvania-2022-fetterman-holds-four-point-lead-over-oz-for-us-senate-shapiro-leads-mastriano-by-three/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up 5 points</a> in August but <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/pennsylvania-2022-fettermans-lead-shrinks-in-us-senate-race-shapiros-lead-expands-for-governors-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 2 points</a> in a Sept. 23-26 poll. As a result of these and other polls, Fetterman has gone from an 11-point lead in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a> on Sept. 13 to a 7-point lead today.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="848" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-senate-topline-711-PA-S3-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The shift is due in part to Republicans getting off the fence and supporting the Republican candidate, celebrity physician Mehmet Oz. In the <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/PA-crosstabs_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-July-22-26_released-July-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July Fox News poll</a>, 73 percent of Republicans said they supported Oz, and 13 percent were undecided. In the <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/PA-crosstabs_Sen-Gov-General_conducted-September-22-26_released-September-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent Fox News poll</a>, though, 83 percent of Republicans said they supported Oz, and only 4 percent were undecided. Republicans may have been slow to come around to Oz because he isn’t their ideal candidate. Before jumping into politics, he had taken <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-conservative-policy-pa-senate-race-20220419.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberal positions</a> on issues such as abortion and gun control. Then, earlier this year, he barely survived a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/16-gop-primaries-to-watch-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania-idaho-and-oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nasty Republican primary</a> against David McCormick and Kathy Barnette. And, according to the most recent Fox News poll, only 38 percent of Oz supporters said they supported him enthusiastically. By contrast, 61 percent of Fetterman supporters said they were enthusiastic about their candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, this shift is also because Fetterman is losing support. Per Fox News, he led Oz 58 percent to 30 percent among college-educated voters in July. But in September, Fetterman led just 50 percent to 39 percent among these voters. (By contrast, non-college-educated voters barely changed their minds.) And according to Suffolk, Fetterman led among Black voters 71 percent to 6 percent <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/6_17_2022_pennsylvania_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=0FCA094D69AEFC65E5070CEC5F3FEC2CEA8954F4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June</a>, but that lead shrunk to 56 percent to 22 percent <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/10_4_2022_tables.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=4BD88F8A9A453DD5901885959737AFB0274433BF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in September</a> (17 percent were undecided). This could be because Republican outside groups have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/outside-allies-help-republican-us-senate-candidates-close-gap-with-democrats-2022-10-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent at least $20 million</a> in recent weeks on attack ads against Fetterman, focusing in particular on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/us/politics/fetterman-oz-crime-justice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue of crime</a> and a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/oz-backers-launch-ads-attacking-fetterman-pulling-gun-black-jogger-201-rcna46479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 incident</a> in which Fetterman <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/who-is-john-fetterman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled a shotgun on a Black jogger</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pennsylvania isn’t the only Senate race that has gotten better for Republicans in the past couple of weeks, though: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a> look better for the GOP as well. As a result, Democrats’ <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chances of keeping control of the Senate</a>, which was steadily rising since July, has leveled off and even dipped, from a high of 71 in 100 on Sept. 20 to 67 in 100 today. To be sure, Democrats are still favorites to win Pennsylvania’s Senate seat and the Senate overall. But if Republicans are looking for reasons for optimism, they’re starting to become visible.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">While Hurricane Ian is primarily a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/03/hurricane-ian-live-updates-death-toll-flooding/8163926001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/09/30/hurricane-ian-historical-ranking-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meteorological</a> story, it is also a political story. Ian is the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Gov. Ron DeSantis was elected in 2018.<a data-footnote-id="35" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-35" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, since then, Florida has been hit by a few &lt;a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/uststorms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tropical storms&lt;/a&gt;, tropical cyclones that are weaker than hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>35</sup></a> As a result, it has the potential to be a defining moment for his governorship. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s significant because DeSantis is up for reelection in a month and because he’s rumored to have presidential aspirations in 2024. If Floridians — and Americans — approve of his handling of the storm recovery, it could give him a strong story of leadership to tell on the campaign trail. But if he is seen as bungling the response, it could also imperil his political future. So the question is, will DeSantis’s response to Hurricane Ian boost his political career or derail it?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s too early to answer that question, but historically, governors in DeSantis’s shoes have been met with inconsistent political fates. I looked back at the states hit hardest by the 19 tropical cyclones that caused <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events/US/2000-2022?disasters%5B%5D=tropical-cyclone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $10 billion</a><a data-footnote-id="36" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-36" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In estimated CPI-adjusted costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>36</sup></a> in damage in the U.S. this century and how their governors’ polling numbers changed after the storms. And while the average governor’s approval rating did increase after the storms, most of the time, those increases were minor. (Important caveat: It’s impossible to know whether the storms directly <em>caused</em> those numbers to move; other important events may have affected public opinion during that time, too.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A few governors became significantly more popular after conducting an emergency response to a storm hitting their state. For example, then-Gov. Chris Christie burnished his image by engaging in <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2012/10/obama-christie-unite-for-sandy-damage-tour-083123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan work</a> with then-President Barack Obama after the storm formerly known as<a data-footnote-id="37" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-37" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few hours before landfall, Sandy became a post-tropical cyclone, meaning it could no longer meteorologically be classified as a hurricane. It remained hurricane-strength, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>37</sup></a> Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey in 2012. According to polling that year from <a href="http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2012/goodnumbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairleigh Dickinson University</a>, Christie’s approval rating among registered voters increased from 56 percent before the storm to 77 percent after. And according to Quinnipiac University, then-Gov. Jeb Bush saw his approval rating spike from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release-Legacy?releaseid=313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent</a> to <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release-Legacy?releaseid=405" target="_blank" rel="noopener">62 percent</a> after hurricanes Charley and Frances hit Florida. They made landfall in the state less than a month apart in 2004, and 87 percent of Florida voters approved of Bush’s recovery efforts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But most of the time, storms didn’t seem to change many people’s opinions about their governors — even when they thought their governor did a good job with disaster response. For example, look at North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper after Hurricane Florence in 2018. While 84 percent of registered voters told <a href="https://climatenexus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NC-Poll-Results-10_3_18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Nexus</a> that Cooper’s response to Florence was “good” or “very good,” SurveyUSA found that his approval rating increased from <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=c23131ad-7e15-4068-9655-df1486ef9b7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">49 percent</a> less than five months before the storm to <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=1a828769-6d10-465f-b9ea-1d8169a5210b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53 percent</a> a couple of weeks after it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The electoral track record is also mixed for governors who were running for reelection when a hurricane struck their state (the position DeSantis is in now). For example, in October 2016, <a href="https://www.nccivitas.org/2016/civitas-poll-voters-approve-mccrorys-hurricane-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71 percent</a> of likely North Carolina voters were satisfied with then-Gov. Pat McCrory’s response to Hurricane Matthew. And McCrory appeared to get a bump in <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/governor/nc/north_carolina_governor_mccrory_vs_cooper-4096.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head-to-head polls</a> against Cooper, his Democratic opponent. But that bump was short-lived, and McCrory lost reelection a few weeks later. And, in October 2018, <a href="http://stpetepolls.org/files/StPetePolls_2018_State_GEN_GovSenate_October16_H72F.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61 percent</a> of likely Florida voters approved of how then-Gov. Rick Scott handled the response to Hurricane Michael. But the term-limited Scott fell further behind in his race for U.S. Senate: According to the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>, his chance of winning went from 41 in 100 on the day Michael hit to 32 in 100 two weeks later. But then, surprisingly, Scott won the race in an upset.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So if history is any guide, Hurricane Ian may not significantly affect DeSantis’s approval rating (which, as of August, was an even 50 percent, per the <a href="https://www.unf.edu/uploadedFiles/aa/coas/porl/UNF%20PORL%20August%20Survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Florida</a>) or his chances of winning reelection (which, as of Sept. 28, were 93 in 100, per the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>). But a lot depends on how DeSantis handles the storm’s aftermath. It turns out that voters are pretty rational: <a href="https://andrewreeves.org/papers/rain.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political scientists</a> who have studied this topic have found that voters <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/myopic-voters-and-natural-disaster-policy/039708A3223EC114365ADF56F1D26423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reward incumbents</a> for proactive disaster responses (e.g., delivering relief funds) and <a href="https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/QJPS-9057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punish them</a> for inadequate ones (e.g., not issuing a disaster declaration).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We see this in the real world, too. The governors who became more unpopular after their hurricanes were often those whose responses were the most ineffectual. For example, former Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna9613133#.XoJQ1C3MyLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely criticized</a> for her response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, particularly for waiting too long to order an evacuation and request federal troops for assistance. The state’s recovery from the storm was also <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0605726103" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow</a> and <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/when-half-citys-residents-may-be-homeless-new-orleans-after-katrina/2009-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">painful</a>, and Blanco’s approval rating (per <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollTrack.aspx?g=d971a8e9-e110-4e0f-accb-fffae1b75050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyUSA</a>) fell from 50 percent a couple weeks before the storm to 41 percent a couple weeks after  — and it continued to decline in subsequent months, all the way to 33 percent in December. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The story was similar in Puerto Rico. Six months after Hurricane Maria, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/374880879/La-Encuesta-de-El-Nuevo-Dia-de-marzo-de-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 percent</a> of Puerto Ricans rated Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s response to the hurricane as “good” or “very good,” and his approval rating was about the same as it had been three months before the storm. But as infrastructure remained unrepaired and power outages lingered, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/09/12/feature/residents-see-a-failure-at-all-levels-of-government/?utm_term=.3d2b936de353" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different poll</a> conducted a few months later gave him more mediocre reviews: Only 31 percent rated his response to Maria as “excellent,” “very good,” or “good.” And a year after that, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/19/why-puerto-rico-is-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosselló resigned</a> amid protests sparked by his offensive Telegram messages (some about Maria victims) and primed by general discontent with his administration.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So it’s possible that DeSantis’s disaster response could significantly affect his popularity. However, there is also one big reason to think it will not: Public opinion of him is already very baked in. Per that UNF poll, 45 percent of likely voters strongly approved of DeSantis, and 41 percent strongly disapproved; only 5 percent somewhat approved, and only 7 percent somewhat disapproved. In other words, it appears that DeSantis’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/02/florida-gov-ron-desantis-chastises-students-masks-middleton-usf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pugnacious style</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/28/desantis-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embrace of the culture wars</a> has left few Floridians willing to change their minds about him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-politics-of-disasters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political-science research</a> has found that partisanship affects how people perceive politicians in the wake of natural disasters — which could explain why their polling numbers usually don’t change much. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381607080097" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study</a> found that people are more likely to blame politicians of the opposite party when governments flub hurricane-recovery efforts. If this happens in Florida, maybe Democrats will blame DeSantis, but Republicans will not and could instead take out their frustration on President Biden. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/29/how-many-votes-could-hurricane-harvey-cost-trump-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another study</a> found that voters of the incumbent’s party tend to reward that incumbent after natural disasters, while voters of the opposite party tend to punish them. In other words, the natural disaster just confirmed the voters’ partisan biases. It’s not hard to imagine the same thing happening with DeSantis.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">For Democrats, North Carolina has recently been more of a white whale than a bird in hand. No Democrat has won a statewide federal race there since 2008, when former President Barack Obama narrowly <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=37&amp;year=2008&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the state</a> by less than 1 percentage point, and the late Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=37&amp;year=2008&amp;f=0&amp;off=3&amp;elect=0&amp;class=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried the state by a little over 8 points</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s not like North Carolina is a solidly red state. It has a partisan lean of R+4.8, putting it in the company of other swing states with competitive Senate races like Wisconsin and Nevada. Since 2008, Democrats have been successful at the statewide level, with wins in both the <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/North_Carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s</a> and <a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2020/11/17/josh-stein-wins-re-election-attorney-general-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general’s</a> races in 2016 and 2020. But despite some incredibly close, single-digit margins in U.S. Senate races in both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/north-carolina-senate-burr-ross" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/cal-cunningham-concedes-to-senator-thom-tillis-in-north-carolina.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a>, Tar Heel Democrats haven’t been able to break through since Hagan’s win in 2008.<a data-footnote-id="38" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-38" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hagan &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/north-carolina-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lost her reelection bid&lt;/a&gt; to Republican Sen. Thom Tillis in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>38</sup></a> In other words, futile efforts to recreate the magic of 2008 in North Carolina — at least in presidential and U.S. Senate races — <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/North_Carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have consistently fallen flat</a>. And although this year’s Senate race could be the leap Democrats are hoping for, it’s likely, at least according to our metrics, to be another disappointment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s midterm election forecast</a>, Republican Rep. Ted Budd currently has around a 2-in-3 chance of beating Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former chief justice of the state Supreme Court, to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr.<a data-footnote-id="39" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-39" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Oct. 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>39</sup></a> That doesn’t mean the race is a done deal: Our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> shows a much more competitive race, with the most recent surveys showing the two candidates neck and neck.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the idea that the race could be close shouldn’t comfort Democrats too much. North Carolina is no stranger to close Senate matchups. In fact, in the past three Senate elections, the Democratic candidate has never lost by more than 6 percentage points. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">So given Democrats’ struggles to win federal races in the state, let’s run through a couple reasons why Beasley could be the first federal candidate in almost 15 years to win a statewide race — and why she could be yet another Democrat to narrowly lose a Senate race in North Carolina. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For starters, Beasley, who already has experience <a href="https://www.wunc.org/politics/2014-11-25/justice-cheri-beasley-unofficially-wins-re-count-in-race-for-nc-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running and winning a statewide race</a> in North Carolina, has so far maintained a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/NC/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant financial edge</a> over Budd. Her impressive fundraising skills have allowed her to spend over $10 million on TV ads, according to <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/senate/race/231026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cook Political Report</a>, which cited data from AdImpact. That’s in contrast to nearly $2 million from Budd, according to the outlet. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beasley is also hoping that the state’s demographics will work in her favor. She <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2022/9/22/23366566/cheri-beasley-inspiring-voters-north-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t been shy in admitting</a> that she hopes she can gin up support among Black voters, who make up <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/NC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 22 percent</a> of the citizen voting-age population. And if Beasley wins, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2022/09/21/black-voters-will-play-an-outsize-role-key-southern-senate-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she’d become</a> the state’s first Black U.S. senator. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The Democratic Party has been trying hard to put forward candidates who reflect the diversity of the country,” said <a href="https://www.meredith.edu/directory/whitney-manzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitney Manzo</a>, a professor of political science at North Carolina’s Meredith College. “And I think the party is banking on [Beasley] appealing to voters of color, with the hope that she will energize voters in the same way that Barack Obama did in 2008.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The increased salience of abortion access following the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might also give Beasley a lift</a> — something that other Democrats in competitive states are similarly hoping for.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe loading="lazy" title="Abortion Access In North Carolina Might Hinge On 5 Seats In The State Legislature | FiveThirtyEight" width="712" height="401" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VMDcqCEswU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In a September <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/north-carolina-2022-three-point-race-for-us-senate-overturning-of-roe-v-wade-makes-majority-more-likely-to-vote-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College</a> poll of likely North Carolina voters, 59 percent of respondents said they were much <em>more</em> likely to vote in the 2022 elections due to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Twelve percent of respondents also said that abortion was their No. 1 issue heading into the midterm elections — a figured dwarfed by the 41 percent who identified the economy as their key issue. Still, considering the tightening race between Beasley and Budd, abortion access alone might be enough to give the Democrat a significant edge at the polls. Beasley, for her part, <a href="https://www.wunc.org/politics/2022-09-23/budd-embraces-trump-abortion-opposition-nc-senate-race-2022-beasley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has repeatedly contrasted</a> her and Budd’s views on abortion access to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/cheri-beasley-politicians-step-abortion-031849882.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobilize her base</a>. Manzo added that abortion rights in particular could help Beasley woo Republican women — particularly those living in the state’s cities and large metros — who weren’t in favor of the Supreme Court’s decision.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But there are arguably more factors working <em>against</em> the Democrat. For one, even though Budd has trailed Beasley in fundraising, he’s received <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NCS2&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an onslaught of outside help</a> that Beasley just hasn’t seen so far. <a href="https://twitter.com/cheribeasleync/status/1567549455930359809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earlier this month</a>, the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, began running ads against Beasley <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00571703/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that are said to total</a> $16 million. Meanwhile, the equivalent Democratic spending arm, helmed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, <a href="https://www.wral.com/democratic-group-spends-1-3m-to-help-beasley-in-nc/20296625/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t spent nearly</a> as much on Beasley. <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00484642/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent estimates show</a> that the Democratic Senate PAC has spent a little under $2 million supporting Beasley and another $2.7 million opposing Budd. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This Senate race has kind of been a sleeper or second-tier kind of a race. It feels like North Carolina and Florida have taken a backseat to Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio and Wisconsin,” said <a href="https://catawba.edu/michael-bitzer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Bitzer</a>, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College, which is also located in North Carolina. “To me, it seems like Beasley is doing everything she needs to do to be competitive and potentially win. But without a financial investment from the Democratic Party, I’m not sure that she’s going to make it across the finish line.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The high number of unaffiliated voters in North Carolina could also work against the Democrat. According to a 2022 study by the <a href="https://www.ncdemography.org/2022/05/09/unaffiliated-voter-shifts-in-nc-and-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, over 2.4 million of the state’s registered voters (about one-third of the electorate) are not affiliated with either major political party. According to Manzo, these voters <em>do </em>tend to fall somewhere between Republicans and Democrats, but <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bliss/docs/State-of-the-Parties-2021/bitzer-cooper-manzo-roberts-sop21-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veer slightly more conservative</a>. “I would not see the unaffiliated population of North Carolina as a giant pool of potential support for Cheri Beasley,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">North Carolina has also seen an increase in its nonwhite population from 2000 through 2018, according to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2020/09/23/the-changing-racial-and-ethnic-composition-of-the-u-s-electorate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>. In 2018, 31 percent of North Carolina’s eligible voters were nonwhite — an increase of 6 percentage points over the course of almost two decades.<strong> </strong>While, in theory, this trend <em>should</em> boost Democrats, who tend to do better with nonwhite voters, demographics are not destiny in American politics, and it’s not clear that Democrats are making inroads with these groups. In 2020, more Hispanic voters in North Carolina <a href="https://hispanicvote.univision.com/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were registered</a> as independent/other (89,958) than Democrats (85,538) or Republicans (43,126). Asian American voters in the state <a href="https://ncaatogether.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-ncaat-demographic-report-online-11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are largely unaffiliated</a>, too, but lean Democratic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, of course, while North Carolina does have a large Black voting-age population, there hasn’t been a concerted effort to get these voters to the polls, according to Bitzer. “In Georgia, you saw very focused and intentional registration and mobilization efforts helmed by Stacey Abrams,” he said. “But nobody’s really done something equivalent in North Carolina. Some groups have been trying, but there hasn’t been that real long-term investment and focus that I think differentiates North Carolina from Georgia.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, white voters are even harder for Democrats to win. While exit polls in recent elections suggest that white voters in North Carolina are somewhat less firmly in the GOP camp than in, say, Georgia, they still lean quite Republican. In 2016, former President Donald Trump won 63 percent of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/nc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white voters in North Carolina</a> compared with Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 32 percent. That same year <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Georgia</a>, however, he won white voters by a much larger margin: 75 percent to 21 percent. In the last presidential election, however, President Biden narrowly improved on Clinton’s margin among white voters in Georgia (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 percent to Trump’s 69 percent</a>), but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/north-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t improve much</a> in North Carolina, only winning 33 percent of the state’s white voters compared to Trump’s 66 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plus, North Carolina has a large number of voters who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/fight-evangelical-voters-could-be-crucial-north-carolina-n1245746" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are evangelical Protestants</a>, who are both <a href="https://wthh.dataforprogress.org/blog/2018/11/5/understanding-white-evangelicals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to both vote Republican</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-big-chunk-of-white-americans-with-degrees-and-people-of-color-are-behind-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have conservative attitudes</a> toward certain racial issues. According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/north-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exit poll data from CNN</a>, about one-third (35 percent) of North Carolina’s voters identified as born-again or evangelical Christians in 2020. Of that number, 86 percent backed Trump, compared with 14 percent who supported Biden. “Particularly in rural North Carolina and in the surrounding suburban counties, they make up a core constituency of the base of the Republican Party in the state,” Bitzer said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, lastly, similar to other Democrats in competitive races this fall, Biden’s low approval ratings could drag down Beasley. According to a September <a href="https://www.highpoint.edu/blog/2022/09/hpu-poll-presidential-approval-at-34-governor-approval-at-44-in-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">High Point University</a> poll, only 34 percent of North Carolinians said they approved of Biden’s job performance as president. More than half of surveyed residents (53 percent) said they disapprove of the job Biden is doing. (It’s worth noting, though, that Beasley did run about <a href="https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/03/2020&amp;county_id=0&amp;office=FED&amp;contest=1373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.4 points ahead of Biden</a> in 2020, when she lost reelection as Supreme Court Chief Justice <a href="https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/03/2020&amp;county_id=0&amp;office=JUD&amp;contest=1375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 401 total votes</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the end, we still expect this race to be a close one given past Senate margins in North Carolina, and the fact that Beasley is a fairly strong candidate. That September Emerson College survey found Budd and Beasley practically neck and neck in terms of their favorability numbers: Forty-eight percent of voters in North Carolina had a favorable view of the Republican compared with 46 percent who felt the same way about Beasley. Their unfavorability numbers were about the same, too: Thirty-eight percent viewed Budd unfavorably versus 40 percent for Beasley. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So all hope isn’t lost for Beasley. Since Democrats’ dreams of winning a North Carolina Senate race since 2008 has been a sort of pipe dream, it’s unclear whether she can pull through. But the possibility is still there. “In this state, anything could happen,” Bitzer told me. “So who knows?”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday night, The Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-life-herschel-walker-paid-for-girlfriends-abortion-georgia-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia who has said he wants to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/herschel-walker-supports-total-abortion-ban-no-exception-georgia-senate-2022-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban abortion in all circumstances</a>, had paid for his pregnant then-girlfriend to get an abortion in 2009.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Walker is currently locked in a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toss-up race</a> with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock for a seat that could decide control of the Senate. According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s midterm forecast</a>, Georgia is the most likely “tipping-point” state in the chamber — i.e., the state most likely to give Republicans or Democrats their majority. To give you a sense of how crucial it is: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If Republicans win Georgia</a>, we estimate they would have a 60-in-100 chance of winning the Senate. But if Democrats win the state, we estimate they’d have an 89-in-100 chance of winning the chamber.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The question is, how much will this controversy hurt Walker? Given the salaciousness of the story and the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/herschel-walker-pledges-to-sue-over-abortion-claim/RLTO2CSSMJDS3MPG3SZEZLQAMM/?p" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turmoil it has reportedly plunged his campaign into</a>, it’s tempting to think it might torpedo his chances. But that’s hardly a guarantee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It is true that scandals tangibly affect candidates’ chances of winning elections. I keep a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ksBLxRR3GCZd33IvhkcNqqBd5K8HwlWC7YuAkVmS1lg/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database of scandals</a>, and based on an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-scandals-hurt-candidates-running-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis we did in 2018</a>, we found that scandal-plagued incumbents did 9 percentage points worse in their next general election than they would otherwise be projected to do. That analysis included a variety of factors such as the candidate’s previous margin of victory, the partisan lean of their district, generic-ballot polling, congressional approval ratings and the incumbent’s congressional voting record. This finding led us to include whether or not a candidate faces a scandal as a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">variable in our midterm forecast</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this new revelation about Walker, who has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-gop-senate-herschel-walker-denies-report-paid-girlfriends-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied the allegation</a>, hasn’t affected our forecast of the Georgia Senate race — at least not yet. That’s because, for one, it doesn’t meet <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-heres-how-we-decide-whos-involved-in-a-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our definition of a scandal</a>. As our forecast defines it, a scandal is a credible accusation of objective criminal or ethical wrongdoing. While Walker’s decision to pay for an abortion may have been hypocritical, it wasn’t illegal. And if being hypocritical were enough to qualify as “scandal-tarred,” most politicians would be slapped with the label!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, Walker has already been tagged with the scandal variable. Before and during his campaign, multiple previous scandals that meet our definition have come out. Walker’s ex-wife accused him of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatening to kill her</a> and was granted a protective order against him in 2005. He and a business partner were sued after <a href="https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/state/georgia/article258250315.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failing to repay $625,000 in loans</a>. Democrats have <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/complaint-herschel-walker-violated-campaign-law/85-fcab4a1a-fa19-4182-98c4-f5f249be01a1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused him</a> of multiple <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/georgia-democrats-accuse-walker-of-violating-campaign-finance-rules/FVWKQ6WJQJDPZE3ICEYJTHDBKM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign-finance violations</a>. And in June, The Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-says-hes-a-model-dad-he-has-a-secret-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Walker had fathered <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/herschel-walker-critic-of-absentee-dads-admits-to-yet-another-secret-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three children</a> he had not previously publicly acknowledged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But right now, the scandal variable barely impacts our forecast. Only 6 percent of the Deluxe forecast for Georgia Senate is based on the “fundamentals,” which include variables like scandals, Georgia’s partisan lean, Warnock’s incumbency and candidate fundraising. That’s because Georgia is a very heavily polled state. And because we have so many polls and it is relatively close to Election Day, almost 60 percent of the forecast is based on survey data.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, of course, because this story is so recent, none of these polls account for Walker’s abortion controversy. The bad press Walker is receiving may very well damage his standing with voters. The story has already spurred Walker’s adult son Christian, a conservative social-media celebrity, to post critical <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianWalk1r/status/1577101530586484736?s=20&amp;t=7p_NJCrYU-fTaiGalNb69Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweets</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianWalk1r/status/1577284445367042049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a> about the candidate (including one in which he accused Walker of “<a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianWalk1r/status/1577104266543497216?s=20&amp;t=7p_NJCrYU-fTaiGalNb69Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatening to kill us</a>”), which could keep Walker’s unsavory personal life in the news. And he doesn’t need to drop 9 points in the polls for this all to have an impact: According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average of the race</a>, Warnock is currently polling 2 points ahead of Walker, so even if the controversy doesn’t <em>hurt</em> Walker, if it prevents him from <em>gaining</em>, that’s a problem for the Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But on the other hand, there might not be many voters left to turn on Walker. Democrats have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbhqF21eyhg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">airing ads</a> <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-whats-at-stake-in-the-warnock-walker-debate/HWZOLTPWIZBXDOGBCBGBSWSDDM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for weeks</a> reminding voters of Walker’s past scandals. And Georgia is also a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly inelastic state</a>, meaning it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t have a lot of swing voters</a>. The National Republican Senatorial Committee <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshKraushaar/status/1577135306402168833?s=20&amp;t=xM87JheBzBY9QzNNqhBXQQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also said</a> it will continue campaigning hard in Georgia. Many Republican and Republican-leaning voters in Georgia may feel that too much is at stake (i.e., control of the Senate) for this latest allegation to sway their vote. And, as we wrote in 2018, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisanship-often-trumps-scandal-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisanship often trumps scandal</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As always, we’ll need to wait and see to know for sure how public opinion will change in response to this story. You can bet that we’ll keep an extra close eye on Georgia polling for the next few weeks.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In most midterm years, young voters tend to sit out the election. But 2022 could be a different kind of year. Turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds <a href="https://about.bgov.com/brief/election-demographics-and-voter-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly doubled between the 2014 and 2018 midterm cycles</a>. And the Supreme Court’s June ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which allows states to ban abortion for the first time in nearly five decades, suddenly put a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-have-swung-toward-democrats-since-the-dobbs-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotlight on reproductive-health issues</a> in many key elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could motivate the country’s youngest voters — particularly women — to turn out in higher numbers. A <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/gender-generation-and-abortion-shifting-politics-and-perspectives-after-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large, recently released survey</a> from the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life shows that women between age 18 and 29 are especially likely to say not only that they’re following news about abortion rights and access closely but also that abortion is a critical issue for them.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AEI’s American Perspectives Survey was conducted Aug. 12-21 among a random sample of 5,049 U.S. adults using the &lt;a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ipsos KnowledgePanel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>24</sup></a> They’re also more likely than young men to say that they’re single-issue voters on abortion.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even though young women appear to be following politics more closely than they were before the Dobbs decision, it may be harder for Democrats to mobilize them now than it was even a month or two ago. Since the summer, abortion appears to have become a less prominent issue. Data from the ongoing <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey</a> using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a> indicates that the share of Americans who say they have heard a lot about abortion in the news declined from August to September.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all five waves of our ongoing panel survey conducted between April and September, respondents were asked whether they had seen a lot of coverage of the 20 major issues we asked about in the past month, including “other” and “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> And probably not unrelatedly, the share of Americans who say that abortion is one of the most important issues facing the country fell over that period as well, after peaking in July.<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all five waves of our ongoing panel survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write which issue or issues were most important to them, and two multiple-choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20 (including “other” or “none of these”) that they were personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. The sample is weighted to match the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Experts told me, though, that young women’s reaction to living in a country with increasingly limited abortion access might take a while to take shape. Because fewer young voters usually turn out in <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/2018-youth-voter-turnout-increased-every-state#arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">midterm elections</a> than in <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/our-research/broadening-youth-voting#youth-voting-in-recent-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presidential elections</a>, we may not feel the full impact of Dobbs among this group right away — particularly if Republicans succeed in restricting abortion in purple states like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/will-abortion-stay-legal-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/abortion-access-in-north-carolina-might-hinge-on-5-seats-in-the-state-legislature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/youngkins-office-says-no-plans-for-abortion-bill-at-special-session-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia</a> in upcoming legislative sessions. So this year’s elections represent the first test of how young women are responding to the Supreme Court’s decision and its aftermath.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, women and men don’t tend to think about abortion very differently — with the exception of the youngest generation of women. According to the Survey Center on American Life’s American Perspectives Survey, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of women between 18 and 29 think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 56 percent of men in the same age group and 52 percent of women 65 or over. The “most” versus “all” distinction is important because smaller shares tend to think that abortion should always be legal, with no limitations at all. But nearly half (48 percent) of 18- to 29-year-old women think abortion should be legal in <em>all</em> circumstances, compared with only 34 percent of both 18- to 29-year-old men and women 65 or over. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/abortion-stay-legal-pennsylvania-fivethirtyeight-89543566</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And young women have been paying attention to the news, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 states have successfully banned nearly all abortions</a> over the past few months. Sixty-four percent of 18- to 29-year-old women say they’re following news about abortion laws and restrictions very or somewhat closely — more than the share who say they’re closely following news about gas prices and inflation (55 percent) or the 2022 midterm elections (25 percent). Young women are also much likelier than Americans as a whole to say that abortion is a critical issue for them personally, by 61 percent to 36 percent. That’s true compared with other women, too: Only 34 percent of women 65 or over say that abortion is a critical issue for them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Young women are much likelier to say abortion is a critical issue" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aAByO/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="386" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The survey raises an intriguing possibility: that young women are likelier than their older counterparts to see the Supreme Court’s ruling, and the ensuing scramble to ban abortion in red states, as an attack on <em>all</em> women and not just a new set of restrictions on a medical procedure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The researchers asked a set of questions designed to gauge whether people think of themselves as part of a distinct group, where things that happen to other people like them matter for them as well. The findings suggest that women who believe that what happens to other women in the U.S. affects their lives too were far likelier than women who don’t feel those connections to support abortion rights. Young women, meanwhile, were especially likely to feel a sense of linked fate with other women. About two-thirds (67 percent) of 18- to 29-year-old women said that everything or most things that happen to other women affected them too, compared with only 36 percent of women 65 or over. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young women seem to feel a more acute sense of discrimination in general. The vast majority (82 percent) of women 65 or over say that people don’t treat them any differently because of their gender, whereas a much smaller majority (54 percent) of young women say the same. And 39 percent of young women say they think people treat them worse because of their gender.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><p data-paragraph="main">Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/abortion-access-north-carolina-hinge-seats-state-legislature-90385347</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, young women might be more likely than other demographic groups to feel that their own lives could be affected by abortion bans. Of course, women between 18 and 29 do make up <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-abortion-has-changed-since-1973/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large share of women</a> who get abortions, but the number of abortions performed in the U.S. every year is relatively small — suggesting that this sense of shared consequences could make this issue feel especially personal for young women, particularly in the short term. “I could imagine a woman in her 20s looking at the cost of child care, the difficulty of being a parent, and thinking, ‘Being able to get an abortion is something that really matters for women,’” said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University-Camden and the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bad news for Democrats is that there are signs that abortion may be fading as a priority, even for younger women. The American Perspectives Survey was conducted in August, but it’s possible that if the same questions were asked today, enthusiasm around the issue of abortion might be lower. According to the ongoing FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll, shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling, 29 percent of reproductive-aged women (ages 18-44) said that abortion was one of the top three issues facing the country — a substantially higher share than women 45 or over (18 percent), men between 18 and 44 (18 percent), and men 45 or over (12 percent).<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on five waves of a 2022 FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos panel survey drawn from a sample of up to 2,006 adults. Each sample was weighted to match the general population. Respondents could select up to three issues from a list of 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> But since then, the issue has lost some steam. Even among reproductive-aged women, only 12 percent listed abortion as one of their highest priorities in the most recent wave of the survey, conducted Sept. 6-19.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Abortion isn't as high a priority for some younger women" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Aqq03/12/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="368" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">That trend probably has something to do with Americans’ hearing less about abortion in the news now than in the summer. The FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos survey found that the share of reproductive-aged women who said they’d heard a lot about abortion in the news dropped from 70 percent just after the Dobbs ruling to 47 percent in September. So a lot could depend on whether stories about people who can’t get abortions even in dire circumstances — like the <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2022/07/14/what-know-10-year-old-rape-survivor-and-columbus-man-arrested-indiana-abortion/10057679002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-year-old rape survivor who had to travel</a> from Ohio to Indiana for an abortion in July — make their way back into the headlines over the coming month. And then there’s the fact that only 25 percent of young women in the American Perspectives Survey said they were following news about the midterm elections very closely, suggesting that their concern about abortion rights may not translate into enthusiasm to vote in the upcoming elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Mary-Kate Lizotte, an Augusta University political scientist who studies women’s political participation, said that the abrupt restrictions on abortion access could end up being a generation-defining event, even if young women don’t dramatically reshape the outcome of the midterms. After all, only a handful of races will determine which party controls Congress — not all of them statewide — and these <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/24/voter-turnout-always-drops-off-for-midterm-elections-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elections generally get less attention</a> than in presidential years. Whether or not the issue brings a lot of young women to the polls in key races, she said, the Supreme Court’s decision and the bans that followed are likely to shape young women’s views of the GOP for years to come, solidifying their antipathy to the party as they grow older and start voting more regularly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“For a lot of voters, particularly young women who are going to be impacted in a very real way, this is going to be one of the first times that they really cared about something when it comes to politics,” said Lizotte. “That’s going to anchor the way many [young women] view the parties — not just in 2022, but in 2024 and beyond.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It was one of the big puzzles of the 2020 election: Why did Latino voters — who <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/389093/hispanic-americans-party-updated-analysis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically lean Democratic</a> — <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23277397/latino-voters-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swing toward former President Donald Trump</a>? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Was it his <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-white-house-hispanic-prosperity-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise of economic prosperity</a> for Latino Americans? After all, the No. 1 issue for Hispanic registered voters — like the broader electorate — that year was <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/11/hispanic-voters-say-economy-health-care-and-covid-19-are-top-issues-in-2020-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy</a>, according to the Pew Research Center. Or could it have been his <a href="https://time.com/5928808/trump-border-wall-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledge to construct a border wall</a> and enforce a type of “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/17/to-understand-donald-trumps-law-and-order-appeal-look-south-of-the-border/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law and order</a>” along the U.S.-Mexico border, which might have appealed to <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/democrats-losing-texas-latinos-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain Southern voters, particularly those in Texas?</a> It’s still not entirely clear.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The upcoming midterm elections will test the durability of Republican gains — and Democratic losses — among this key group. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/-clock-ticking-democrats-defense-republicans-pursue-latino-voters-rcna16745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Both parties</a> are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/15/democrats-ramp-up-efforts-win-over-hispanic-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubling down on their efforts</a> to appeal to Latino Americans. But perhaps the most important lesson from 2020 was that Latino voters — the country’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23277397/latino-voters-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest-growing voting bloc</a> — can’t be painted with a broad brush. “We’re a growing percentage of the population, and, over time, we’ve become even more important to the parties,” said Georgiana Hernandez, 66, of New Mexico. “But I don’t see Latinos as monolithic. And in tight races, any movement you can get among the racial groups is important. It all comes down to being attuned to our needs and appealing to issues that are important to people of different stripes.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, I wanted to see what was on the minds of five Latino voters in the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections. Unsurprisingly, and as the chart below illustrates, a range of policies are top of mind for Latino voters when it comes to deciding who they’ll cast a ballot for. </p>

 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">While, like for all Americans, economic issues like inflation and cost of living are still Latino voters’ No. 1 concern, according a recent NALEO poll, abortion rights and health care were also top of mind for a number of surveyed respondents. (This range of priorities was reflected in my interviews, too.)  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But when it comes to the top issue on the minds of Latino Americans, neither party has a clear advantage. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/poll-abortion-trump-boost-midterm-prospects-democrats-rcna48173" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As the chart below suggests</a>, respondents are almost evenly split on which party they trust more on economic issues. They tend to favor Democrats over Republicans, however, on other issues, like immigration and gun policy, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-gops-grievance-politics-might-not-turn-off-conservative-latino-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my reporting also suggests</a> that many Latinos are more socially conservative, which could be a problem for Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Latino voters agree more with Democrats on some issues" aria-label="Split Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r2RDK/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="365" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, this is why polling on Latino voters is often so hard to gauge — like all voters, they hold different, often competing, priorities. And in speaking to these five people, I wanted to get a better grip on these complexities as we move closer to Election Day. I learned that these Latino voters want the parties to treat them as a complex, multifaceted voting bloc — and they’re aware of the power they wield. As Hernandez told me: “Latinos can really swing things one way or the other, so it’s no surprise to me that our votes are considered competitive.”</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: What are the most important issues to you heading into the midterm elections?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Carlos Ruiz (58, Arizona, Republican): The economy and inflation are the most important issues to me, but I’m also prioritizing the lack of control on the border. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Alicia Bejarano (19, South Carolina, Libertarian): This year, I’m going to be looking closely at what candidates have to say about gun reform and their reaction to the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade. I’m also interested in issues related to policing and police accountability. I don’t know whether I have strong feelings about the police being defunded, but, at least currently, I feel like law enforcement isn’t capable of de-escalating situations in a way that doesn’t lead to more violence or death. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jaime Vasquez (20, Texas, Republican): My top concern right now is making sure that Americans get to keep our natural rights as they’re recognized in the Constitution. It’s important to realize that without the Second Amendment, there can be no First Amendment. My No. 2 issue is the economy, since I have concerns about increased government spending by the Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Diana Agapay (42, Florida, Democrat): My top issue going into the midterms is expanding abortion access and improving health care access for women. My second top issue is investigating any previous presidential administration that has done anything illegal and making sure that they go through our existing criminal justice system — as any <em>non</em>-government figure would. And the third top issue for me is probably inflation, but I think that’ll eventually calm down.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Georgiana Hernandez (66, New Mexico, Democrat): There are three: One is climate change, which I’ve been very concerned about for quite a while. The second is reproductive rights. And the third is voting rights.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Can you reflect a bit on your mood going into this election and whether it’s different from two years ago?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: I don’t feel any more enthusiastic for this election than I was in 2020. Two years ago, I quickly realized what the election meant — and the importance of it. Even though [Republicans] were in power at the time, the election felt like an inflection point because the race could have swung either way. And I still feel that way heading into this year’s midterm elections. We’re still at a crossroads, it seems, and there’s the same level of enthusiasm to go and vote [this year] — at least on my part.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: I’m more anxious about the midterm elections than I was for the elections in 2020. Don’t get me wrong, 2020 was very anxiety inducing, but I feel like the stakes are much higher now for Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: During the 2020 election, Latino voters moved further right. Why do you think that happened? Have you personally moved more toward Republicans since 2016; if so, why? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: I’ve been a registered Republican since I was 18 — which would’ve been around the Reagan era. But I think the economic prosperity from 2016 through 2020 was across the board and that Hispanics saw a more open, unregulated economy with lower taxes that allowed more people to either increase their wages or grow their businesses. As a result, I think people moved more toward Republicans and the political philosophy that supports that kind of economic environment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: I didn’t necessarily move right since 2016, and I can’t speak for all Latino voters, but I can speak from experience when saying this: I come from a Hispanic family, and a majority of them are Republicans. In the Hispanic community, there’s this ‘bootstrap’ ideology among people who immigrated to the United States that you have to ‘do the work’ to get here. I’ve noticed that in my family, and in talks with other Hispanic families, we have this sense of responsibility and honor. And that honor arises from the fact that we all came into this country ‘the right way.’ Then you have Republicans who are basically saying, ‘Yes, that’s exactly what we want.’ I’m personally not drawn to that bootstrap ideology, but since Republicans are the main ones saying it, I can understand why some Hispanics moved toward them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: My views are still the same as they were in 2016, but I think I’ve become more bold and open in my support for Republicans. My family and I have been a small minority in South Texas because it has been blue for decades, and we were always that one Republican family in the neighborhood that felt like our vote didn’t matter. But, in 2020, things shifted here, and my area — and the Rio Grande Valley, more broadly — swung pretty heavily toward Republicans. The fact that the politics down here changed so much in just four years was pretty shocking, to be honest. I’m not really sure what attributed to the switch, but I can make some guesses: South Texas, especially the RGV, is still very much rooted in traditional values similar to what many conservative voices in the Republican Party advocate. I also think that Democrats moving further left on social issues, particularly the ‘defund the police’ narrative, turned off voters who had families working in law enforcement or border patrol.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Agapay: I did not move toward Republicans at all. If anything, I’ve moved more left. I do have thoughts, though, on why some Latino voters may have moved toward Republicans. I’m a first-generation American, both of my parents immigrated to this country, and I believe that Latinos tend to be more conservative, especially when it comes to their faith. I also think that Republicans use fear-based messaging in their attempts to target Latino voters and, in a sense, have convinced some of us to be fearful of Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: As of today, do you lean more toward the Democratic Party, the Republican Party or neither? And what, if anything, would it take for you to support the opposing party? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: The Republican Party. But if a Republican candidate had what I would call a very fringe philosophy and a Democratic candidate was more centrist, that might cause me to vote for the Democrat. But if I had a choice between a person that had fringe philosophies on the left and fringe philosophies on the right, I’d probably just not vote in that race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: In terms of issues like gun reform, police accountability and my disapproval over the overturning of Roe — those are issues that I trust the Democrats on more. So, for the moment, you could say I have nothing against Democrats because we have a lot of the same values. That said, I’m not Democratic nor Republican: I’m a Libertarian. And in order for me to support Republicans, I’d need to see their grip on the interpretation of the Constitution loosen a bit to allow for new ideas to flourish that would better accommodate our modern society.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: Definitely Republicans. I don’t think there’s anything that Democrats and I currently see eye-to-eye on, so I’m not sure there’s anything that could convince me to vote for them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Agapay: The Democratic Party, but I could probably support a Republican candidate who’s actually going to be truthful and stand up to the nonsense that has been coming out of the Republican Party for the past six years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: Definitely the Democratic Party. I don’t see myself ever supporting a Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Why do you think Latino voters are such a coveted bloc for both major political parties?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: We are a large population but, historically, our voting propensity is not that high. And if Latino voters could be encouraged to cast their ballots more frequently, then all of a sudden both parties would look at them as a large, more competitive voting bloc as they do with other races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: As bad as it sounds, I think both parties just want to say that they have the minority vote. They see it as, ‘Oh, these are the honest and good people that worked hard to get here.’ But that alone is not sound logic and is not a good enough reason alone for them to court Latino voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: I think it has to do with the changing demographics of the country over the last two censuses. Since at least 2010, there’s been a dramatic increase in the Hispanic population. And bringing more Hispanic voters into your tent could really change the dynamics of each party’s politics — Republicans especially. There has always been this narrative that Republicans are anti-minority, and they have a big opportunity to change that if they get more Hispanic voters on their side. Meanwhile, the Democrats have always tried to tout themselves as the pro-minority party, so they probably want to maintain that talking point because they think it makes them seem, in my opinion, more morally virtuous. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Agapay: For the simple fact that we are growing in numbers. Plus, I think Latino voters finally realized that we have a voice and that we can use our voice to sway elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: How could each party better appeal to Latino voters? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: I grew up middle-class: My father was a heavy equipment operator and my mom was an office worker, but all of my siblings and I went to college and we became more successful than our parents had. That’s the American Dream, and Democrats would do a bit better if they sent a similar kind of message to Latinos that the American Dream is possible through hard work and education. And I think Republicans have improved their messaging on immigration to be less offensive, but some of the language there should be centered more on the needs of our country versus talking about specific groups of people coming in.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: They need to go to the places where we are. Whenever I hear about politicians traveling, they’re always going to Texas or California or Florida because there happen to be large swaths of Latinos living there. But, in addition, they should also go visit places like South Carolina. I certainly didn’t expect to find anyone here of my same heritage, but we <em>do </em>have a foundation; and both parties could do a better job at tapping into Latino populations in other, smaller, states. Both parties could also do a better job at talking with younger Hispanics between the ages of 19 and 25. I feel like we’re not as readily acknowledged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: I think both sides could do a better job at listening to what Latino voters are asking for, but that will differ depending on where we live. For example, Latino voters living in more rural areas may have different needs than those, say, living in large urban or suburban areas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Recent polling shows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/politics/latino-vote-polling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that the economy</a> is a top issue for Latino voters. Which party do you agree with more on economic issues, and why?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bejarano: I’m more frugal with money, which, as I understand, is more in line with the Republican Party’s way of thinking.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: I definitely agree with the conservative point of view, which takes a more laissez-faire [economic] approach, coincided with limited government spending and lower taxes on individuals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: I definitely agree more with the Democratic Party. I think that President Biden has done as much as he can do to try to lower gasoline prices, but there’s a lot that’s not in his control as far as supply chain issues go. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are there other issues where you trust one party over the other? If so, what are those issues?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ruiz: On crime, I trust the Republicans more. And even though this is more of a local issue, I think housing affordability is something that the Democrats would be a little bit better at addressing because they might be more creative with planning and zoning.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vasquez: On crime and immigration, I trust the Republican Party more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hernandez: I trust the Democratic Party to do what’s in the best interest of the American people overall. I have no faith in the Republican Party, and that’s why I’m nervous for this election — I can’t bear to think about the potential consequences if we lose both the House and Senate.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the time of this recording, 62 deaths have been recorded as a result of Hurricane Ian, and that number is expected to rise. Natural disasters — particularly hurricanes — have long shaped public perception of both politicians and climate policy. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew breaks down how the handling of Hurricane Ian could reflect on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and how climate change policy has become more popular among Americans impacted by destructive weather events.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The team is also joined by Tia Mitchell, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Washington correspondent, to discuss a listener question that goes beyond the midterm forecast model: Could President Biden really enact more of his policy agenda if just two more Democratic senators were elected?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, they analyze why Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is backing the new Electoral Count Reform Act and when the new bill will be voted on in the Senate.</p>
