<p data-paragraph="main">A groundbreaking new election structure. The 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee. Santa Claus. What <em>doesn’t</em> the special election for Alaska’s U.S. House seat have?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Well, a winner. This Saturday is technically <a href="https://elections.alaska.gov/specialelections.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election day</a> for the first round of the special election, which is being held to replace legendary former Rep. Don Young, the longest-serving Republican in House history who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/obituaries/don-young-obituary-alaska.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed away on March 18</a>. But because the election is being conducted predominantly by mail and ballots don’t need to be received until June 21, we won’t know which candidates have advanced to the second round until later in the month. And, of course, we won’t know who actually wins the seat until after the general election date of <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2022/03/22/alaska-special-election-to-fill-don-young-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aug. 16</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the primary is plenty interesting on its own. First of all, it will winnow a field of <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/candidatelistspecprim.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">48 candidates</a>(!) down to four. Why four and not two? Because following the passage of an <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/11/17/alaska-becomes-second-state-to-approve-ranked-choice-voting-as-ballot-measure-2-passes-by-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election-reform ballot measure</a> in 2020, Alaska now uses a unique top-four primary system whereby all candidates (regardless of party) run on the same ballot and the top four finishers advance to the general election. (In a further twist, the general election will also use <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maine-is-trying-out-a-new-way-to-run-elections-but-will-it-survive-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are three front-runners who seem likely to make the cut. The first is a familiar name to not only Alaskans, but also most Americans: former Gov. Sarah Palin. It feels like a lifetime ago, but Palin was <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2008/sep/03/john-mccain/she-wins-popularity-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most popular governors in the country</a> when she was chosen as former Sen. John McCain’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election. But her rising star blinked out shortly after that: She came to be seen nationally as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2008/10/06/post-debate-palin-still-seen-as-unqualified-a-bump-for-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unqualified</a> for office, and in 2009 (after losing the vice presidency) she unexpectedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/us/politics/04palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned the governorship</a> (apparently because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/us/06palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethics investigations into her</a> were taking a financial and mental toll). For the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/sarah-palin-seriously-interested-in-2016-bid-114548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next several years</a>, there was <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/article/sarah-palins-arizona/2011/05/25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation</a> that she would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/07/sarah-palin-tea-party-speech1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run for office</a> again, but she never did — until this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These days, though, Palin is not popular in Alaska — according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148655178928128?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 6-9 poll</a> from Alaska Survey Research, 59 percent of likely special-election voters had a negative opinion of her, while just 36 percent had a positive one. But she still has a small, devoted fan base that gave her 19 percent of the primary vote in <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148572958035968?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that same poll</a>, more than any other candidate. And that fan base includes one very important non-Alaskan: former President Donald Trump, who has <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/04/04/trump-endorses-palin-in-bid-for-alaskas-sole-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed her</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, a Republican with more room to grow might be businessman Nick Begich III. In contrast with Palin — who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2016/01/13/a-peek-inside-sarah-palins-arizona-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought a house in Arizona</a> after her governorship — Begich’s Alaska ties are rock-solid: His grandfather was former Rep. Nick Begich Sr., whose <a href="https://www.planeandpilotmag.com/news/pilot-talk/2020/09/21/1972-cessna-310c-alaska-disappearance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disappearance in 1972</a> triggered the <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2019/03/06/don-young-46-years-in-an-office-he-never-expected-to-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special election</a> that brought Young to Congress. (The elder Begich was actually a Democrat, but the younger one says he’s a “<a href="https://www.alaskansfornickbegich.com/meet-nick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifelong Republican</a>.”) Begich has also raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK01083/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> (including $650,000 in self-funding) to Palin’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK00226/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$631,690</a>, and he enjoys the Alaska Republican Party’s <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/04/22/alaska-gop-endorse-begich-for-us-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement</a>. He snagged 16 percent in that Alaska Survey Research poll, too, which was good for second place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The third front-runner is fisherman-physician Al Gross, who is the only other candidate who has raised more than a quarter of a million dollars (he’s raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK01166/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$545,745</a>) and the only other candidate who registered in the double digits in the Alaska Survey Research poll (13 percent). Gross is a contender, in part, because he still has plenty of name recognition left over from his 2020 campaign for U.S. Senate, which could help him attract support from liberal (or at least not-conservative) Alaskans; though he is an independent, he ran in 2020 as the Democratic nominee.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Alaska’s old primary system, candidates could still run for — and win — a party’s nomination without being a member of that party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> However, this time around, Gross is <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/05/05/in-a-special-us-house-race-alaska-democrats-wonder-if-now-is-their-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the door open</a> to caucusing with either party if he wins, which has led to a <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/05/09/alaska-democrats-lash-out-at-us-house-candidate-al-gross-the-same-candidate-they-endorsed-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messy breakup</a> with the state’s actual Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That leaves a free-for-all for the fourth and final slot in the August general election. Financially, the best-positioned is former Assistant Secretary of the Interior Tara Sweeney, who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK01174/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$231,364</a> and has also benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/special-elections-outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=AK01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$434,652</a> in super PAC spending. Sweeney, who would be the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress, has <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2022/05/31/alaska-native-candidates-for-us-house-talk-land-into-trust-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pitched herself</a> as “a Ted Stevens and Don Young Republican” in reference to two long-serving former legislators who were more focused on constituent services and appropriations than conservative dogma.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Or — and I can’t believe this is actual, serious political analysis — name recognition could propel Santa Claus into the general election. Claus (<a href="https://www.santaclausforalaska.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a real person</a>) is a city councilor in North Pole (<a href="https://www.northpolealaska.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a real city</a>) and is essentially the Sen. Bernie Sanders of this race — a self-described “independent, progressive, democratic socialist.” Though he’s not accepting campaign contributions, 59 percent of likely voters could form an opinion of him in the Alaska Survey Research poll, more than any other candidate other than Palin, Begich and Gross. It was enough for him to place fourth in that poll, albeit within the margin of error.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also several candidates with more traditional resumes and points in their favor. Republican John Coghill, for instance, still has 52 percent name recognition (as measured by the share of likely voters who can form an opinion of him) from his days as state Senate majority leader. Meanwhile, Republican state Sen. Josh Revak, who used to work for Young, has been <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/04/13/revak-earns-endorsement-from-youngs-widow-in-alaskas-us-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed by his widow</a>. And Anchorage Assemblyman Christopher Constant, former state Rep. Mary Peltola (who would also be the first Alaska Native in Congress) and state Rep. Adam Wool all have the advantage of being <em>actual</em> Democrats; if they don’t go for Gross, Alaska’s Democratic voters have to vote for someone. The problem with all these candidates, though, is that they have all raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/AK/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very little money</a>, and none of them registered above 5 percent in the poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In all honesty, though, it may not matter much who snags the fourth slot. When it comes to the general election, the candidate with the fewest first-place votes will be eliminated and their support redistributed to the candidates their voters ranked second. So unless the complexion of the race changes drastically during the next two months, the fourth-place finisher on Saturday will probably be the first to be eliminated in August. After all, that’s what the Alaska Survey Research poll found, no matter whether <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148601575776256?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeney</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148611402985472?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constant</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148622186541057?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peltola</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148632450043904?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claus</a> was the fourth contender.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, in each scenario, it was Begich who emerged victorious after all the ranked-choice voting rounds were complete. This is certainly not guaranteed to be the case after two months’ of campaigning, but as a starting point, it makes sense: Among the three front-runners, Begich is the ideologically middle choice. If Palin is eliminated second, most of her support is likely to go to fellow Republican Begich, not Gross. And if Gross is eliminated second, most of his support is likely to go to Begich, not Palin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, the outcome of this special election is still far from certain, but it at least looks possible that this is one election where ranked-choice voting could make a material difference. Based on her high profile, Palin may well finish the primary in first place. Under the old system (and the one that most other states use), this would have made her the Republican nominee, and in a red state like Alaska, she likely would have won the general election against whoever Democrats nominated — despite her unpopularity. But the Alaska system prevents her from winning with just a plurality of the vote and ensures that the winner is someone who can (eventually) earn majority support. That probably won’t be Palin.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s 6:30 a.m. and your third alarm is blaring. Another 10 minutes and you’ll have to miss breakfast before going to work. You get up, brush your teeth, shower and start a pot of coffee while watching the morning news. After the station’s meteorologist tells you it’s sunny with a high of 70 degrees, a health reporter follows up with the COVID-19 forecast: red-alert level today, with a 75 percent chance of exposure in spaces with at least 50 people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You respond to the risk by taking a rapid test before leaving the house — snapping a picture of the negative result for your colleagues — and grabbing your N95 mask.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a hypothetical future, but one that a new team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working on. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics</a> got an initial $200 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan to recruit data scientists, epidemiologists and science communicators who will come up with forecasts for the public and promote data-based decision-making. CFA aims to operate “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/04/19/new-cdc-team-early-alert-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the National Weather Service, but for infectious diseases</a>,” said epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers, the new center’s associate director for science, in an April article in The Washington Post.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which would be great — except that the forecasts have less data to work with now than they’ve had in years. COVID-19 case data is less and less reliable thanks to rapid testing, for one. In addition, hospitalization data can lag behind trends in transmission and may become unavailable in the coming months. And new sources like wastewater surveillance aren’t yet ready to replace clinical data. Imagine producing a weather forecast without reliable temperature or humidity measurements.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two converging trends are causing case data to become less useful. First, more Americans are using at-home rapid tests, and second, fewer Americans are using lab-based PCR tests.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">About six times as many at-home tests as PCR tests are being taken in the U.S., according to Mara Aspinall, a diagnostic-testing expert and health-care industry consultant. Using data from test manufacturers and retailers, Aspinall has kept a close eye on test capacity in the U.S. throughout the pandemic, and at this time last year, Americans were taking considerably more PCR tests than at-home tests.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unlike PCR test results, which are automatically reported by the labs that process the tests, the vast majority of at-home test results are not reported to public-health authorities. In recent months, PCR tests have also become less available. States such as <a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/vermont/2022/06/04/vermont-covid-testing-state-stop-free-testing-program-june-25/7496151001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont</a> and <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/04/06/colorado-closing-covid-testing-sites-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado</a> are shutting down free public-testing sites and directing patients to at-home tests and private health-care providers instead — even as government <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/03/29/1089355997/free-covid-tests-and-treatments-no-longer-free-for-uninsured-as-funding-runs-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding to cover tests for uninsured people has run out</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The official numbers we hear about on a daily basis, in terms of official COVID-19 cases, is becoming an increased undercount of the true number of infections that are circulating,” said Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida College of Public Health.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This increasing undercount leads to more uncertainty in COVID-19 forecasting, said Marc Lipsitch, an infectious-disease expert at Harvard and the temporary director of science at CFA. As the quality of case data gets worse, “we’re more reliant on the delayed indicators, like hospitalizations and deaths,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">CFA scientists are currently focused on hospitalization data, which U.S. modelers find more reliable than case numbers: Lipsitch described it as the best source that is “routinely and uniformly reported.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hospital admissions — the number of COVID-19 patients newly admitted for treatment — can be particularly useful, said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas at Austin’s COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. This metric provides “a stabler signal” than case counts, even though it doesn’t typically show an increase until a week or two <em>after</em> a surge. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But when health agencies rely on hospitalization data as their main source for policy decisions, they “lose valuable time to prevent morbidity and mortality,” Salemi said. Essentially, by the time hospital admissions show a meaningful uptick, it’s already too late to prevent a surge that will cause more people to get seriously ill — and it will drive similar increases in long COVID that aren’t visible in hospitalization data at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lipsitch agreed that this delay is a problem. Hospitalization data reflects COVID-19 spread in the recent past; when using data about the past to identify trends in the present, “the present becomes more ambiguous, because the most timely signal was also the lowest quality.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, Salemi said, hospitalization metrics face a problem of geography. While people living in every U.S. county may get infected with SARS-CoV-2, not every county has a hospital. For example, Alachua County, Florida, has a major health-care system where Floridians from several smaller, nearby counties go for treatment. Most of the hospitalizations from this region show up in Alachua County, not in the surrounding areas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even the imperfect hospitalization data may not always be available. When the Biden administration ends the national public-health emergency for COVID-19, hospitals and local health departments <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2022/05/13/the-biden-administration-fights-to-make-its-covid-funds-last-00032279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may no longer be required to report their data</a> to federal agencies. The emergency declaration will <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/politics/covid-19-public-health-emergency/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue beyond at least July 15</a>, but it’s unclear how long the administration will keep extending it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if the data does become even less reliable, then what? CFA is looking into alternatives, and wastewater monitoring is a top priority. Our sewers can provide more timely data than hospitalizations, and less biased data than cases. But wastewater is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-national-fight-against-covid-19-isnt-ready-to-go-to-the-sewers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far from a national surveillance system</a>: COVID-19 levels aren’t being tracked in water systems for much of the country, it takes time and resources to set up this tracking, and health agencies aren’t yet sure how to use the data once they do have it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lipsitch also wants to find a way to pinpoint <em>who</em> in a community is infected, with data that’s individual-level, not population-level like wastewater. Ideally, he would like to see the CDC perform population surveys, sampling a representative subset of Americans to estimate who has COVID-19. Such surveys could contribute to precise estimates of how many people in a given state or county are currently infected, driving forecasts of an individual’s chance at exposure if they go to work or school. British modelers consider similar surveys <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/previousReleases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted by the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics</a> much more reliable than case counts, Lipsitch said. But there’s no comparison for these surveys in the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">CFA’s conversations about potential data sources and public-health actions are largely theoretical at this point, as the center is still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analysis/about/who-we-are.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a team of only four people</a> — three of whom are “on loan” from their academic positions, as Lipsitch described it. Posting job descriptions for the center’s eventual 100 scientists and communicators is “taking longer than we had hoped,” he said. As of early June, <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/job/655773600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only one job posting</a> is open for applications.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As it works on scaling up, CFA faces a broader challenge: the CDC’s lack of authority over state and local health agencies. “Outside of a public-health emergency, CDC has no authority to require states to share data,” Lipsitch said. And even during the COVID-19 emergency, the agency has been unable to require sharing some key metrics, such as <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakthrough cases and deaths</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The CDC also has limited authority over Americans overall, and trust in the public-health system is waning. One recent poll showed that nearly one-third of the country <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thinks the pandemic is already over</a>, while Congress consistently <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/congressional-stalemate-makes-a-quick-compromise-on-covid-funding-unlikely" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fails to deliver new funding</a> for COVID-safety measures. These may be concerning signals for the new forecasting center’s future: Even if the CFA is able to provide timely, accurate infectious-disease forecasts like what we have for the weather, how many people will actually act on the information?</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the end of the day on May 24, more than 400 children walked away from Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas as survivors. That single day of grade school will follow them for years, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-school-shootings-impact-survivors-in-the-long-term" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a formative trauma that increases their risks</a> of experiencing depression, missing school days and even earning less money over their lifetimes. Research shows that violence in the classroom harms kids regardless of whether it physically injures them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were also more than 50 million children enrolled at other K-12 schools in the United States that day. Whether they were across town or across the country, many of those children will also have memories of May 24, 2022; sirens, blaring news reports, or the hushed, tense whispers of adults. They know something awful happened to kids just like them. Next year, they’ll do active shooter drills in their own schools and remember that this will be real someday for someone, even if it’s never real for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Is that, also, a kind of trauma? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is precious little known about how the impacts of school shootings ripple out to children in the rest of the community, state and nation. But there’s plenty of research that suggests the trauma of violence in general probably doesn’t stop at the specific location where it happened. And that, experts told me, means we need to be thinking differently about the damage violence can cause and who is at risk. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the high-profile nature of school shootings, and mass shootings more broadly, the mental health impacts of these kinds of events have not been widely studied. Five years ago, Dr. Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health, co-published <a href="https://miningquiz.com/pdf/Mass_Shootings/The-Mental-Health-Consequences-of-Mass-Shootings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a review of research on how mass shootings impact mental health</a>. The 49 peer-reviewed papers he analyzed were mostly focused on what happened to direct survivors — people who were at the site of a mass shooting but left alive. There were only a few that addressed indirect exposure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These studies found evidence of trauma even for those who were not in the room or building where a mass shooting happened, though impacts were larger the closer people were to the actual incident. Other factors — such as media exposure, or the amount of time someone spent discussing the shooting with family and friends — also seemed to affect who came away with symptoms of trauma and how severe they were. But the amount of research on this subject was very small and incomplete, and it’s hard to say much with certainty. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And according to Gaelea that is still true today. “The issue of mental health in community members who are not directly affected… most people in the mental health space think it’s a real issue but there actually has been very little research on it,” he told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, there’s lots of evidence that, in certain situations, people can have their mental health impacted by traumatic events even if they weren’t personally in physical danger. “We’ve known for 20 years that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637659/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching media images of people suffering</a> can, in and of itself, be a trigger for common mood anxiety disorders, things like depression and post-traumatic stress,” Galea said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Evidence suggests there are multiple kinds of indirect trauma, said Jennifer Carlson, a professor of sociology, government and public policy at the University of Arizona. Vicarious trauma, she said, is what happens when people like <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10926771.2012.689422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social workers are deeply exposed to the trauma of their clients</a> and feel helpless to prevent those people from experiencing traumatic events. Community trauma, meanwhile, happens when whole populations are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nuf.12550" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collectively traumatized by something that affects everyone on a cultural level</a>, even if some individuals don’t experience it personally. The traumatic impact of the Holocaust on the Jewish community is a good example of this, as is the collective trauma expressed by Black Americans in the wake of the George Floyd murder. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This knowledge has implications for how we think about the trauma of school shootings, even if we don’t know exactly how school shootings are affecting the mental health of kids nationwide. People who aren’t affected physically by a disaster are often reminded that they have a low risk of experiencing something like that themselves. There are tens of millions of kids enrolled in school every year, but only <a href="https://www.chds.us/ssdb/charts-graphs/#victimsperyear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little over a hundred a year</a> — if that — become direct victims of a school shooting. The risk is low. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s the wrong way to think about risk when we know a traumatic event will happen. The number of school shootings every year that involve active shooters are very small — <a href="https://www.chds.us/ssdb/charts-graphs/#incedentsbyyear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">averaging 5 per year between 2021 and 2011</a>, according to the Naval Postgraduate School’s K-12 School Shooting Database. But you have to go back to 1981 to find a year without at least one. School shootings are almost guaranteed to happen every year — we just don’t know to whom, Carlson said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that means the risk of harm isn’t just about the physical likelihood of being shot, it’s also about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0320-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anticipating a trauma that will happen to someone</a> — maybe even you — and feeling powerless to stop it and at the mercy of chance. “I am a sociologist of crime,” Carlson said. “I’m very much on board with [the idea that] people overestimate their likelihood of victimization.” But this is different, she said. The likelihood of anticipatory trauma can be high even if the risk of injury and death is low. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given that, it’s useless to tell people not to be afraid of something like gun violence. It isn’t just about the personal risk of getting shot, Galea said. In 2016, he published an analysis that found <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27667339/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the chances of an American knowing a gun violence victim at some point</a> in their lifetime are nearly 100 percent. There’s a greater social burden than the statistics of direct risk can show. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are certain moments in congressional history that have lived on even longer than the octogenarians who stalk the halls of Capitol Hill. They are the scenes that feel torn from the pages of a political drama: Sen. Howard Baker Jr. repeatedly asking during the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/curious-history-what-did-president-know-and-when-did-he-know-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watergate hearings</a>, “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” Army lawyer Joseph Welch excoriating Sen. Joseph McCarthy with a rhetorical question during the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/investigations/mccarthy-hearings/have-you-no-sense-of-decency.htm#:~:text=Wisconsin%20Republican%20senator%20Joseph%20R,Department%20and%20other%20federal%20agencies." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Army-McCarthy hearings</a>: “Have you no sense of decency?” A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ZDQKq2F08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel of tobacco executives</a> testifying one by one before Congress, incredulously, that nicotine is not addictive. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under the right circumstances, a congressional hearing can be a satisfying resolution to a tense political conflict, one that allows society to move forward. Doesn’t that sound nice right about now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is hoping its hearings will be remembered in the same light. On Thursday, the committee will begin a run of public hearings to reveal what its investigation has uncovered and provide guidance on how to avoid a similar assault in the future. Rep. Jamie Raskin has promised the hearings will “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-revelations-will-blow-roof-house-rep-jamie-raskin-says-rcna25542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blow the roof off the House</a>,” and in a statement to FiveThirtyEight, Rep. Adam Schiff said, “I wouldn’t expect these hearings to look like a typical congressional hearing.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But surely both of these majority committee members know how difficult it will be to change the public’s mind about what happened on Jan. 6, 2021. Polling shows many Americans (especially Republicans) think <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-moving-on-from-jan-6-even-if-congress-hasnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too much attention</a> has been paid to the attacks and say they are ready to “move on.” Furthermore, people who participated in the riot or support the “Big Lie,” the baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen, have already secured nominations across the country in primary elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, what makes for a memorable hearing? Well, taking place in the ’70s and ’80s is one ingredient. That was the golden age of congressional hearings, when the country was less polarized and news consumption more homogeneous. But maybe there’s still something to learn from those hearings of yesteryear — they may offer some hints as to how the Jan. 6 committee can recapture the magic.</p>



<h2><strong>New information</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In July 1973, two months into the Senate Watergate hearings, a former White House assistant named Alexander Butterfield made a startling revelation: There were recording devices in the West Wing. This disclosure not only shocked the public but also marked the beginning of the end for then-President Richard Nixon’s administration. While reporting from The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein revealed many details of the Watergate scandal, it wasn’t until the hearings — where individuals with firsthand knowledge were obliged to testify — that Nixon’s involvement became undeniable. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Excavating new information is what hearings are designed to do, and it can make them more appealing to the public, and more likely to effect change, according to Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg" alt="Alexander Butterfield Testifying" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Alexander Butterfield, a former deputy assistant to President Richard Nixon, brought a blockbuster revelation to the Watergate Senate hearings in 1973. <p>Bettman / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In fact, we can see that impact in polling conducted before and during the Watergate hearings. At the start of these televised hearings in May 1973, the Watergate scandal had already knocked Nixon’s approval rating down 20 percentage points in four months to 48 percent, and by early August, it had dropped to 31 percent, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/25/how-the-watergate-crisis-eroded-public-support-for-richard-nixon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup polling cited by the Pew Research Center</a>. Likewise, prior to the hearings, 31 percent of Americans said they believed Watergate was a serious matter and not just politics, but by August, that number had climbed to a 53 percent majority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Committee members also elicit new information by asking fact-finding questions, not by using these public hearings simply as a stage from which to speechify. But this is Congress — speechifying is an inevitability. Especially these days. Ju Yeon Park, a political scientist at the University of Essex who studies the communication style of American legislators, has found that <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/709147?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grandstanding</a> — which she defines as using “hearings as opportunities to send political messages by taking positions on policy issues or framing the image of a party or the administration” — has grown more common in congressional hearings in recent years. She also has forthcoming research that shows more time spent grandstanding is correlated with better performance in the following election (which may, uh, help explain this behavior). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s tough to know, then, whether the Jan. 6 hearings will reveal new information or simply provide a platform for partisan grandstanding ahead of the midterms. There are still many unresolved questions about what happened in the days leading up to and on the day of the attack, and perhaps the hearings will be able to answer them.  </p>



<h2><strong>Insider witnesses</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another common component of history-making hearings is an insider witness. Congress has unique subpoena powers that can compel individuals to testify who may not otherwise have volunteered to do so. This has resulted in key moments like Butterfield’s revelation in 1973 or the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-09-mn-3189-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1987 testimony of former National Security aide Lt. Col. Oliver North</a>, when he took the fall for the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal during President Ronald Reagan’s administration. It has also facilitated moments when new information came to light and made for less partisan hearings, according to Jonathan Lewallen, a political scientist at the University of Tampa and the author of “Committees and the Decline of Lawmaking in Congress.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those witnesses can make a hearing feel like more than just one long session of ax grinding — and there’s been more of that lately, too. In recent years, Congress has held fewer hearings and is hearing from fewer witnesses, and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rego.12090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to research</a> from Lewallen published in 2015, those witnesses are presenting a narrower range of views. Lewallen and his colleagues found that, over the past 40 years, a greater share of congressional hearings are positional (essentially arguing only one side of an issue) rather than exploratory (when all sides of an issue are considered). In 1977-1978, only 19 percent of the hearings held were positional, but in 2007-2008, 30 percent were. Lewallen said that is due partly to having fewer witnesses and over-relying on government appointees, who are less likely to push against the party line.</p>

Republican figures who were heavily involved with then-President Donald Trump’s actions on the day of the Capitol attack have refused to testify to the committee, and as a result, at least two have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/politics/peter-navarro-contempt-jan-6.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/politics/peter-navarro-contempt-jan-6.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charged with contempt of Congress</a>. Former White House chief of staff <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jan-6-house-committee-meadows-trump/2021/12/14/ae2d10a8-5ce9-11ec-ae5b-5002292337c7_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Meadows</a>, Trump’s onetime lawyer <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-new-york-mayor-giuliani-refuses-testify-before-us-capitol-riot-panel-2022-05-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rudy Giuliani</a>, former White House chief strategist <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-subpoena-capitol-attack-trump-1638839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Bannon</a> and a handful of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/gop-lawmakers-testimony-capitol-riot-00029322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP members of Congress</a> have all refused to testify. In May, the committee took the unprecedented step of actually <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/12/1098509467/mccarthy-jan-6-panel-subpoena-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpoenaing their Republican colleagues</a> to testify. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The committee has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/10/politics/list-january-6-subpoenas/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpoenaed dozens of witnesses</a>, many of whom were either involved in planning the Trump rally that preceded the attack or helped him with his baseless campaign to overturn the 2020 election results, which fueled the attack. So, even if big names aren’t cooperating, we may hear some illuminating testimony. The committee also benefits from the mountain of media created on the day of the attack, including videos and photos from the attackers themselves. In his statement, Schiff said the committee “will present the evidence we have gathered through both live testimony and a variety of media, so as to be both highly engaging and deeply informative.”</p>



<h2><strong>Bipartisanship</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">That moment when Butterfield acknowledged the existence of recording devices in the West Wing was not only a revelation for the American public but also a carefully orchestrated moment of bipartisanship. Butterfield had already <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3447219&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the taping system</a> in a closed-door interview with committee staff three days before his public testimony. Since a Republican lawyer had asked the question that elicited Butterfield’s admission in the background interview, the committee agreed it was only fair to let a Republican ask the question on the public record, and so it was decided that the committee’s minority counsel, Fred Thompson (who was later elected to the Senate, in 1994) would be the one to do so. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bipartisanship also played a key role in many famous hearings in U.S. history, according to Troy. “In the Army-McCarthy hearings, Eisenhower was working behind the scenes to try to make McCarthy look bad. So the Republicans were working with the Democrats to make it come out in a certain way. Obviously in the Watergate hearings, the Republicans were brought in for the big questions,” Troy said. “Cooperation brings better results — and results that the American people can embrace.”</p>

One example, he noted, was a <a href="https://www.levin-center.org/congress-investigates-kkk-violence-during-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional hearing after the Civil War</a> to investigate an emerging terrorist organization in the South: the Ku Klux Klan. While the hearings themselves were bipartisan, the Democrats rejected the findings laid out in the majority report and issued a minority report refuting all the facts found in the hearings, Townsend said. As a result, the hearings weren’t able to sway many minds.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Democrats constructed an alternative narrative. I mean, frankly, their own alternative facts that denied the existence of the KKK and put the blame on Northern so-called agitators and African Americans,” Townsend said. “We’ve been here before: an incredibly divided country where basic facts about whether terrorism, violent aggression against some people in our country was being explained in two very different ways.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well documented</a> at this point that American politics have become increasingly polarized over the past few decades. This affects not only how <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American voters view one another</a> but also how much they trust elected officials who don’t belong to the political party they identify with. When asked whether each major political party could be described “very” or “somewhat” well as “govern[ing] in an honest and ethical way,” Americans rarely agreed when it came to the opposing party, according to a January <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-the-republican-and-democratic-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Pew</a>. Just 17 percent of Democrats said the Republican Party governed honestly and ethically, and 13 percent of Republicans said the same about the Democratic Party. Trust in the government overall has been <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declining for decades</a> as well, and partisans typically trust the government less when the opposing party is in power, according to Pew. And while Americans’ positive feelings toward their own party have remained steady since the ’70s, their <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/for-2015-0030/html?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive feelings about the opposing party have been falling</a> — the gulf is only getting wider. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Positive feelings toward the other party have dropped sharply" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oTkZB/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">All of these findings underscore the importance of bipartisanship when trying to convene an effective hearing. To persuade partisans to pay attention and care about the information being presented, it has to come from their side of the aisle. “If one side — Republicans — are saying this is a partisan sideshow, then Republicans in the electorate are going to say this is a partisan sideshow,” said Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has been tracking the increasingly chilly feelings between partisans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this respect, the Jan. 6 hearings may have already failed before they’ve even begun. Although the committee is technically bipartisan, a majority of the members are Democrats. And including Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger — two of the 10 Republicans <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/14/956621191/these-are-the-10-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who voted to impeach</a> Trump after Jan. 6 — hasn’t inspired a ton of faith among Republicans: In a March 31-April 4 <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Navigator-Toplines-04.05.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from Global Strategy Group/GBAO</a>, 60 percent of Republicans said they agreed with a statement calling the Jan. 6 committee’s investigation “a partisan witch hunt.” Not to mention that Republicans in Congress have opposed the committee from the very beginning: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had GOP members <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000524897/senate-republicans-block-plan-for-independent-commission-on-jan-6-capitol-riot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block an independent commission</a> to investigate the attack. Then, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pelosi-mccarthy-jan6-committee/2021/07/21/21722d44-ea41-11eb-84a2-d93bc0b50294_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked two Republicans</a> from joining the commission, McCarthy <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mccarthys-jan-6-committee-gamble-faces-big-test-spring-rcna23681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had fellow Republicans boycott the commission</a> and what little good will was left likely evaporated. The upcoming hearings will likely elicit a similar response. In April, McCarthy told NBC: “This is nothing but a political show.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There have already been <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/query/0484b316-f676-44bc-97ed-ecefeabae077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">248 mass shootings this year</a>,<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of June 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> according to the Gun Violence Archive. At this point in 2021, there had been 258 mass shootings; in 2020, 173. Mass shootings are defined by the Gun Violence Archive as incidents in which at least four people — not including the shooter — are injured or killed, and they have been on the rise in recent years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It is often a select few mass shootings, though, that capture national headlines and spark outrage. Public opinion often shifts <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/support-for-gun-control-will-likely-rise-after-uvalde-but-history-suggests-it-will-fade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in favor of stricter gun laws</a> after high-profile mass shootings, like the one on May 14 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/14/nyregion/buffalo-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed 10 people in a racist attack</a> in Buffalo, New York, and the one on May 24 that killed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/victims-texas-school-shooting-uvalde/story?id=84948395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 children and two teachers</a> at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It should be no surprise, then, that the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a>, which was conducted from May 26 to June 6 and went into the field two days after the shooting in Uvalde, found that concerns regarding gun violence had surged. Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we interviewed the same 2,000 or so Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-2000-americans-about-their-biggest-concern-the-resounding-answer-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from our previous survey</a>, and of the 1,691 adults who responded, 42 percent named “crime or gun violence” as one of the most important issues facing the country, up 19 percentage points from the first wave of the poll released in early May.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.9 percentage points. As was the case in the first wave of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> This was by far the largest increase for any one issue we asked about, putting it behind only “inflation or increasing costs” as Americans’ top concern for the country.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="More Americans are concerned about gun violence" aria-label="Range Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2sVNi/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="593" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">How concerned Americans were about crime and/or gun violence did vary quite a bit by party, though, as Democrats and independents drove much of the shift. A solid majority of Democrats, 58 percent, named the issue as a top concern, up from 33 percent in early May, while 41 percent of independents said the same, up from 19 percent.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independents included respondents who identified as “independent” or “something else,” or who skipped the question for party identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> Republicans also became more worried about crime and/or gun violence, but the uptick was much smaller, going from 19 percent in May to 29 percent now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also found a sizable jump in the share of Black and Hispanic Americans who named crime and/or gun violence as one of the biggest issues for the country, which helps explain, in part, the higher degree of concern among Democrats, as Democrats <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/pp_2020-06-02_party-id_2-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more racially and ethnically diverse</a> than Republicans. The share of Hispanic Americans who cited the issue more than doubled, growing from 23 percent in May to 61 percent. To a lesser but still significant extent, the share of Black Americans who named gun violence or crime as a top issue also jumped, going from 35 percent in early May to 55 percent in our latest survey. White Americans were also more likely to be worried, but their overall level of concern was comparably lower: Thirty-five percent named the issue as a top worry, up from 19 percent a month ago.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of this dramatic shift can be explained by the sheer amount of media attention gun violence received in the days following the shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde. In fact, three-fourths of respondents reported having heard “a lot” about crime and/or gun violence in the news, more attention than any other issue we asked about received — even inflation (which around two-thirds said they had heard a lot about).<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked whether they had seen a lot of coverage of the 20 major issues we asked about in the past month, including “other” and “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, as we said at the outset, this is often what happens in the wake of a high-profile mass shooting. As a result of heightened media coverage, there is an uptick in concern about gun violence and/or a lot more support for stricter gun laws. However, the spotlight tends to fade over time and shift to other issues, so Americans become less engaged with the issue and support for stricter gun laws reverts to where it once stood. We didn’t ask about support for stricter gun laws in this poll, but we do know that more Americans are worried about gun violence. Even before this survey, it was one of Americans’ top three issues, so we plan to follow up soon with a deeper dive to better understand what’s driving Americans’ concerns around gun violence and/or crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nothing changed quite as much as Americans’ concern around crime and/or gun violence in our poll, but there were a handful of other important changes regarding which issues Americans felt were most pressing for the country. Abortion, for instance, saw the second-largest change on net, likely thanks to increased media coverage of the issue in early May following <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion</a> that suggests the court might be ready to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973. Nine percent of respondents in our survey named it as a top issue, up from just 4 percent a month ago. That said, abortion isn’t the issue that Americans in our poll are most worried about.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather, that distinction still belongs to inflation. Americans are most worried about inflation, with even more respondents (56 percent) naming it as a concern than in our last survey (52 percent). This was in large part driven by Republicans, as 75 percent cited inflation as a major concern, up from 65 percent a month ago. Independents were also somewhat more likely to name it as a concern, 56 percent now versus 50 percent in May. Roughly 40 percent of Democrats named inflation as a concern, but this barely changed from our previous survey.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, political extremism and polarization remained a top issue overall, ranking third behind inflation and crime/gun violence after ranking second in our last survey. We dug more into this issue, too, and Americans' attitudes around political extremism and polarization in this survey, so we’ll examine those results more in-depth in an article early next week. But as we’ve outlined here, there’s no question that the big, topline finding in our second FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll is that more Americans are concerned about crime and/or gun violence — at least for now.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, seven states held primary contests — California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew breaks down what the results in those states mean. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, more moderate candidates were able to win against challengers from the right (Republicans) and left (Democrats), although there was a sizable protest vote in some instances. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Contests in California served as a test of the strength of progressive appeals in a very blue state’s big cities. Progressive San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin was recalled in a landslide, and former Republican Rick Caruso advanced to the Los Angeles mayoral general election alongside Democratic Rep. Karen Bass. There were a couple surprises throughout the night, notably in Iowa, where once-rising Democratic star Abby Finkenauer lost the Senate primary to Mike Franken. The question, of course, remains whether a Democrat has any chance of winning a statewide election in a state that has swung decisively to the right.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Before 2018, most women in the Republic of Ireland were able to get abortions only if they traveled to a clinic in England or Wales or had a <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2020/04/01/self-managed-abortion-is-medically-very-safe-but-is-it-legally-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-managed</a> abortion at home, but figuring out how to do either of those options was difficult.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Information on abortion was censored in the first years of the ban, which took effect in 1983<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion was first banned in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1861 by the &lt;a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1861/act/100/enacted/en/print.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Offences Against the Person Act. The law&lt;/a&gt; stayed in place after Irish independence in 1922 but was effectively reinforced in a referendum in 1983, when anti-abortion activists backed by the Catholic Church thought Ireland would follow other Western democracies in loosening abortion restrictions and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-irelands-history-with-abortion-might-teach-us-about-a-post-roe-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;launched a campaign to preserve the ban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a>. Certain books were <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/publications-on-abortion-coming-off-banned-books-list-1.3960794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prohibited</a>, and even the Irish edition of Cosmopolitan magazine had <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-03-11-mn-218-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blank pages instead of adverts</a> for British clinics. Meanwhile, those who sought abortions faced isolation, stigma and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6237647/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited help from medical professionals</a>. And for the few who were able to overcome those barriers and somehow reach one of the feminist networks that could help with information, logistics and fundraising, they still might <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/abortion-ireland-northern-ireland-women-travel-england-amelia-gentleman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay hundreds of pounds or more</a> for the procedure, transportation, meals and a hotel. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fiona de Londras, the chair of global legal studies at the University of Birmingham in the U.K., told me that Irish officials would question women on ferries and in airports “if they looked young and kind of pregnant-y.” If you were pregnant in Ireland, you <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/eighth-amendment-casts-shadow-over-care-for-pregnant-women-1.3454604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might not have access to medical care</a> that could potentially affect the fetus, even for something like cancer, de Londras said. “The only thing the woman [was] entitled to from the state is that she’s not dead at the end of the pregnancy,” she said. “Apart from that, the state’s obligation was to the fetus.”</p>

Though the U.K.’s 1967 Abortion Act established the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks into pregnancy, and later than that in certain circumstances, the devolved government of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-56041849" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Northern Ireland did not pass the legislation&lt;/a&gt;, and by law, anyone obtaining an abortion could be subject to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/15/abortion-law-harsher-northern-ireland-alabama-campaigners" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;life in prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> From 1983 to 2018, “the right to life of the unborn” was <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-referendum-1983-what-happened-1225430-Dec2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equal to the “right to life of the mother</a>,” and the state was empowered to “defend and vindicate that right.” This was enshrined in the Irish Constitution’s Eighth Amendment, which two-thirds of voters approved in a 1983 referendum. Furthermore, under Irish law, performing or obtaining an abortion was punishable by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43961988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 14 years</a> in prison. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this didn’t stop abortions in Ireland. Abortions happened anyway, both abroad and underground. But the fact that they still happened — and that they were still in demand — didn’t make the effort to legalize them any easier. It took another 35 years for abortion to become legal in Ireland — and a steady stream of activism and high-profile stories of suffering for abortion rights to expand. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What happened there is an extreme example of the effects of outlawing abortion. The circumstances around abortion rights in the U.S. are different in crucial ways, yet Ireland’s story is instructive because it offers clues as to what could be in store here. And it raises a question that plagued Irish abortion-rights activists for years: What will it take for people to change their minds?</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Before <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Samuel Alito’s majority draft opinion</a> in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked in May, most Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-the-first-time-in-years-democrats-are-more-concerned-about-abortion-than-republicans-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t think Roe v. Wade would likely be overturned</a>. The nearly 50-year-old legal precedent that established the constitutional right to abortion had created a kind of complacency in the status quo that meant most Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, didn’t think Roe was at serious risk of not being the law of the land anymore. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polling on abortion</a> is complicated, but it does show that most Americans don’t want to spend much time thinking about it. Moreover, they don’t actually know a lot about abortion — or, for that matter, pregnancy. Most Americans tend to think both the left and the right are extreme on the issue, and so they avoid the debate altogether. And while it’s true that most Americans don’t think Roe should be overturned, they also don’t know exactly what Roe allows, which means they sometimes support restrictions that conflict with it. Many Americans also don’t know what will happen in their states if Roe is overturned. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This general lack of knowledge existed in Ireland before the <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-referendum-1983-what-happened-1225430-Dec2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referendum establishing fetal personhood was passed</a>, as abortion hadn’t been legal or commonly acknowledged. What’s different in the United States, of course, is that the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to take away a right that has already existed for many women. But the example of Ireland shows that Americans still may not know the full consequences of denying pregnant people access to those rights, including their own rights to a healthy life.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It took almost a decade for the broader Irish public to become aware of the dire consequences faced by those who are denied abortions. In 1991, <a href="https://www.irishlegal.com/articles/irish-legal-heritage-the-introduction-of-internment-in-ireland-for-14-year-old-girls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 14-year-old girl was raped</a> by the father of one of her friends. The attorney general filed an injunction prohibiting her and her parents from traveling to England to seek an abortion because the law compelled the state to protect the life of the fetus. During that time, the girl was expressing suicidal thoughts, and a clinical psychologist testified in a court hearing that the girl was at risk of killing herself; ultimately, the Irish Supreme Court decided to set aside the initial court ruling, thus allowing the girl to get an abortion because <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43962738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there was a real threat of suicide</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The girl’s case <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/twenty-years-on-a-timeline-of-the-x-case-347359-Feb2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparked widespread protests</a> both for and against abortion rights, but in the end, de Londras said, “It was maybe the first time society as a whole understood the extent of the restriction the Eighth Amendment actually created in Irish law.” As a result of the case, referendums in 1992 established that Irish citizens couldn’t be prevented from traveling abroad for a legal abortion or from learning about abortion services in other countries.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another turning point was in 2012, when 31-year-old dentist <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/roe-wade-savita-halappanavar-abortion-pregnancy-case-ireland-1702913" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Savita Halappanavar</a> started to have a miscarriage at a hospital but was denied an abortion because a fetal heartbeat could still be detected. Despite her pleas for treatment over the course of several days, she developed sepsis, experienced multiple organ failure and died of cardiac arrest. The doctors almost certainly misunderstood the law, but Halappanavar’s death gave more women in Ireland space to talk about pregnancy care and abortions, and movements started for women to share their stories anonymously. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-156387492-711.jpg" alt="Pro-choice supporters at a vigil for Savita Halappanavar" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-156387492-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-156387492-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-156387492-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Savita Halappanavar’s death in 2012 was a turning point for abortion rights in Ireland. <p>PETER MUHLY / AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Fiona Bloomer, a senior lecturer in social policy at Ulster University in Belfast, who has conducted many surveys, focus groups and lectures on abortion, estimates that around this time, in the final years of the Eighth Amendment, only about 10 percent of the population was strongly against abortion. “The anti-abortion voices dominated, and they were loud and strong and hostile. It created an environment where people didn’t want to talk about abortion,” she said. That began to change, though, in the aftermath of Halappanavar’s death, and it became clear that most people wanted reform. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, it simply got easier for women to have a self-managed abortion at home. In 1988,  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/24/us/france-and-china-allow-sale-of-a-drug-for-early-abortion.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France and China</a> approved the use of mifepristone<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medication then known as RU-486.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a>to induce abortions early in pregnancy, in combination with a prostaglandin such as misoprostol; <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2002/05/mifepristone-early-medical-abortion-experiences-france-great-britain-and#:~:text=Registered%20regimens%20largely%20reflect%20the,regimens%20for%20early%20medical%20abortion." target="_blank" rel="noopener">other European countries</a> soon followed suit. With the rise of the Internet and the growing availability of these medications — they could be sent through the mail after an online consultation — the use of this regimen grew over the following years. (It wasn’t illegal to obtain the medications in Ireland, only to use them.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2005, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts founded <a href="https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/521/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women on Web</a>, a nonprofit group that offers consultations to anyone in the world seeking an abortion who cannot get one legally or safely and provides the medications they need to self-manage an abortion at home. <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.14401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studies showed</a> that women in Ireland began using Women on Web and similar services and were happy and relieved to be able to end their pregnancies without having to travel abroad. They would also recommend these services to friends. The increase in medication abortions highlighted how simple and safe abortions could be. When the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment passed in 2018, it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45568094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got 66.4 percent of the vote</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Is the U.S. now headed down the same path as Ireland once was? The laws poised to go into effect in many states if Roe is overturned are extreme and unpopular. Thirteen states <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-bans-restrictons-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would ban abortions outright</a> either immediately or within weeks, although all 13 states make some sort of exception for the life and health of the mother. Many do not make exceptions in cases of rape or incest, however, according to an analysis from The New York Times. And the Center for Reproductive Rights found that overturning or weakening Roe would <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/what-if-roe-fell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectively ban abortion in 24 states and three U.S. territories</a>, even if local laws don’t ban it explicitly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, not only do women already have trouble accessing safe abortions when restrictions are in place, but reproductive health care is affected in other ways. For instance, data shows that in the U.S., being pregnant and giving birth is more dangerous than getting an abortion, which means that if Roe is overturned, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/overturning-roe-v-wade-could-make-maternal-mortality-even-worse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal mortality rates are likely to get worse</a> — and many of these deaths would be entirely preventable. Being denied an abortion can also have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/05/15/1098347992/a-landmark-study-tracks-the-lasting-effect-of-having-an-abortion-or-being-denied" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lasting mental-health effects</a>. If Ireland is any example, a lot more women in America will have to die or experience mental-health issues before attitudes toward abortion care dramatically shift.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240664864-711.jpg" alt="Pro-choice supporters at a rally in Texas" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240664864-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240664864-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240664864-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>After the U.S. Supreme Court refused to stop Texas’s six-week abortion ban from taking effect and the court’s majority draft opinion that would overturn Roe was leaked, more Americans started supporting abortion rights. <p>Montinique Monroe / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">There are signs that attitudes in the U.S. are already changing, however. Tresa Undem, a public-opinion researcher who co-founded the nonpartisan polling firm PerryUndem, said that since a <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/08/impact-texas-abortion-ban-14-fold-increase-driving-distance-get-abortion?gclid=CjwKCAjwyryUBhBSEiwAGN5OCLgt-d0iERbFMUFekujipB89tnrwQiltGruMb9nvV2Zqm7itIGAUqBoCpMgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban on abortions after six weeks</a> went into effect in Texas, more Texans are aware of anti-abortion laws; in addition, Undem told me, men and independent women voters were talking and thinking about the issue more than they had previously. “For the first time since I’ve been doing research, I heard them really take this issue extremely personally and change their behavior.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Undem said that sustained news coverage penetrating into local news may be making people more aware of the consequences of Roe being overturned, and this in turn may be making them become more engaged on the issue. For example, a Gallup poll conducted between May 2 and May 22 found that the share of Americans identifying as pro-choice <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped 6 percentage points, to 55 percent</a>, since May 2021. Much of that shift was driven by more Democrats and Democratic-leaning groups like younger adults and women identifying as such; nevertheless, more Americans than not said they wanted abortion to be legal in all or most circumstances.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the realities of pre-Roe life are in the distant past for most Americans. “People just don’t believe [the worst stories],” said Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law. “And if they do believe that, they don’t get what it’s going to be like, because they’ve never lived through it.” The stories that really change people’s minds are often extreme, she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider the stories that ultimately sparked change in Ireland, and how long it took for that change to happen. In reality, many women in the U.S. are already living under similar conditions to those in Ireland before the Eighth Amendment was overturned. But because these stories mostly involve women who are already marginalized — women of color, poor women, undocumented women and women in Southern states — much of the country has not been motivated so far to act to change those conditions. “It’s Black and brown women who are dying now,” said Michele Goodwin, a professor at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. Americans are inured to Black women’s suffering and death, she said. “We shouldn’t have to look any further than the maternal mortality rates in this country to say, ‘Let’s just stay out of women’s reproductive health.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But so far, that hasn’t happened. In fact, it seems likely that red and red-leaning states will continue to pass restrictive laws whether or not Roe is overturned, while abortion-rights activists will try to help women overcome them. Activists in blue states haven’t been working to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-rights-havent-been-a-priority-in-blue-states-until-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ensure abortion rights in their own states</a> until very recently, and that is in part because the unusual legal system in the U.S. makes federal actions to expand rights much more difficult to implement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible, though, that movements for expanding abortion rights worldwide will offer insight into what’s possible for the U.S. After all, abortion rights have expanded in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45568094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/21/abortion-to-be-decriminalised-in-northern-ireland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47890065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Korea</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/world/asia/thailand-abortion-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034925270/mexico-abortion-decriminalized-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/21/1082236222/colombias-highest-court-legalizes-abortion-up-to-24-weeks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colombia</a> and other countries around the globe recently, and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1096840071/striking-down-roe-v-wade-will-hit-people-of-color-hardest-activists-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reproductive-justice movement</a> has also been taken up again in many states. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, the movement to restrict abortion rights, now arguably at the height of its success, might be what ultimately prevails in the U.S. Even though these views are held only by a small minority of the public, the anti-abortion movement has worked relentlessly to overcome the structural barriers in the political system for some 50 years, and they’re potentially on the cusp of their biggest victory yet. “The way they’ve chipped away at the meaningful right to access abortion, the way they’ve captured Supreme Court nominee processes … that level of organization and commitment, that’s what works in a fragmented setting like this,” de Londras said. “Even if one says so with grudging admiration, what they’ve done is very extraordinary.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Politics in Los Angeles are as complicated and knotty as its highway system. L.A. has so much inequality over so much space that its residents often want wildly different things from their politicians — even if nearly all of those politicians are Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The city’s open-seat mayoral election — whose first round<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field will winnow to two candidates as long as no candidate gets above 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> takes place on Tuesday — reflects that paradox, with a pileup of Democrats pitching solutions to a city of 3.9 million residents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two of the 12 candidates on the ballot are clear front-runners: Rep. Karen Bass and billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso have made public safety and cost of living central issues in their campaigns, but they have dramatically different visions of what a safer, more affordable L.A. should look like. Bass, who led the state Assembly before serving a decade in the U.S. House of Representatives, is the more progressive of the two. The former chair of the Black Congressional Caucus has leaned into her background as a community organizer in the city, highlighting her “<a href="https://twitter.com/KarenBassLA/status/1531689578830385153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crisis-tested</a>” skill set that would help her address homelessness as a pressing economic and public health crisis. Caruso, meanwhile, is a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/meet-kim-kardashian-gwyneth-paltrow-and-snoop-doggs-candidate-for-mayor-of-l-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Republican</a> who has blanketed the airwaves with <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-22/how-bad-is-crime-in-l-a-here-are-the-numbers-behind-the-mayoral-race-rhetoric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dire depictions</a> of the city’s uptick in crime, promising to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSa47i5fJtU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clean up</a>” the streets and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qs13uh9Xbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire 1,500 more police officers</a>. His <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-07/caruso-has-now-loaned-his-campaign-10-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big spending</a> has helped him clear the field; in recent weeks, other candidates who sought to position themselves in the moderate lane have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-23/ramit-varma-drops-out-of-mayoral-race-endorses-rick-caruso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> and <a href="https://abc7.com/buscaino-caruso-mayor-campaign/11841436/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> him. L.A. Councilman Kevin de León — the only major Latino candidate in a city that is <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/losangelescitycalifornia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost half Latino</a> — is also running but has lagged behind Bass and Caruso in polls. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This election poses a problem for us incorrigible election-watchers: The major candidates are all Democrats, and Los Angeles is an almost uniformly Democratic city. So, to make sense of the city’s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2021-12-01/la-voters-are-frustrated-impatient-over-persistent-homelessness-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political fissures</a> (and there certainly <a href="https://usceconreview.com/2019/04/03/the-negative-implications-of-los-angeles-increasing-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are plenty</a>), we needed something more sophisticated. When we ran into the same problem sizing up the mayoral election in deep-blue New York City last year, we tried to show that its politics were far more complex than just “solidly Democratic” by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-5-political-boroughs-of-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dividing the city into five “political boroughs”</a> based on the results of recent Democratic primaries. It’s only fair, then, that we give L.A. the same treatment on the occasion of its own big municipal election. (Let no one accuse FiveThirtyEight of East Coast bias!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve carved up Los Angeles into six political regions based on the <a href="https://www.lavote.gov/home/voting-elections/current-elections/election-results/past-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results</a><a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used “ballot groups” — essentially, clusters of precincts that all fall within the same political jurisdictions — as the building blocks for our regions. However, we omitted ballot groups with fewer than 100 ballots cast in the presidential race due to lack of data. You can find which ballot groups are in which region in the footnotes, although note that ballot groups change with every election. The ballot groups referenced in this article are for the 2020 general election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> of seven elections on the November 2020 ballot: the presidential race, the district attorney’s race and five high-profile local ballot measures.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Together, these elections encapsulate several modern political cleavages: </p>



<ul><li>The contest between then-President Donald Trump and now-President Joe Biden gets at the traditional red-blue divide.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-06/george-gascon-la-district-attorney-race-jackie-lacey-concede">district attorney’s race</a> shows support for a centrist Democrat (incumbent Jackie Lacey) versus a progressive criminal-justice reformer (George Gascón). </li><li><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/uber-lyft-doordash-fight-california-labor-law-ab5">Proposition 22</a>, which sought to guarantee modest benefits to gig workers (e.g., Uber and Lyft drivers) in exchange for classifying them as independent contractors (and thus ineligible for fuller benefits), reveals Angelenos’ feelings on business and labor. </li><li><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Los_Angeles_County,_California,_Measure_J,_Budget_Allocation_for_Alternatives_to_Incarceration_Charter_Amendment_(November_2020)">Measure J</a>, which sought to invest more money in communities of color to discourage incarceration, and <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Proposition-15-explained-california-property-tax-15641203.php">Proposition 15</a>, which would have effectively raised taxes on many commercial properties by taxing them at market value instead of purchase price, gauge how much residents want to redistribute wealth in their city. </li><li>Measure J and <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article246400055.html">Proposition 16</a>, which aimed to overturn the state’s ban on affirmative action, get at attitudes on racial justice.</li><li><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Proposition-21-explained-rent-control-Newsom-Prop-15670347.php">Proposition 21</a>, which tried to expand rent control, helps us see where city residents stand on the <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/2021/12/california-housing-crisis-both-wide-and-deep/">hot-button issue</a> of housing.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">With the mayoral race playing out along many of these same lines, we hope our six “political neighborhoods” will be useful for interpreting the results as they come in on Tuesday night (and, because California votes by mail, in the days after). But even if you don’t care about who leads Los Angeles, these regions also highlight broader truths common to many American cities: People of color are strong Democrats but aren’t necessarily strong liberals; trendy white neighborhoods have some of the most progressive politics in the city; Latinos can’t be pegged to a single political identity; and even in dark-blue cities, you can still find support for conservative candidates and causes.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">None of these results is surprising when you consider that South Central residents are almost all people of color: 68 percent of the voting-age population here is Hispanic, while 22 percent are Black; by contrast, only 5 percent of the voting-age population in this political neighborhood is white.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For concision throughout this article, we use the terms “white,” “Black” and “Asian American” to refer to people of one race who are non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic Asian American, respectively. The Hispanic population can be of any race. All demographic data is from the 2020 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although Black residents are not the majority in this region, predominantly Black areas do set the tone for some of its politics: Biden’s, Measure J’s and Proposition 16’s best showings in South Central came in majority-Black ballot groups like those in Hyde Park. Yet the neighborhood’s strong support for Proposition 15 was driven mostly by heavily Hispanic areas. While support for raising taxes on commercial properties reached as high as 70 percent in Hispanic ballot groups, it was closer to 60 percent in Black ones.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">South Central may be strongly Democratic and liberal on certain issues, but it’s not necessarily a progressive stronghold. With <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-02/in-south-l-a-police-join-community-leaders-to-denounce-gun-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high crime rates</a> being a perennial problem in this neighborhood, a significant number of voters here supported Lacey and her <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-31/jackie-lacey-george-gascon-everything-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more punitive approach</a> to preventing crime. (She also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-01/jackie-lacey-grew-up-in-south-l-a-but-in-a-tough-d-a-s-race-her-opponents-are-encroaching-on-her-home-turf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grew up in the neighborhood</a>.) South Central supported Gascón for district attorney with only 57 percent of the vote, below his citywide haul of 59 percent. And despite Proposition 22’s cap on gig workers’ benefits, residents of this working-class neighborhood may have been convinced by Uber and Lyft’s argument that <a href="https://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/2020/10/30/gig-companies-threatening-eliminate-thousands-jobs-if-prop-22-doesnt-pass/6072162002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobs would be cut</a> if the measure failed. Proposition 22 passed here 55 percent to 45 percent, making South Central its second-best neighborhood.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It will be interesting to see who wins out here in the mayor’s race. As a Black Democrat who represents part of the neighborhood in Congress, Bass seems a good fit on paper. But Caruso’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/rick-caruso-los-angeles-mayor-candidate-reactionary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more populist tendencies</a> — such as talking tough on crime — could appeal to South Central too.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This is indisputably L.A.’s most progressive region. It was the strongest of our six neighborhoods for Gascón as well as for all the further-left positions on the local ballot measures. Most notably, it was the only neighborhood to break strongly with Big Tech on Proposition 22, voting against it 59 percent to 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Taken as a whole, the True-Blue Progressives neighborhood is racially and ethnically mixed; Latinos are the biggest demographic group, but they make up only 38 percent of the area’s voting-age population. However, the white voting-age population is larger than the citywide average. Interestingly, there aren’t significant differences in how the plurality-Hispanic and plurality-white parts of this neighborhood vote; both are dyed-in-the-wool progressive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the mayoral race, it would be a big surprise if Bass didn’t crush Caruso here. But de León could post good numbers here too, considering that he represents parts of Northeast L.A. on the <a href="https://councildistrict14.com/our-neighborhoods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">city council</a>. He hasn’t fully embraced progressivism in his <a href="https://www.kevindeleon.com/public-safety-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mayoral campaign</a>, but he did run for U.S. Senate in 2018 as a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-usc-latimes-poll-senate-20181018-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal alternative</a> to Sen.

<p data-paragraph="main">With a demographic composition that’s similar to the city’s as a whole, the population of this area is diverse, and most of its voting population is liberal. It was Biden’s, Gascón’s, Measure J’s, Proposition 15’s and Proposition 21’s second-best political neighborhood. But where it differs from the True-Blue Progressives is its vote on Proposition 22: Fair-Weather Progressives voted to give gig workers the benefits of full employment by a tighter margin of 52 percent to 48 percent. On the spectrum of progressivism, then, this neighborhood falls somewhere between True-Blue Progressives and South Central.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Predominantly white ballot groups like those covering Sawtelle and ballot groups with significant Asian American populations like those in Koreatown were less supportive of Biden than the neighborhood’s Hispanic sectors. Those white ballot groups were also more skeptical of affirmative action and expanded rent control.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Expect the Fair-Weather Progressives to support Bass for mayor; her orientation as more-progressive-than-Caruso-but-not-capital-P-progressive seems to be a perfect fit for voters here. But de León will be counting on a strong showing here too, especially in Downtown and Eastside L.A., which are also largely in his city council district.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This neighborhood neither swung as hard for Biden as the more left-leaning neighborhoods nor swung as hard for Lacey as the more conservative neighborhoods. Gascón overperformed his citywide averages in Tinseltown by 3 percentage points, while Biden ran about average. And when it comes to the propositions, Tinseltown was fairly middle-of-the-pack. While Proposition 16 passed here with a slightly smaller margin compared with the citywide average, Propositions 15 and 21 basically matched the L.A. averages. The most significant differentiator was Proposition 22, which failed by the narrowest of margins (fewer than 5,000 votes out of almost 131,000 cast).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though its 2020 voting pattern is pretty similar to the city’s overall, Tinseltown doesn’t particularly resemble L.A as a whole. Among all the political neighborhoods, this one has by far the largest share of the white voting-age population, at 63 percent, and it’s the only political neighborhood where every ballot group is at least a plurality white. It also has the smallest share of the Hispanic voting-age population, at just 13 percent. Six of the seven ballot groups where Proposition 16 garnered less support than the city average had a higher share of voting-age white residents than the neighborhood and the city overall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hollywood stars and industry leaders have split on Caruso and Bass, with each candidate collecting endorsements from a number of <a href="https://variety.com/2022/politics/news/los-angeles-mayor-hollywood-karen-bass-rick-caruso-1235215269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big names</a>, and given the liberal but not <em>too </em>liberal voters of Tinseltown, it seems as though this neighborhood could go either way.   </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This fairly expansive political neighborhood lies closer to the city’s denser urban center compared with the Outer Suburbs (our final political neighborhood, and the most conservative). Propositions 15, 16 and 21 all passed here, unlike in the Outer Suburbs, but by the smallest margins among the city’s political neighborhoods. With the Asian and Black voting-age populations together totaling less than 15 percent, it’s predominantly white and Hispanic. Five ballot groups are majority Hispanic, five are majority white and the remaining five are more diverse.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Inner Suburbs’ support for more local rent control was driven primarily by five majority-Hispanic ballot groups. The five majority-white ballot groups, meanwhile, brought down the region’s support for raising nonresidential property taxes, voting 52 percent in favor versus the rest of the neighborhood’s 56 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Caruso owns a home in this neighborhood, as do a handful of his <a href="https://variety.com/2022/politics/news/los-angeles-mayor-hollywood-karen-bass-rick-caruso-1235215269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrity endorsers</a>, such as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2021-09-22/scooter-braun-spends-65-million-on-a-striking-brentwood-mansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record executive and Taylor Swift archrival Scooter Braun</a>. Still, the liberal-leaning tendencies of this group, particularly on issues related to housing and funding, indicate that Bass could find a foothold. </p>

This neighborhood was also the only one where Propositions 15, 16 and 21 all failed, as none surpassed 47 percent of the vote.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That this neighborhood is the most hesitant to commit to wealth redistribution and racial equity isn’t surprising when you consider its proximity to two of the historically conservative regions in the state: Orange County and northern L.A. County. The Outer Suburbs supported the reclassification of gig workers as contractors with a city-high 59 percent of the vote. Increasing funding for anti-incarceration programs squeaked by on the narrowest of margins, attracting 51 percent of the vote — 14 points lower than the city average.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The averages disguise some geographic divides. The San Fernando Valley itself is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-25/no-longer-the-older-whiter-valley-whom-do-these-suburban-voters-want-for-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politically and demographically diverse</a>, but as it nears the San Joaquin Valley to the north, wealthier communities like Woodland Hills and Chatsworth begin to tack right. And down south, the historically industrial Harbor communities and the “Shoestring Strip” are a little less conservative than their northern counterparts: Three of the four ballot groups voted in support of Measure J, compared with just four of the 12 comprising the political neighborhood’s northern reaches, and two voted in favor of Proposition 15.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Bass has made efforts to reach out to this political neighborhood, it’s reasonable to think that, given its support for Lacey two years ago, Caruso’s tough-on-crime messaging will resonate here. </p>

		</aside><hr><p data-paragraph="main">The partisan affiliation of the next mayor of L.A. seems clear, but the nature of his or her coalition is not. Los Angeles faces the same internal tensions as many other American cities: longstanding racial inequities, a population sensitive to rising crime and a housing crisis crushing residents, particularly those with lower incomes. Resolving those tensions will be more difficult than the city’s deep-blue hue might indicate. With relatively little agreement on what L.A. ought to do about these challenges, the next mayor will have to convince skeptical neighborhoods that his or her vision is the right one. </p>

<p>Just How Far Apart Are The Two Parties On Gun Control?</p>
<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/ryan-best/">Ryan Best</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/mary-radcliffe/">Mary Radcliffe</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/kaleigh-rogers/">Kaleigh Rogers</a></p>
<p>After what feels like a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/cities-us-rocked-memorial-day-weekend-shootings/story?id=85083526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relentless</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/reported-mass-shooting-upstate-york-tops-supermarket/story?id=84721175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequence</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/upshot/gun-control-polling-votes.html?smid=tw-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile</a> mass <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-elementary-school-reports-active-shooter-campus/story?id=84940951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shootings</a>, Americans are once again debating whether the country needs stronger regulations on guns. Many lawmakers and activists contend that, even in a country as bitterly polarized as the United States, some gun-control measures actually <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-fe72-d0c2-a9ae-ff7250f80000&amp;nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=0000014e-f115-dd93-ad7f-f91513e50001&amp;nlid=630318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attract wide support</a> — whether Americans actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/upshot/gun-control-polling-votes.html?smid=tw-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote for the measures they say they support</a> is another matter. However, when you compare specific questions by party response, there’s a gap.</p>
<p>Consider background checks. Morning Consult and Politico asked about this gun-control measure in March 2021. How do you think Republicans and Democrats responded?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” support requiring background checks for all gun purchasers?0%255075100</p>

<p>Guess</p>
<p>That’s pretty close to consensus, but already we can see that even broadly popular measures like background checks aren’t as appealing to some Republican voters as they are to Democratic voters. Let’s take a look at some other measures. In April 2021, the Pew Research Center asked about barring people with mental-health issues from buying guns. How do you think Republicans and Democrats responded?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” favor preventing people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s--gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center, April 5-11, 2021, among 5,109 adults</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>Again, we see a lot of agreement from both sides of the political spectrum. But this question was a little vague — what does it mean to prevent people from buying guns? And which mental illnesses should be included? An APM Research Lab survey on Extreme Risk Protection Orders tried to go deeper by asking about these so-called <a href="https://gunsandamerica.org/story/19/08/05/what-is-a-red-flag-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“red flag” laws</a>. These laws would allow family members, the police or certain other officials to seek an ERPO, a court order to temporarily take guns away from someone who may harm themselves or others. When asked whether they supported family-initiated ERPOs, how do you think Republicans and Democrats responded?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” support allowing a family member to seek a court order to temporarily take away guns if they feel a gun owner may harm themselves or others?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.apmresearchlab.org/gun-survey-red-flag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APM Research Lab, July 16-21, 2019, among 1,009 U.S. adult residents</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>Once again, a majority of both Democrats and Republicans support this kind of measure, though the gap is wider. When asked whether they would support the police initiating such an action, support dropped among both groups, to 78 percent among Democrats and 66 percent among Republicans.</p>
<p>How about a law banning assault weapons, something that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/understanding-1994-assault-weapons-ban-ended/story?id=65546858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress passed in 1994</a> (but let expire 10 years later) and an option that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-points-assault-weapons-ban-rational-option-gun-control-rcna31106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden recently promoted</a>?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” favor banning assault-style weapons?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s--gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center, April 5-11, 2021, among 5,109 adults</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>While Democratic support remains high, Republican support drops dramatically, even though the previous ban enjoyed some bipartisan support when it passed.</p>
<p>Another proposal that has <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/27/wisconsin-republicans-float-arming-teachers-after-school-shootings-robin-vos-kevin-nicholson/9944387002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been floated by politicians</a> is allowing teachers to carry weapons in school. How far apart do you think Republicans and Democrats are in supporting this measure?</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they “strongly” or “somewhat” favor allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K-12 schools?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s--gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center, April 5-11, 2021, among 5,109 adults</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>While a majority of Republicans support this idea, it’s not nearly as popular with them as some other measures — and it’s clearly unpopular with Democrats.</p>
<p>But getting gun-control laws passed is not just about whether voters support certain measures but also about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-gun-debate-needs-to-break-old-patterns/2022/05/26/f3acfede-dcfc-11ec-bc35-a91d0a94923b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how passionate voters are that those measures will work</a>. If a voter generally supports a new law but doesn’t think it will actually change much, they may not be as active in supporting it. A 2019 poll by ABC News/The Washington Post asked about this:</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they were “very” or “somewhat” confident that passing stricter gun-control laws would reduce mass shootings in this country?0%255075100</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/sept-2-5-2019-washington-post-abc-news-poll/d4e18b36-79bf-492d-91e3-d1c7a49d37e2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC News/The Washington Post, Sept. 2-5, 2019, among 1,003 adults</a></p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>However, when asked about improving mental-health monitoring and treatment, Republicans were much more confident that this would reduce mass shootings, even slightly more so than Democrats: 78 percent of Republicans said they were “very” or “somewhat” confident that this would work, and 75 percent of Democrats agreed.</p>
<p>Some differences in thinking about gun control may have to do with whether people own guns themselves.</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they, or anyone in their household, own a gun of any kind?0%255075100</p>

<p>Guess</p>
<p>Although most Americans don’t own a gun, a small share own a lot of them, which is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why the U.S. has more guns than people</a>.</p>
<p>While both Democrats and Republicans support some gun-control measures, broad support for extensive gun control is its own constitutional knot thanks to the Second Amendment. In April, YouGov/The Economist asked Americans which was more important: the right of people to own guns or protecting people from gun violence. (Respondents could also say if they thought both were equally important.)</p>
<p>What percentage of Republican and Democratic respondents do you think said they believe the right of people to own guns is more important than protecting people from gun violence?0%255075100</p>

<p>Guess</p>
<p>While a plurality of Republicans (49 percent) said both are equally important and a majority of Democrats (57 percent) said protecting people from violence is more important, the difference is striking. As the country debates how to end mass shootings like the ones that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/15/1099008586/mass-shootings-us-2022-tally-number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happen in the U.S. every day</a>, this gap may be the most meaningful of all.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday we ran through <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-20-california-primary-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 20 key races to watch in California</a> today, but now we’re back with a preview of 16 key races in the six other states holding primaries today. And the big races headed into tonight are high-profile Republican primaries that could affect the GOP’s chances in a number of competitive House seats. Additionally, a number of incumbents from both parties face primary challenges in deep blue or red seats, and Democrats have a competitive Senate primary in Iowa. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s dig into the interesting primaries in Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, starting with the states whose polls close earliest today. And make sure to join us at 7:30 p.m. Eastern for our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a> of the results!</p>

Tom Malinowski of New Jersey was already in danger. Thanks to redistricting, his 7th District has shifted 7 percentage points to the right. <p>Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>New Jersey</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 3rd Congressional District, 4th Congressional District, 5th Congressional District, 7th Congressional District, 8th Congressional District, 10th Congressional District, 11th Congressional District<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When the tiebreaker on New Jersey’s redistricting commission <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/redistricing/after-closed-door-process-wallace-chooses-democratic-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose the Democrats’ congressional map</a> in December 2021, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new lines</a> boosted the survival chances for three of the state’s four vulnerable Democratic House incumbents. But <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/11/malinowski-suporters-redistricting-524098" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the odd-man out</a> was Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski, whose <strong>7th District</strong> in the affluent suburbs west of Newark shifted from D+4 to R+3, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> Even before redistricting, though, Malinowski was already in danger, having <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/malinowski-defeats-kean-in-close-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely survived</a> the 2020 general election. He’s also attracted scrutiny since then <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-malinowski-stock-trades-congress-transparency-new-jersey-2021-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for failing to disclose</a> hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock transactions. Tom Kean Jr., a former state Senate Minority Leader and Malinowski’s 2020 opponent, is now seeking a rematch, and he’s favored to win the Republican primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while Kean is the choice of the <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidate-type/young-gun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national GOP</a> and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/kean-wins-morris-gop-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local party committees</a>, his long legislative career and status as a scion of a <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2015/04/10_things_to_know_about_tom_kean.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-known New Jersey political family</a> has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/nyregion/nj-tom-kean-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracted opposition</a> from his right. Kean’s main opponents are former evangelical pastor Phil Rizzo, state Assemblyman Erik Peterson and businessman John Henry Iseman, all of whom garnered some support at county conventions ahead of the primary. Rizzo is Kean’s most notable foe, having attracted attention as a <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/rizzo-raises-160k-significantly-trailing-keans-and-malinowskis-q1-totals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proponent for former President Donald Trump</a> in his <a href="https://nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/election-results/2021/2021-official-primary-results-governor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-place</a> performance in the 2021 GOP primary for governor. But it doesn’t seem that Rizzo’s “America First” message has put Kean in much danger, as Rizzo <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NJ/07/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised roughly one-tenth</a> of what Kean has ($228,000 versus $2.2 million). And with the five other candidates mostly <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2022/05/kean-could-win-democratic-held-nj-house-seat-this-fall-first-he-faces-trump-friendly-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressing similar themes</a> as Rizzo, the potential anti-Kean bloc of voters will probably fail to coalesce around one candidate, which should make Kean a strong favorite to win today.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Primaries will also decide the GOP challengers for the three potentially vulnerable Democratic incumbents who benefited from the new map. The <strong>5th District</strong> along the state’s northern border shifted from even to D+7, which could help Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer withstand the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP-leaning national political environment</a>. Viewed as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most moderate Democrats</a> in Congress, Gottheimer is also a top fundraiser as he had $13.4 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6NJ05171/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the bank as of May 18</a>. Gottheimer’s GOP opponent will most likely be Marine veteran Nick De Gregorio, who <a href="https://www.njpp.org/publications/report/does-the-county-line-matter-an-analysis-of-new-jerseys-2020-primary-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the support</a> of the local Republican organization in Bergen County, which makes up most of the district’s population. (New Jersey’s party organizations <a href="https://jpia.princeton.edu/news/how-new-jersey-political-parties-rig-ballot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are very powerful</a>, as their endorsement gives a candidate the “<a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=112633" target="_blank" rel="noopener">county line</a>” on primary ballots, which ensures prominent placement on the ballot and <a href="https://www.njpp.org/publications/report/does-the-county-line-matter-an-analysis-of-new-jerseys-2020-primary-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually ensures victory</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">De Gregorio <a href="https://www.insidernj.com/pallotta-v-de-gregorio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has argued</a> his military experience and outsider background make him the GOP’s best bet to defeat Gottheimer, but he first has to get past former banker Frank Pallotta, who lost to Gottheimer by 7.5 points in 2020. However, that shouldn’t be a problem as De Gregorio <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NJ05311/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has outraised</a> Pallotta $837,000 to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NJ05174/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$310,000</a>, despite Pallotta’s past support <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/trump-endorses-pallotta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Trump in 2020</a>. Democrats seem to agree that De Gregorio is the stronger Republican, <a href="https://savejersey.com/2022/05/gottheimer-opens-his-warchest-to-attack-pallotta-or-boost-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeing as Gottheimer</a> and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/de-gregorio-outraising-outspending-sluggish-pallotta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his allies</a> have sent mailings to Republican voters attacking Pallotta as being too Trump-like in a not-so-subtle attempt to get them to back Pallotta instead of De Gregorio.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door to Gottheimer in the North Jersey suburbs, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s <strong>11th District</strong> also moved to the left in redistricting, going from D+1 to D+11. This has made Sherrill, another strong fundraiser (she’s got <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NJ11142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5.6 million in the bank</a>), more of a reach target for Republicans. Her most likely GOP opponent is Morris County Commissioner Tayfun Selen, <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/essex-gop-backs-selen-for-congress-in-nj-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has the backing</a> of the party committees in Morris and Essex counties, which contain most GOP primary voters in the district. However, former assistant Passaic County Prosecutor Paul DeGroot has that county organization’s backing, and the two candidates have raised similar amounts, with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NJ11178/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selen bringing in $256,000</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NJ11186/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeGroot $244,000</a>. That said, DeGroot has self-funded most of his campaign and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/republicans-barely-raising-any-money-in-race-to-challenge-sherrill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely raised anything</a> in the pre-primary fundraising period. Regardless, the GOP nominee here will need the environment to be especially favorable to defeat Sherrill, but that isn’t out of the question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No incumbent got more help in redistricting than Democratic Rep. Andy Kim, whose <strong>3rd District</strong> in South Jersey swung 14 points to the left, from R+5 to D+9. Like Sherrill, this shift has made Kim more of a reach target for the GOP, but the leading GOP contender, Bob Healey, could prove a formidable foe. Healey owns a yacht construction company and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/healey-outraises-outspends-smith-by-wide-margin-in-nj-3-gop-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the backing</a> of every county GOP organization in the district. <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NJ/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He’s also raised</a> $1.2 million, including $260,000 out of his own pocket. His spending has dwarfed that of fellow Republican and gym owner Ian Smith, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NJ03282/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only raised</a> $154,000. But Smith <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2022/06/can-nj-gym-owner-turn-notoriety-into-a-victory-in-tuesdays-congressional-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did attract national attention</a> in 2020 for refusing to obey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s directive to temporarily close his gym to reduce the spread of COVID-19, <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/02/nj-gym-owner-at-odds-with-gov-murphy-to-speak-at-nations-top-conservative-activist-conference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even speaking</a> at the Conservative Political Action Conference last year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also three seats that are either safely in Democratic or Republican hands that are worth a quick glance, too. In the Jersey City-based <strong>8th District</strong>, Democratic Rep. Albio Sires is retiring, leaving behind a D+47 open seat. Democratic leaders <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2022/01/06/menendez-jr-formally-announces-candidacy-for-congress-in-new-jerseys-8th-district-1404323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have coalesced around</a> Port Authority Commissioner Robert Menendez Jr., the son of Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/nyregion/robert-menendez-jr-congress-albio-sires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represented this area</a> in the House before he moved to the Senate. <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/05/31/menendez-jr-eyes-congressional-seat-as-critics-cry-nepotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Despite charges of nepotism</a>, the younger Menendez has only attracted minor primary opposition, so he’ll likely be the district’s next representative. Meanwhile, next door in the Newark-based <strong>10th District</strong>, Democratic Rep. Donald Payne Jr. is likely to win renomination in a D+58 seat that’s about half Black. But progressive activist Imani Oakley <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NJ/10/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised almost half</a> as much money as the incumbent, $426,000 versus Payne’s $947,000 and is trying to run to his left. Still, Payne has a very liberal record, <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/payne-solid-progressive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making it difficult to paint him as too moderate</a>. <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/payne-has-6-1-cash-advantage-over-oakley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He also has the backing</a> of all local Democratic organizations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, redistricting shifted the South Jersey-based <strong>4th District</strong>, sharply to the right, from R+13 to R+28. This gave 21-term Republican Rep. Chris Smith a more conservative seat, which, on the one hand, was good news for Smith as it made his seat easier to defend in November. But on the other hand, it has also meant that he could attract a challenge from his right, but Smith’s intraparty opponents <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NJ/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t raised much money</a>, and <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/gop-local-officials-nearly-unanimous-in-support-of-chris-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he maintains strong local party support</a>, so the thing to watch here is just how much of a protest vote he draws.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 4th Congressional District<br><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s only one race to keep a close eye on in Mississippi, and that is the GOP primary in the deep red <strong>4th District</strong> along the Gulf Coast. Six-term Republican Rep. Steven Palazzo has found himself in hot water since the Office of Congressional Ethics <a href="https://oce.house.gov/reports/investigations/oce-reportreferral-regarding-rep-steven-palazzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in late 2020</a> that there was “substantial reason to believe” Palazzo <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2020/11/25/steven-palazzo-ethics-investigation-is-the-congressmans-campaign-account-a-slush-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had misused campaign funds</a> for personal expenditures, a scandal that encouraged six primary challengers to jump into the race. And while they might end up splitting the anti-incumbent vote, that won’t help Palazzo much because Mississippi <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-runoffs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is one of seven states</a> that requires a candidate to win an outright majority to clinch a nomination. Should no candidate cross the 50 percent threshold, a runoff between the top two vote-getters will occur on June 28.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With no recent polling, it’s unclear how endangered Palazzo is, but his main opponents appear to be Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell, state Sen. Brice Wiggins and retired banker Clay Wagner. Each <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MS/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has brought in</a> at least $240,000, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0MS04120/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared with</a> Palazzo’s $598,000 (a weak figure for an incumbent), with Wagner <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MS04274/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised</a> $535,000 overall thanks to $300,000 in personal loans. All of the candidates running have criticized Palazzo for the campaign finance investigation and <a href="https://www.wjtv.com/news/politics/focused-on-politics/no-show-palazzo-congressman-still-under-investigation-absent-from-campaign-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for not attending candidate forums</a>, but Wiggins might have his own campaign finance troubles, as his state Senate campaign committee <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/05/18/brice-wiggins-congress-race-campaign-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has entirely funded</a> the pro-Wiggins super PAC spending in the congressional race, a potential violation of federal law. We should also mention that the challenger with the most cash is actually businessman Carl Boyanton, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0MS04161/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who loaned his own campaign</a> $550,000. But Boyanton only won 9 percent against Palazzo in the 2020 GOP primary, so one of the other Republicans is a better bet to force a runoff — or even defeat Palazzo.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> At-Large Congressional District, governor<br><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Barring any big surprises, both South Dakota’s lone representative and governor should easily cruise to renomination, but both incumbents face primary challenges from their right that are worth keeping an eye on. First, in the state’s <strong>At-Large District</strong>, Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson faces state Rep. Taffy Howard, <a href="https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/black-hills-lawmaker-taffy-howard-standing-in-way-of-dusty-johnsons-third-term-in-congress/article_9456515a-f808-5e2f-91e5-ab772454009a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has criticized</a> Johnson’s vote to certify the 2020 presidential election results. Howard, however, has <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/SD/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised just about $310,000</a>, which pales in comparison to Johnson’s $1.9 million. And a <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2022/05/incumbents-have-solid-support-republican-primary-and-south-dakotans-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May survey from South Dakota State University</a> found Johnson leading Howard 53 percent to 17 percent among likely GOP primary voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile in the primary for <strong>governor</strong>, Republican Gov. Kristi Noem faces an intraparty challenge from state Rep. Steven Haugaard. Haugaard <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2021/11/17/steve-haugaard-criticizes-kristi-noem-south-dakota-governor-primary-election-campaign-launch/8644867002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had criticized</a> Noem for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-south-dakota-legislation-kristi-noem-bills-59127fe856b9727300bd9264d9a38eff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetoing a bill</a> in 2021 that would have banned transgender girls from participating in high school sports, but Noem likely dulled conservative frustration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/04/noem-transgender-athlete-ban-south-dakota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by signing similar legislation into law in 2022</a>. Haugaard’s <a href="https://listen.sdpb.org/politics/2022-05-31/former-house-speaker-challenges-noem-for-governor-nomination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also tried to take</a> Noem to task for her flights on a state-owned plane to political events, which is <a href="https://www.keloland.com/news/local-news/government-accountability-board-moves-forward-on-gov-noem-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to a complaint</a> that’s before the state government accountability board. But Haugaard just hasn’t made inroads against Noem, who notably has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/593420-trump-endorses-noems-reelection-bid-in-south-dakota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>. That SDSU survey also found Noem well ahead, 61 percent to 17 percent.</p>

Abby Finkenauer is fighting an uphill battle to unseat seven-term Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley. <p>Charlie Neibergall / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Iowa</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch: </strong>U.S. Senate, 3rd Congressional District<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the race for <strong>Senate</strong>, seven-term Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley is favored to win reelection in November. Nevertheless, Democrats do have a competitive primary between former Rep. Abby Finkenauer and retired Navy Admiral Michael Franken. On paper, Finkenauer looks like the favorite. Despite narrowly losing reelection in her former district in 2020, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/IA/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she’s outraised Franken</a> $3.7 million to $2.8 million, and she’s also acquired endorsements from high-profile organizations like <a href="https://www.emilyslist.org/news/entry/emilys-list-endorses-abby-finkenauer-for-u.s.-senate-in-iowa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMILY’s List</a>, the <a href="https://www.lcv.org/article/lcv-action-fund-announces-first-round-of-non-incumbent-senate-endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">League of Conservation Voters</a> and <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/campaigns-elections/finkenauer-picks-up-major-iowa-union-backing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organized labor groups</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Finkenauer only made the ballot after the <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/15/abby-finkenauer-democratic-senate-primary-2022-election-ballot-iowa-supreme-court-ruling/7313038001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa Supreme Court overturned</a> a lower-court decision that ruled she’d failed to qualify for the ballot, and Franken has actually outraised Finkenauer $2.4 million to $1.8 million in 2022. Moreover, a Franken campaign poll conducted by Change Research <a href="https://insideelections.com/Mike_Franken_Iowa_Poll_5-16-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found him running neck and neck</a> with Finkenauer in early May, a big shift from a 27-point deficit a month earlier. This finding, however, ran sharply counter to a <a href="https://abbyfinkenauer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/122/Abby-Finkenauer-Primary-Poll-Memo-April-7-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finkenauer-sponsored poll</a> from early April by GBAO that found her up 49 points. But Franken may indeed have gained ground, as <a href="https://www.insideelections.com/news/article/iowa-senate-franken-poll-tied-finkenauer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Elections reported</a> in mid-May that Franken had spent far more than Finkenauer on ads for TV and Facebook. This race looks genuinely uncertain heading into today, although the mission of unseating Grassley will remain a tall order for whoever wins come November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne will face a difficult reelection contest this fall in the <strong>3rd District</strong>, an R+2 seat that includes Des Moines. That’s why it will be important to see who wins the GOP primary today. And it’s shaping up <a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/political-news/2022-05-31/meet-the-three-republicans-hoping-to-ride-a-gop-wave-in-iowas-3rd-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be a two-way battle</a> between state Sen. Zach Nunn and financial planner Nicole Hasso. An Air Force veteran, Nunn has tried to promote his conservative accomplishments in the Iowa legislature, while Hasso, who is Black, has played up her outsider credentials and religious faith. Nunn held a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/IA/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slight fundraising edge</a> heading into the final stretch, as he’d raised $882,000 to Hasso’s $602,000 and had slightly more than twice as much cash on hand. But regardless of who wins, the GOP will have a real chance to capture this swingy seat in the fall. </p>

Michelle Lujan Grisham has led to a crowded Republican primary field. <p>Jim Weber / Santa Fe New Mexican via AP</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>New Mexico</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch: </strong>1st Congressional District, 2nd Congressional District, governor<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race for <strong>governor</strong> is the main event in the Land of Enchantment, where Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham could be vulnerable come November in this D+7 state. Public opinion appears to be pretty split on her, too, as a <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=06d0133e-5d47-4d4e-bf7b-a91519388b9e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KOB-TV/SurveyUSA poll</a> of registered voters released in early May found Lujan Grisham’s approval/disapproval rating at 48 percent/46 percent, similar to what <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/28/governor-approval-ratings-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult found</a> earlier this year. As a result, a crowded Republican primary field has developed, but there’s a clear favorite: Former meteorologist Mark Ronchetti, who lost the state’s 2020 U.S. Senate race by 6 points, running somewhat stronger than Trump did in New Mexico.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ronchetti leads in the polls and in fundraising over his primary opponents, who include state Rep. Rebecca Dow, retired Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Greg Zanetti and Sandoval County Commissioner Jay Block. Ronchetti <a href="https://login.cfis.sos.state.nm.us/#/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $2.7 million, with Dow the next-closest at $1.5 million. Two recent surveys also put Ronchetti in the mid-40s, with no other candidate polling above 20 percent. In the <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=d97dbd57-3dab-41c3-af65-5829328b2eaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same KOB-TV/SurveyUSA poll</a>, Rochetti garnered 44 percent, 32 points ahead of Block, while the front-runner attracted 45 percent in a <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2501645/ronchetti-enjoys-big-lead-over-gop-rivals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mid-May survey</a> from Albuquerque Journal/Research &amp; Polling Inc., 28 points ahead of Dow. Looking ahead to the likely Lujan Grisham-Ronchetti general election matchup, the <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=4a522d37-094b-4138-b451-2a497f1da2bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KOB-TV/SurveyUSA poll found</a> the incumbent only up 4 points, 47 percent to 43 percent, indicative of how competitive the race could be.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in the <strong>2nd District</strong>, Republican Rep. Yvette Herrell will face a tough reelection fight in November after the state’s new, Democratic-drawn <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional map</a> shifted the southwestern New Mexico seat all the way from R+14 to D+4. Herrell’s November opponent will probably be Las Cruces City Councilor Gabe Vasquez, whom the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href="https://redtoblue.dccc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has named to its Red to Blue</a> candidate list running in seats the party hopes to flip. Vazquez <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NM02191/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $776,000 so far, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NM02217/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly outstripping</a> the $65,000 raised by physician Darshan Patel, the other Democrat in the primary. However unlikely, it’s still possible that Patel gives Vazquez a run for his money as he’s is running to Vasquez’s left to some extent. <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2022/06/02/nm-primary-election-2022-gabe-vasquez-darshan-patel-healthcare-gun-control/9969656002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patel supports Medicare for All</a> and, as the former president of a resident physician union, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NM02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has benefited from</a> $64,000 in outside spending by the Service Employees International Union (which <a href="https://www.cirseiu.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his union is affiliated with</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-new-mexico-1st-special-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a special election</a> in 2021 to represent the Alburquerque-based <strong>1st District</strong>, and while it’s a D+11 seat, a difficult environment for Democrats in 2022 could put it in Republicans’ range. The two Republicans in the race are retired police officer Michelle Garcia Holmes, who lost the 2020 election in this seat, and businessman Louie Sanchez, who co-owns an indoor shooting range. Garcia Holmes may have a slight upper hand in the primary contest, considering she has name recognition from her 2020 run. She also entered the final stretch of the race <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NM/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with about three times as much money</a> as Sanchez had, although Sanchez had raised slightly more overall. Without any polling, though, it’s tough to say which Republican will come out on top.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22145803554063-711.jpg" alt="Montana U.S. House candidate Ryan Zinke" width="840" height="560" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22145803554063-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22145803554063-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22145803554063-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Former Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke has raised over three times as much money as his nearest rival in the race for Montana’s 1st District. <p>Matthew Brown / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Montana</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st Congressional District<br><strong>Polls close: </strong>10 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the first time in three-plus decades, Montana will host two congressional elections after the census reapportionment process gave Montana back its second district, which it lost in the 1990 census. Republican Rep. Matt Rosendale is running in the safely red 2nd District (R+30), so the Montana race to watch is the <strong>1st District</strong>, an R+10 seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/montana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">located in the western third of the state</a>. This district leans Republican, but it could still be competitive in some years. For instance, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester would have <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::bd51aeae-2e06-43db-9cc4-b25e146dac22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried it by 10 points</a> in 2018, which was a Democratic-leaning environment. But in a GOP-leaning environment, the race will likely favor whomever Republicans pick today as their nominee. And that primary is mostly a question of whether Ryan Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior and Montana congressman, can win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having raised $2.9 million, Zinke <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H4MT01041/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holds a substantial monetary edge</a> over former state legislator Al Olszewski, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MT02084/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who’s raised</a> just $710,000, and businesswoman and pastor Mary Todd, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2MT00112/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who’s raised</a> $448,000 (with $323,000 in self-funding). Zinke <a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2022-05-17/trump-endorses-ryan-zinke-during-a-tele-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also has Trump’s endorsement</a>. But <a href="https://flatheadbeacon.com/2022/04/27/congressional-gop-candidates-take-aim-at-zinke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the anti-establishment</a> Olszewksi and Todd might still attract support with their criticisms of GOP leaders in Congress and arguments that the 2020 election was stolen. Zinke’s critics have also seized on the amount of time he’s spent <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/10/08/ryan-zinke-congress-montana-santa-barbara-2022-514780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living in California</a>, and they’ve pointed to a <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/investigators-slap-zinke-on-candor-ethics-in-real-estate-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of the Interior report</a> published in February that concluded Zinke had behaved unethically while in the Cabinet by working on a land deal that involved a foundation he’d established. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Olszewski and Todd may end up splitting the anti-Zinke vote, making it easier for him to win the primary. Meanwhile on the Democratic side, public health expert Cora Neumann <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MT/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had almost four times as much money</a> in the bank as attorney Monical Tranel heading into the campaign’s home stretch, so she is the Democrats’ likeliest choice for the fall campaign, although this election cycle will likely prove to be an uphill slog for her.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>The following is an updated version of </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-we-prevent-mass-shootings-by-preventing-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>this article</em></a><em>, published in 2019.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Imagine a doctor who wanted to treat a broken leg with chemotherapy. Or treat cancer with a cast.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just because cancer and broken legs are both things that happen to the body doesn’t mean they call for the same treatment. These are the kinds of issues policymakers face every day. Take gun violence. It feels like one big problem, but it’s actually <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bunch of different problems</a> that don’t necessarily have a single cause. But it’s also easy to get so focused on the differences between types of gun violence that we miss the unexpected connections. Just like a fragile, cracked bone could be a symptom of certain kinds of cancers, researchers are finding evidence that suicides and mass shootings can often be different expressions of the same problem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I first reported on this connection back in 2019, as part of trying to explain why a suicide prevention tool — “red flag laws” that enable family members and law enforcement to determine that a person is a threat to themselves or others and temporarily remove guns from their home — was being proposed as a way to prevent mass shootings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/solution/extreme-risk-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 states have enacted red flag laws</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/31/1102260566/encore-do-red-flag-laws-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ve had mixed results in violence prevention</a>. But the connections between suicidality and mass shootings have just gotten stronger. “Many of these mass shootings are angry suicides,”  James Densley, professor of criminal justice at Minnesota’s Metropolitan State University, told me four years ago. And now there’s even more evidence to suggest that’s true. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It isn’t news that a lot of mass shooters suffer from suicidal ideation, said James Lankford, a professor of criminology at the University of Alabama. But it wasn’t until he published <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ftam0000166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2021 study comparing mass shooters</a> to other demographic groups that he truly realized just how much <em>more</em> mass shooters had in common with people who die by suicide than they did with other kinds of homicide offenders. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Homicides are rarely premeditated but public mass shootings almost always are,” Lankford said. So are suicides. While mass shootings were 3.8 times more likely to be premeditated than standard homicides, they were only 1.2 times more likely to premeditated compared to suicide. Mass shooters were more likely than other homicide offenders to act alone. They were more likely to be killed by law enforcement. And while standard homicide offenders aren’t particularly likely to experience suicidal tendencies, in Lankford’s study anyway, mass shooters were a bit more likely to have a history of suicidal ideation than even people who actually died by suicide. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lankford is not the first person to find connections between suicide and mass shootings. In a <a href="https://www.theviolenceproject.org/mass-shooters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database of more than 150 mass shootings</a> that took place between 1966 and 2018, Densley found that about half the attackers in his sample had demonstrated signs of feeling suicidal before they hurt others. A different set of researchers who analyzed 41 school shooters for the Secret Service and Department of Education found that <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">78 percent had a history of thinking about or attempting suicide</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’ve even talked to a couple of people who tried to kill themselves but failed and then launched an attack because they were hoping police would kill them,” said Marisa Randazzo, a former chief psychologist for the Secret Service who now consults on active threat assessment with schools and other organizations, told me.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A third set of researchers, who compiled the details of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1556-4029.12312" target="_blank" rel="noopener">119 lone-actor terrorists</a>, did not specifically track whether the people in their data set had thought about or attempted suicide, but the researchers told me they also found significant overlap between mass shootings and choices that suggested suicidal tendencies. “A fairly sizeable subset only planned this to be a one-off event” — that is, something they didn’t return from — said Paul Gill, a professor of security and crime science at University College London and the researcher in charge of that data set. “They were taking preparations to maximize the chances of death by cop or their own hand.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, acts of mass violence are functioning as a method of suicide. “These are individuals who are planning in advance to commit a crime for which there’s almost no chance they’ll avoid life imprisonment or death as a direct result of the crime,” Lankford said. “It’s very reasonable to say that they’re not very invested in their current lives, or their future lives.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That fact has implications for policy and prevention. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A connection to suicide means armed guards are unlikely to be a deterrent to mass shooters, Densley said. In 2021, he published a paper that analyzed 133 cases of school shootings between 1980 and 2018 and found that the ones <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2776515" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where armed guards were present had a death rate 2.8 times higher</a> than those with no armed guards on scene. Densley thinks this could partly be because in the eyes of a shooter exhibiting suicidal ideation, good guys with guns are a feature, not a bug. They may see a higher chance of death for themselves and they may go in more heavily armed — and more innocent people could be caught in the ensuing shootouts. And even if that’s not the case, Lankford said, a shooter having armed guards to fight creates a story that increases the killer’s chances of achieving notoriety and fame.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The connection to suicide also means potential mass shooters can easily slip under the radar of law enforcement, who are trained to deal with crime, not crisis, Lankford said. It’s not uncommon for future mass shooters to come to the attention of law enforcement before their major attack, but those interactions often go nowhere because that person has no connection to violent crime or gangs, and they have no previous criminal record. “Those questions aren’t useful in assessing the threat of a mass shooter,” he told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And these kinds of shooters remain difficult to profile. Even knowing the connection to suicidality doesn’t particularly help because most suicidal people aren’t a danger to others, just themselves. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there is some good news here. Mass shootings are very often preceded by what experts describe as cries for help — shooters tell other people about their plans, they make threats, they describe their desire to kill and be killed. In a 2021 study of 170 perpetrators of mass shootings, researchers found that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">44 percent</a> had leaked specific details of their own plans beforehand. Multiple studies have found that family and friends of a mass shooter are often aware that something is wrong long before the violence happens. That happened one-third of the time in Densley’s database, 64 percent in Gill’s, and 81 percent in the cases Randazzo logged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this is why many experts who study the epidemiology of mass shooters like the idea of red flag laws as a preventative. Even once you identify some <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/reports/mass-shootings-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details that many of the attackers have in common</a>, such a large swath of the population shares these traits that the “profile” is fairly useless for prevention. Red flag laws circumvent that problem by focusing less on a type of person and more on a type of emotional and situational crisis — where the people involved aren’t necessarily “bad guys” but troubled individuals in need of help. Gill thinks of it as a public health approach, analogous to the way we treat physical health problems that are hard to profile.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We know that raised cholesterol leads to heart problems. We don’t have the ability to predict who in the general population who already has raised cholesterol will go on to have a heart attack. So we put in place prevention policies to try to decrease cholesterol in the whole ‘at risk’ community,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the researchers who study mass violence, what’s appealing about red flag laws is that these rules have the potential to shift the emphasis from a cut-and-dried checklist of dangerous traits to a more nuanced system that accounts for a person’s big-picture emotional state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Right now, experts said, even when friends, family and teachers know something is wrong with a potential shooter, they may not be able to actually do much about it. Sometimes people don’t know who to tell. Sometimes they choose not to tell in order to avoid sending a loved one to prison for crimes they haven’t yet committed. Sometimes the authorities can’t do anything because the nature of the threat doesn’t include illegal behavior.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All these researchers supported red flag laws because they could create a clear plan of action for friends and family concerned about a loved one’s combination of emotional crisis and violent threats. It creates a place to take concerns, a system to evaluate those concerns and a means of mitigating them. That’s particularly true, researchers said, if national red flag laws are set up so that the system isn’t punitive. Ideally, the process would focus on helping a person get through to the other side of an emotional crisis rather than putting them in jail. It’s also important, the researchers said, to make sure the laws are focused on professional evaluations of overall behavior, not checklists.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And there’s some evidence this could work. An analysis of records from California, where one of the first red flag laws was enacted in 2016, found <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M19-2162?journalCode=aim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 21 cases where the laws had been used</a> specifically because people around a person were worried about their potential to commit a mass shooting. As of 2019, none of those people had followed through on that potential. It’s impossible to know, however, how those risks would have played out if the red flag hadn’t been there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if those parts work together the way they should, then red flag laws really could be a useful tool for combating the segment of mass shootings that function like very public, violent suicides. “There’s an important piece when we interviewed school shooters and active threat cases,” Randazzo said. “They feel very strongly about two things: They have to carry out the violence, they have no options left, but they also don’t want to do it and hope someone will stop them.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2021, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly two dozen states</a> passed new voting restrictions in response to the lie that <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread voter fraud</a> cost former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/12/trumps-big-lie-was-bigger-than-just-stolen-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2020 presidential election</a>. Assessing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-republican-push-to-restrict-voting-could-affect-our-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the toll these laws take on the voting process</a> is challenging, though. In Texas’s March 1 primary, for instance, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/18/texas-rejected-election-ballots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 10 percent of absentee ballots</a> were rejected, while <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/14/texas-primary-voting-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turnout overall was in line with recent midterm years</a>. But in <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/24/republicans-parade-georgias-record-early-turnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia’s May 24 primary</a>, there was actually an uptick in early voting numbers from 2018. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, early turnout in Georgia’s primary election <a href="https://sos.ga.gov/news/georgia-election-law-results-record-early-voting-turnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set a record in the state</a> for a midterm election, according to the office of Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state. And overall, unofficial election results show that over 1.9 million eligible Georgia voters cast a ballot this year in Georgia’s gubernatorial primary, compared to roughly 1.2 million who did so in 2018. As a result, some election observers and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/24/republicans-parade-georgias-record-early-turnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican officials</a> are now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/27/georgia-primary-turnout-exposes-falsehood-in-biden-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismissing the idea</a> that restrictive voting laws will curtail voting, as Georgia has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-georgias-new-voting-law-is-such-a-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most stringent laws</a> on the books<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-georgias-new-voting-law-is-such-a-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Writing off the effects of laws like Georgia’s at this early juncture is a mistake, however. As I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-things-to-watch-going-into-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote earlier this year</a>, <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-022822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s conflicting research</a> on the effects of certain voting restrictions, like stricter voter ID laws or limitations on <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/21-011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absentee voting</a>. Let’s unpack what happened in Georgia, though, to better understand why it’s important not to draw too many conclusions right now about the effects these laws will have. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, many have pointed to high voter turnout in Georgia as proof that concerns around the state’s restrictive voting law were overblown, but remember: It was never a foregone conclusion that states with the most restrictive laws would see lower turnout. According to the <a href="https://sos.ga.gov/news/georgia-election-law-results-record-early-voting-turnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secretary of state’s office</a>, that early turnout marked a 168 percent increase from the 2018 primary.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Georgia secretary of state also noted a sharp increase in early voting turnout compared to the 2020 primary, but the COVID-19 pandemic makes it harder to make an apples-to-apples comparison given &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-absentee-voting-looked-like-in-all-50-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the uptick in absentee voting&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://sos.ga.gov/news/georgia-voting-adapts-surges-past-1-million-vote-milestone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>19</sup></a> But higher turnout doesn’t mean Georgia’s law didn’t have an effect. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, maybe turnout was high for the simple reason that there were a number of interesting races on the ballot. On the Republican side, for instance, the gubernatorial primary featured a showdown between Gov. Brian Kemp and former Sen. David Perdue, while the secretary of state primary saw Raffensperger, Georgia’s chief election officer, face a challenge from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/us/politics/jody-hice-raffensperger-trump-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-endorsed</a> Rep. Jody Hice. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, redistricting essentially forced Reps. Carolyn Bourdeaux and Lucy McBath <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-primaries-may-be-trumps-biggest-test-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to both run in the same district</a> — the 7th. It’s also possible that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/primary-election-results-latest-news/card/georgia-saw-high-early-voting-turnout-amid-controversy-over-voting-rules-zHqDQUAU5A3vZuOFHCD7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high number of GOP primary ballots</a> was due, in part, to a number of Democrats <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-donald-trump-georgia-campaign-2016-congress-df4fa72d2d4a1e4d9344d61c0a3d4b9e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting in the Republican primary</a> in an attempt to stop Trump-backed candidates from winning. In other words, it’s possible that turnout might have been even <em>higher</em> without the restrictions. We just don’t know.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What we do know is that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/upshot/georgia-election-law-turnout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research has found</a> that strict voting laws can backfire and make people more determined to cast a ballot despite the hurdles set in front of them. Consider what happened in North Dakota in 2018. That year, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/19/669361542/native-american-turnout-in-north-dakota-reached-unprecedented-levels-in-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Native American tribal leaders and field organizers</a> concerned about turnout following the passage of a stringent voter ID law responded by <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/north-dakotas-native-american-tribes-scrambling-print-ids/story?id=58999039" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rushing to print new tribal IDs</a>. As a result, during that year’s fall midterm, Native American counties recorded <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/north-dakota-reservations-record-voter-turnout-amid-fears/story?id=59038845" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic turnout numbers</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/21/voting-is-surging-georgia-despite-controversial-new-election-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some reporting suggests</a> that Georgia Democrats carried out a similarly energized ground game. In Spalding County, for example, activists moved “Souls to the Polls” events to Saturday after the county’s board of elections <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/georgia-republicans-purge-black-democrats-county-election-boards-2021-12-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned early voting on Sundays</a>. Other statewide voting rights groups similarly amped up voter registration and efforts to educate Georgians about how the new law would affect their ability to cast a ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, it’s possible that depressed turnout was avoided in Georgia only because campaigns and voting-rights groups spent a ton of resources to help people navigate the restrictions. But if Georgia’s restrictive voting law hadn’t passed, those resources could have been used elsewhere.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another important beat to remember is that high turnout, or whether people voted, doesn’t give us the full picture of how <em>hard </em>it was for them to vote — and that matters, too. Research shows that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244020950376" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if a person is truly motivated</a> to vote, they will almost always find a way. But it’s still not ideal if they have to jump through hoops to do it. And as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/21/voting-is-surging-georgia-despite-controversial-new-election-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a> reported, some voters in Georgia were unwilling — or scared — to cast an absentee ballot given how the new state law makes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-annotated.html#link-1b20039a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mail voting harder</a> by enforcing stricter ID requirements and <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/fewer-voters-used-drop-boxes-after-georgia-voting-law-limited-them/WTCPBE7QH5HBBEJB37RSC3FQYY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limiting the number of drop boxes</a> that can be placed in a county. Ultimately, that fear of ballot rejection, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/fewer-voters-used-drop-boxes-after-georgia-voting-law-limited-them/WTCPBE7QH5HBBEJB37RSC3FQYY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alongside new drop box and ID requirements</a>, may have deterred even more voters from casting their vote this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this was still a primary, too, where the electorate tends to be both more experienced, engaged and partisan. So it’s unclear whether the existing state law will deter more voters in the general election, especially if they’re first-time or infrequent voters who are less familiar with navigating electoral administration.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, in general, laws like Georgia’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/upshot/georgia-election-law-turnout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were never going to have a large-scale effect</a> on turnout or the horse race: It’s their effect on individual citizens that matters most. We’ve never seen such an aggressive and widespread <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-republican-push-to-restrict-voting-could-affect-our-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP-led effort</a> to pass anti-democratic voting restrictions, and the totality of the laws passed this cycle makes it hard to predict their effects. But even if, say, 100 people were disenfranchised because of the law — a number so small that it’d be a rounding error in the overall numbers — that still wouldn’t be fair to those 100 people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, we still don’t have the official absentee rejection rate for Georgia. That’s a big piece of missing data that will give us a fuller picture of turnout, as well as the effect of Georgia’s election law — and other, similar anti-democratic laws that <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLY5UUJDxC6y2Rxf6MjV0nfsWDFIEHI8/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrict absentee voting</a>. We do have those numbers for Texas, of course, which were abnormally high compared with previous elections (e.g., <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/18/texas-rejected-election-ballots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there was a rejection rate</a> of less than 1 percent for the 2020 presidential election, versus a 13 percent rejection rate in this year’s primary). But that said, those stats might <em>overstate</em> the effect of the laws. A spike in rejections shouldn’t be too surprising when a law recently changed how people are allowed to vote; it’s likely, too, that rejection rates in future elections will decline, as people get used to the new rules.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s important to remember, though, that you can’t out-vote or out-organize voter suppression tactics, and it would be disingenuous to say that the new restrictive laws had no tangible effects on voters since we just don’t know, for instance, how many people didn’t vote or experienced difficulties <em>because </em>of the new law. On top of that, since primary elections tend to draw highly engaged voters, it’s way too soon to draw any conclusions about the effects of these new laws. That means that the real test of these restrictions will likely come in November. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to the busiest primary week of the year. On June 7, seven states will vote, more than on any other primary date in 2022. As a result, there are <em>a lot</em> of races to cover, but one state stands above the rest: California. Because of the state’s size, we will dig into 20 — count ’em, 20 — races. And never fear, we’ll be back tomorrow with a preview of the six other states that also have elections on Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before we run through California’s key races, there is one important twist to keep in mind: California has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-05-16/california-top-two-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a top-two primary</a>, in which all candidates run on the same ballot, regardless of party, and the top-two vote getters advance to the general election. This means it’s entirely possible that a party gets locked out from the general election in November, especially in deep red or blue seats where most voters will vote for candidates from one party. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/californias-jungle-primary-might-screw-over-both-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This even happens in competitive seats</a> sometimes, too. When a party has many candidates running who split the party’s vote, two candidates from the other party can finish first and second. Finally, the top-two vote by party — the vote share for all Democrats running versus all Republicans — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/upshot/california-will-have-clues-for-the-nation-how-to-watch-the-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually tracks relatively close</a> to the general election vote, meaning that the state’s June 7 primary results can be used — albeit with caveats — as a harbinger.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that, let’s dig into California’s vast array of races to watch.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> Special election for California’s 22nd Congressional District; top-two primaries for U.S. Senate, 3rd Congressional District, 5th Congressional District, 8th Congressional District, 9th Congressional District, 13th Congressional District, 15th Congressional District, 22nd Congressional District, 27th Congressional District, 34th Congressional District, 37th Congressional District, 40th Congressional District, 41st Congressional District, 42nd Congressional District, 45th Congressional District, 47th Congressional District, 49th Congressional District, governor, attorney general</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>11 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with the three statewide races of interest. In the primary for <strong>governor</strong>, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s political circumstances could hardly be more different than they were almost a year ago. Back then, Newsom faced a recall election, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gavin-newsom-has-reason-to-worry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling suggested</a> he might be in danger. But Newsom went on <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2021-recall/sov/11-sov-summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to easily</a> defeat <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recall</a>, which <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-12/gavin-newsom-will-face-little-known-challengers-for-a-second-term-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helps explain</a> why he only faces token Republican opposition now. A <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-03/2022-california-primary-election-gavin-newsom-rob-bonta-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late May survey</a> of likely voters from the University of California, Berkeley, Institute of Governmental Studies for the Los Angeles Times found Newsom comfortably in the lead. The poll also found GOP state Sen. Brian Dahle with the second-most support, potentially setting up Dahle for a November matchup with Newsom in a race the incumbent looks very likely to win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That poll also looked at the <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> primary and found Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla is in good shape to advance in both (yes, both) U.S. Senate races he’s running in. Padilla, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/election/article260863477.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whom Newsom appointed</a> to succeed Vice President Kamala Harris, <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/05/04/us-sen-alex-padilla-will-appear-on-californias-june-primary-ballot-twice-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will actually be on the ballot twice</a>: first in a special election for the final months of Padilla’s current term, then for the seat’s next six-year term beginning January 2023. He is heavily favored to win both.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A statewide race with a bit more intrigue is the <strong>attorney general</strong> election, which could present the best chance for a non-Democrat to win a California statewide office in years (Democrats <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/2022/04/california-republicans-convention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have won every partisan statewide election since 2010</a>). Democratic incumbent Rob Bonta, whom <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/2021/03/newsom-picks-rob-bonta-as-californias-new-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsom appointed</a> in 2021, is seeking a full term and appears on track to win. But with <a href="https://calmatters.org/newsletters/whatmatters/2022/02/california-crime-homelessness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters in California worried about crime</a>, Bonta’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/13/california-attorney-general-race-bonta-00011434" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive approach to criminal justice</a> in his previous role as a state legislator could present an opening for a more conservative alternative — albeit not necessarily a Republican. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Enter Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert, a former Republican running as an independent, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-19/california-attorney-general-election-anne-marie-schubert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whose profile</a> as a tough on crime but socially liberal district attorney <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-28/2022-california-primary-attorney-general-second-place" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could make her a desirable alternative</a> for liberal voters in California. Understandably then, Bonta would prefer to face one of the two Republicans running in the general election — attorneys Nathan Hochman and Eric Early — but <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/California-attorney-general-seeks-reelection-17192442.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should they split the GOP vote</a>, Schubert could finish second and meet Bonta in the general election. However, the little polling we have suggests the November contest will likely be a Democrat versus a Republican: The Los Angeles Times/UC Berkeley IGS poll found Bonta leading with 46 percent, followed by Early at 16 percent, Hochman at 12 percent and Schubert at 6 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s now turn to — gulp — the 16 primaries to watch for the U.S. House of Representatives on <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California’s new congressional map</a>. These include three Republican incumbents defending Democratic-leaning seats that <a href="https://dccc.org/dccc-announces-changes-to-2022-house-battlefield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats aim to capture</a> and four Democratic-leaning seats that are <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2022/03/30/nrcc-continues-to-expand-offensive-map-following-redistricting-developments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP targets in the fall</a> (three have Democratic incumbents). There are also three GOP-leaning seats with two Republican incumbents that could potentially be competitive in November, and six safe seats (one Republican, five Democratic) with notable primary action.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start with the three Republicans running in Democratic-leaning seats. First, Republican Rep. David Valadao is seeking reelection in California’s <strong>22nd District</strong>, a heavily Latino seat in the Central Valley. But despite the district’s D+10 lean, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the GOP-leaning national environment</a> and <a href="https://gvwire.com/2022/06/02/central-valley-politics-could-help-tilt-power-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valadao’s moderate reputation</a> could secure him a victory. Valadao will also face an easier primary than many expected last year, when he <a href="https://twitter.com/FresnoCountyGOP/status/1349790760556662784" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparked outrage among Republicans</a> by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting to impeach</a> then-President Donald Trump. But unlike <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-but-one-house-republican-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-faces-a-trump-endorsed-challenger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of his GOP compatriots</a> in the same situation, Valadao <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-23/david-valadao-california-primary-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never attracted</a> a high-profile Republican challenger. His strongest Republican foe is Chris Mathys, a former Fresno city councilman <a href="https://electionresults.sos.state.nm.us/resultsSW.aspx?type=FED&amp;map=CTY&amp;eid=2778" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who lost a primary</a> for a House seat in <em>New Mexico</em> in 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While we have no polling, the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=CA22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of involvement</a> by pro-Trump groups (and the man himself) suggests Mathys — who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA21183/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has loaned his campaign</a> more than $320,000 — has made little headway. However, two different outside groups have gotten involved late in the campaign. On Friday, the Congressional Leadership Fund, the principal GOP House-focused super PAC, launched <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/gop-super-pac-jumps-help-impeachment-republican-rcna31898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a roughly $250,000 ad buy</a> attacking Mathys as “liberal” and “soft on crime.” This came not long after the CLF’s Democratic counterpart, the House Majority PAC, <a href="https://www.thehousemajoritypac.com/news/house-majority-pac-launches-six-figure-ad-campaign-supporting-assemblymember-rudy-salas-in-ca-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began a $275,000 ad and mail campaign on behalf</a> of Assemblyman Rudy Salas, the only Democrat running. With low turnout expected and the potential for greater-than-expected backing for a further-right Republican alternative, Democrats probably want to make sure their candidate doesn’t finish third and lock the party out from competing for this blue-leaning seat in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile in the northern Los Angeles suburbs, the big question in the new <strong>27th District </strong>is whether Republican Rep. Mike Garcia will face former state Assemblywoman Christy Smith for the third straight time. Garcia defeated Smith in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/13/gop-wins-california-special-election-255630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2020 special election</a> for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-special-election-for-katie-hills-seat-will-test-democrats-strength-in-the-suburbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently vacated seat</a>, then beat her again that November <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2020-general/sov/24-us-reps.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by just 333 votes</a>. But a third rematch might not be in the cards as Smith also has to contend with fellow Democrat and Navy veteran Quaye Quartey, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/27/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has run even</a> with Smith in fundraising and actually entered the last weeks of the race with three times as much cash on hand. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Quartey <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-05-16/endorsement-christy-smith-for-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has endorsements</a> from the Congressional Black Caucus and VoteVets, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00418897/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which has spent</a> a little over $100,000 boosting Quartey. But Smith has endorsements from a number of California Democrats, suggesting something of a D.C.-California split over the best choice to defeat Garcia, who has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty conservative profile</a> despite representing a blue-leaning district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the Orange County-based <strong>45th District </strong>to the south, Rep. Michelle Steel is the last GOP House member running in a blue-leaning seat. The new district’s voting-age population is about 40 percent Asian, and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-04-29/michelle-steel-jay-chen-accusations-congressional-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the candidate field reflects this</a>. Steel, who is Korean American, faces fellow Republican and former Orange County Board of Education trustee Long Pham, who is Vietnamese American, and community college trustee Jay Chen, who is Taiwanese American and the lone Democrat in the race. It is Steel and Chen, though, who are likely to advance, as Pham’s attempt to run to Steel’s right looks like a long shot at this point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next up, the four primaries in blue-leaning but still likely very competitive seats. First, there’s Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, who is seeking reelection in the new <strong>47th District</strong>, also based in Orange County. Known for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rep-katie-porter-financial-services-committee-hearings-nobody-control-me-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her withering questioning in committee hearings</a>, Porter is one of the most impressive fundraisers in the House, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8CA45130/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having brought in</a> $15.2 million this cycle. But she may need to use much of that war chest to reintroduce herself, as she currently represents only about 40 percent of the new district’s constituents, which could make it challenging for her <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/05/26/house-update-9-races-move-toward-gop-only-1-the-other-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to win</a> a D+6 district in a Republican-leaning cycle. The GOP candidate most likely to advance is former state Assembly Minority Leader Scott Baugh, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA47196/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has raised</a> $1.5 million so far and whose background as a former chair of the Orange County GOP <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2022/04/21/elections-2022-get-to-know-rep-katie-porter-four-more-candidates-in-47th-district-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should make him a familiar face</a> to many Republicans in the district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the border of Orange and San Diego counties is the <strong>49th District</strong>, where Democratic Rep. Mike Levin is defending a D+5 seat. The leading GOP contender to move on with Levin may be former San Juan Capistrano Mayor Brian Maryott, who Levin defeated by 6 points in the 2020 election. But while Maryott <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8CA49108/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $1.2 million in contributions and loaned himself another $1 million, a Levin-Maryott rematch is far from certain. Maryott must contend with two other noteworthy Republicans: Oceanside City Councilman Christopher Rodriguez, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA49242/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $1.2 million ($100,000 from his own pocket), and Orange County Supervisor Lisa Bartlett, who has <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA49267/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought in</a> $489,000. Additionally, Rodriguez has also enjoyed more than a half million dollars in <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00668905/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside spending support from the American Patriots PAC</a>. The only poll we’ve seen was a <a href="https://www.kusi.com/poll-finds-christopher-rodriguez-leading-republican-candidates-in-49th-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey conducted by co/efficient</a> on behalf of Rodriguez’s campaign, which found Rodriguez running just ahead of Maryott and Bartlett, but the results were too close to say anything definitive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moving north, Democratic Rep. Josh Harder is running in the new<strong> 9th District</strong>, which sits in the Central Valley around the city of Stockton. The roughly D+8 seat contains only about a quarter of Harder’s current constituents, but Harder <a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/candidates-rep-josh-harder-vie-calif-congressional-district-seat/38810477#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to run here</a> after fellow Democratic Rep. Jerry McNerney announced his retirement in January. Harder doesn’t appear to have serious Democratic opposition, and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8CA10126/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s raised</a> $4.8 million to try to retain the seat in the face of midterm headwinds. The Republican most likely to join Harder in November is San Joaquin County Supervisor Tom Patti, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA09139/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $549,000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, there’s the seat Harder <a href="https://www.turlockjournal.com/news/government/harder-announces-campaign-new-cd-13-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially planned</a> to run in, the <strong>13th District</strong>, a D+7 seat that lies south of the 9th District. <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/election/article261534607.html#storylink=cpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The open-seat race has attracted</a> two notable candidates from each party. On the Democratic side, financial advisor Phil Arballo <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0CA22102/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $1.5 million, and is trying to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/california-22nd-house-district-election-devin-nunes-phil-arballo-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build off his failed 2020 campaign</a> against now-former Republican Rep. Devin Nunes. Arballo could also benefit from the district’s demographics (he is Latino seeking to represent a majority Latino district) and by running as the more progressive Democratic choice, which has <a href="https://www.seiu521.org/press-release/philaballoendorsed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned him the backing</a> of the California SEIU. That sets up a contrast with Assemblyman Adam Gray, who has a reputation as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-moderate-democrats-leadership-20170427-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the leading moderate Democrats</a> in Sacramento. But while Gray <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA13115/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> less money than Arballo, he <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-31/california-congressional-races-to-watch-in-the-june-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does have the official endorsement</a> of the California Democratic Party and major party leaders like Newsom and Padilla. Moreover, Gray’s also <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=CA13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received outside support</a> from business-friendly and centrist groups, including almost $250,000 in spending <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00083279/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by the California Association of Realtors</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Republican agribusinessman John Duarte and businessman David Giglio have run pretty close on fundraising, as Duarte <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA13131/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has brought in</a> nearly $800,000 to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA16134/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giglio’s $734,000</a>. But Duarte appears to be the national party’s preferred candidate, as he’s part of the National Republican Congressional Committee’s <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidate-type/young-gun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Young Guns program</a> and has benefited from $172,000 in spending on his behalf <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00504530/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the Congressional Leadership Fund</a>. But beyond the likely competitive general election it’ll set up, this top-two primary is worth monitoring because, with four serious candidates, it’s possible that one party’s pair of candidates narrowly finishes first and second, shutting out the other party from the general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next up, the trio of Republican-leaning House seats that could still see some serious competition in the fall. First, Republican Rep. Young Kim has decided to seek reelection in the new Orange County-based <strong>40th District</strong>, but she currently represents only 20 percent of the new district’s population. Physician Asif Mahmood, the only Democrat on the ballot, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/elections/article/An-odd-race-for-California-s-40th-District-17201717.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tried to capitalize</a> on that <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2022/05/23/elections-2022-democrat-asif-mahmood-focuses-on-abortion-but-not-young-kim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by running ads</a> that indirectly encourage Republicans to back Mission Viejo City Councilman Greg Raths, a Republican running to Kim’s right. Raths would likely be a much weaker opponent for Mahmood than Kim, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8CA39240/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who’s raised</a> $5.4 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA40084/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Rath’s</a> $136,000. But Republicans are taking this threat seriously as the Congressional Leadership Fund <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00504530/independent-expenditures/2022?t0-search=rath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped nearly</a> $450,000 in ads attacking Raths. Despite Mahmood’s efforts, the most likely outcome is a Kim-Mahmood faceoff in the general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, east of Los Angeles, the new <strong>41st District</strong> is an R+7 seat where two Democrats are jockeying to face 15-term Republican Rep. Ken Calvert in November. Former federal prosecutor Will Rollins <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA42205/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> just over $1 million to engineer <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA42197/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shrina Kurani’s</a> $491,000. We don’t have any recent public polls of this race, so it’s hard to know which Democrat will advance, but allies of Rollins at the Welcome PAC <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Pi640eQKDpNT17cTNvlNzl5GfTlEo-J/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did release a survey</a> three months ago from Tulchin Research that showed him running about even with Calvert in a hypothetical general election matchup. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the new <strong>3rd District</strong> is an open R+8 seat that runs from central to northern California along the Nevada border. Democrats have coalesced behind Navy veteran and physician Kermit Jones, so he’ll likely advance out of the primary with either one of two Republicans: Assemblyman Kevin Kiley or Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. Kiley may have the upper hand thanks to an <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/politics/kiley-jones-congressional-district-3-endorsement/103-cbdc2a46-13e7-42e1-9b63-4a14b3a5c38a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement from Trump</a> and his fundraising edge, as he’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA03157/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought in</a> $1.5 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA03140/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Jones’s</a> $510,000.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having covered the 10 primaries in competitive or potentially competitive House seats, we’ll wrap up with some rapid-fire coverage of six safe seats, as some of these races feature interesting intraparty divides. There’s just one safe Republican seat of note: the <strong>5th District</strong> in the northern Central Valley and lower Sierra Nevadas, where GOP Rep. Tom McClintock is running for reelection. This seat is a safe R+17, but because McClintock currently represents only 42 percent of this seat, it’s possible fellow Republican and Fresno County Supervisor Nathan Magsig could advance to November and unseat him. As of May 18, both men <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/05/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had about the same amount of money</a> on hand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, there are five safely blue seats where Democrats are duking it out. First up, two Democratic incumbents who could face a fair bit of opposition. In the <strong>8th District</strong>, Democratic Rep. John Garamendi has seemingly little-known opponents, but his new seat is deeply blue — D+50 — which is a stark change from the light blue district he’s held over the past decade. As a result, Garemendi’s <a href="https://voteview.com/person/20958/john-garamendi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate voting record</a> might be out of step here. So it wouldn’t be shocking to see the other three Democrats on the ballot pick up more than a little support, even if they don’t beat Garamendi. And in Los Angeles’s <strong>34th District</strong>, the primary will likely feature an all-Democratic rematch between Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez and immigration attorney David Kim. Gomez beat Kim <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2020-general/sov/24-us-reps.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 6 points</a> in the 2020 general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, there are three dark blue open seats where two Democrats will likely advance to the November election. First, the primary for the <strong>15th District</strong> on the southeastern end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the race to succeed Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier. This race features three major Democratic contenders in Assemblyman Kevin Mullin, San Mateo County Supervisor David Canepa and Burlingame Councilmember Emily Beach. Mullin <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/15/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has somewhat outraised</a> the others, but Beach, an Army veteran, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=CA15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has received</a> $169,000 in outside support from veteran-focused groups, and it’s hard to really suss out who has the upper hand. The Los Angeles-based <strong>37th District</strong> has a crowded field, but state Sen. Sydney Kamlager is the likely front-runner to succeed Rep. Karen Bass. Kamlager has endorsements from Bass and EMILY’s List, and has gotten close to $1 million <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=CA37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in outside spending support</a>, mostly from crypto-aligned groups. Lastly, in the <strong>42nd District</strong>, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia and Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (no relation) seem likely to advance to the general election. The former definitely <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA47188/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a fundraising advantage</a>, as he’s raised $1.1 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CA42213/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to her</a> $420,000. He’s <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=CA42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also garnered</a> $1.2 million in outside support from crypto-aligned groups, while the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s new super PAC has spent more than a half million dollars attacking the assemblywoman.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To close, there’s also a special election in the <strong>22nd District</strong> for the last few months of Republican Rep. Devin Nunes’s term, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/politics/devin-nunes-resigns-from-congress/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as he resigned in January</a> after redistricting obliterated his district. (The new 22nd district discussed earlier barely contains anything from this district.) <a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/upcoming-elections/2022-cd22/primary-official-canvass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No candidate won a majority</a> in the initial special election on April 5, which by California law necessitated a second round of voting. But as the GOP candidates won about two-thirds of the initial vote — much more than Trump’s 52 percent in 2020 — it seems likely that Republican Connie Conway, a former assemblywoman, will defeat Democrat Lourin Hubbard, a water resource manager, to serve out the last months of this district’s existence. Neither candidate is running for a seat on the new House map.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-reelection-2024/2021/11/20/0779469c-4947-11ec-95dc-5f2a96e00fa3_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says he’ll run for reelection in 2024</a>. But some Americans don’t believe him  — and moreover, many don’t want him to throw his hat into the ring for a second term. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even before <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden was elected in 2020</a>, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/biden-2024-democrats-search-for-alternative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s been speculation</a> about whether he’ll seek a second term. And a Wall Street Journal poll <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/half-of-americans-doubt-biden-will-run-in-2024-wsj-poll-shows-11647349654" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted from March 2-7</a> found that more than half (52 percent) of registered voters don’t think he’ll run again in 2024, while only 29 percent think he will run again. (Nineteen percent were unsure.) A second Biden run isn’t that popular, either. According to <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/a-year-after-inauguration-biden-faces-a-more-critical-and-pessimistic-public/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an AP/NORC poll</a> conducted from Jan. 13-18, 70 percent of Americans don’t want the president to run in 2024. Even Democrats are lukewarm about the idea. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-2024/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A CNN/SSRS poll</a> conducted from Jan. 10-Feb. 6 found that slightly more than half (51 percent) of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted a candidate other than Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of this might simply reflect that Americans are unenthusiastic about a redux of the 2020 election. In that AP/NORC poll, a similar share (72 percent) said they didn’t want former President Donald Trump to run for reelection either. It’s actually surprisingly common for voters to say they don’t want first-term presidents to seek a second term — to only then turn around and support them when they do run for reelection. However, the share of Americans who don’t want Biden to seek a second term is unusually high compared to previous first-term presidents. It’s also uncommon for voters to think that a sitting president won’t run for reelection. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s no question that concerns about Biden’s age could be playing a role. He’s already the oldest president in U.S. history and will be 81 by the time 2024 rolls around. But some voters might also think it’s time for Biden, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/politics/joe-biden-bridge-new-generation-of-leaders/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who pitched himself as a “bridge”</a> to a new generation of political leaders, to step aside in favor of a candidate who’s not an old, white man.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, though, it’s exceptionally rare for a first-term president to decide not to run for reelection. <a href="https://www.nas.org/blogs/article/ask_a_scholar_declining_the_second_term" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Only six presidents</a> have chosen to bow out after serving one full term. Four of those presidents had actually been in the White House for more than four years because they took over from former presidents who had died in office. The last president to deliberately call it quits after serving for four years was Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That explains why voters tend to (correctly) assume that presidents will run for a second term. At the end of 1982, a midterm year when President Ronald Reagan’s party <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/11/04/on-the-hill-republicans-either-lost-big-or-won-barely/cb12dcb9-b7d8-48ab-bde5-ddb53abf8c8d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost seats in Congress</a>, a majority of Americans nevertheless thought he would run again in 1984. Similarly, a Newsweek poll conducted in December 1994 found that 85 percent of Americans thought President Bill Clinton would run again in 1996, despite his party suffering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/1994-elections-congress-overview-gop-celebrates-its-sweep-power-clinton-vows.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive losses in that year’s midterm elections</a>. A Quinnipiac poll conducted in December 2018 also found that most Americans (81 percent) believed that Trump would run again in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether voters are actually <em>happy</em> about a first-term president running for reelection is an open question, though. A Harris poll conducted in August 1982 found that a majority (56 percent) of Americans thought Reagan shouldn’t run again. In December 1994, slightly more Americans thought Clinton shouldn’t run for reelection (47 percent) than thought he should (44 percent). But it’s not always the case that Americans don’t want a first-term president to run again. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in October 2010 found that more Americans said President Barack Obama should run for reelection (47 percent) than shouldn’t (42 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So in a sense, Biden’s case isn’t <em>that</em> unusual — or even that alarming for his supporters. It’s true that the share of Americans who don’t want him to run for reelection is much higher than it was for Reagan, Clinton or Obama. But unhappiness with a president running again doesn’t tell us much about their ultimate electoral chances if they do try for a second term. Despite voters’ misgivings two years earlier, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/07/politics/reagan-wins-by-a-landslide-sweeping-at-least-48-states-gop-gains.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reagan won by a wide margin in 1984</a>, as did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/us/clinton-elected-2d-term-with-solid-margins-across-us-gop-keeps-hold-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton in 1996</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there are a few reasons to think that Americans might view the prospect of a second Biden run differently than those of previous presidents. In that CNN/SSRS poll from earlier this year, 31 percent of Democrats who wanted the party to nominate someone else said they simply didn’t want Biden to be reelected, 35 percent thought he couldn’t win against the Republicans, and 19 percent said they thought he was too old. That level of skepticism from voters of a president’s own party is pretty abnormal — consider that a Suffolk poll of Republican primary voters conducted in April 2018 found that most (70 percent) wanted Trump to run again. In other words, the fact that so many Democrats have concerns about Biden is perhaps worrying for him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s age has also been a problem for voters that has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/17/joe-biden-doesnt-mind-if-you-think-hes-too-old-take-trump-fellow-septuagenarian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hovered in the background</a> for years. If he’s elected to a second term, he’ll be 86 when he leaves office — nearly a decade older than Reagan, who had previously been America’s oldest president at 77. In 2020, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/perceptions-of-trump-and-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Pew Research Center poll found</a> that 31 percent of registered voters who supported Biden were concerned about his age and health. There’s evidence, too, that Americans generally <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-bidens-opponents-being-too-coy-in-making-age-an-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have reservations</a> about electing a candidate of advanced age. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/01/19/elected-officials-maximum-age-limit-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A YouGov poll conducted in January</a>, for instance, found that 58 percent of Americans support a maximum age limit for elected officials. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also possible that something else is going on: Some Americans might want Biden to step aside in favor of someone else. Perhaps they’d prefer someone who better represents the party’s growing diversity, or someone who is perceived as having a better shot at defeating the Republican nominee in 2024. After all, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval ratings are low</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/01/1095466871/biden-polls-democrats-gen-z-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his support has eroded</a> among <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/democrats-biden-black-voters-midterms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">young voters, Latinos, and Black voters</a> in particular. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-have-been-souring-on-biden-since-last-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Those voters might be dissatisfied</a> with Biden’s inability to deliver on the sweeping promises he made at the beginning of his term. Or they might just be afraid he can’t win.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the economy, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393176/economic-pessimism-growing.aspx">according to a new report from Gallup</a>. In May, Gallup’s economic confidence index — a metric that summarizes how Americans are feeling about the economy on a scale from 100 to -100 — came in at -45, down from -39 in the previous two months. It’s likely the lowest that Americans’ confidence in the economy has been since the Great Recession.</li><li>Just in time for Pride Month, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393197/same-sex-marriage-support-inches-new-high.aspx">a Gallup survey</a> conducted from May 2-22 found that 71 percent of Americans support legal same-sex marriage. That’s not a noticeable change from last year when 70 percent of Americans said they supported same-sex marriage, but Gallup’s trend is a reminder of how much public opinion on this issue has shifted over the past two decades. In 2004, less than half (42 percent) of Americans supported same-sex marriage. And ten years ago, in 2012, support was hovering right around 50 percent.</li><li>Following <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473">the leak of a Supreme Court opinion</a> that suggested five justices may be willing to overturn Roe v. Wade, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/upholding-roe-v-wade-is-supported-by-most-americans-wsj-poll-finds-11654162200">a Wall Street Journal/NORC poll</a> conducted from May 9-17 found that Americans remain firmly opposed to the move. Two-thirds (68 percent) of Americans said they would not like to see the court overturn Roe, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973, while 30 percent said they would like to see that outcome. The poll also found that the share of Americans who say a woman should be able to have an abortion for any reason (57 percent) is at its highest point since NORC began asking the question in 1977.</li><li>Should kids be required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in schools each day? <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/philosophy/survey-results/daily/2022/06/02/d8746/1">A YouGov poll</a> conducted on June 2 found that a majority (52 percent) of Americans think so, while 33 percent say they shouldn’t be required to say the Pledge of Allegiance, and 15 percent said they’re not sure.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">A metal coat hanger can’t speak, but it can send a message. Long a symbol of the dangers faced by people seeking to end pregnancies in the years before Roe v. Wade, coat hangers stand in for a whole inventory of physical horrors, most of which never involved coat hangers, specifically. Over the past few weeks, protesters have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral/people-are-sending-coat-hangers-supreme-court-tiktok-abortion-protest-rcna27195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailed hangers to the Supreme Court</a> in an effort to evoke that past era — from the so-called back-alley butchers who botched surgical procedures and sexually harassed patients, to the terrible lengths individuals went through to give themselves an abortion at home. The message is simple and brutal: Without safe and legal abortion, the protesters believe, people will die. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the years since Roe became the law of the land, the medical landscape of abortion has changed drastically. Today, abortion is extremely safe — <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7009a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safer than birth</a>. So safe, in fact, that it’s not always obvious what made illegal abortions unsafe. Or, for that matter, what the coat hangers were <em>for</em>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this is why those objects still have important stories to tell us, historians told me. Because while the most physically violent abortion methods of the past have become medically obsolete, the march of scientific progress hasn’t eliminated the shame, fear and hopelessness experienced by people who are pregnant, don’t want to be, and live in a society where there is no simple, legal access to abortion. Coat hangers don’t just tell us about the dangers of bad medicine, practiced shoddily, these historians said. Instead, the hangers also speak volumes about the desperation that can lead people to those dangerous procedures in the first place. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">“The whole phrase ‘back-alley butcher’ is an exaggeration because there were lots of good practitioners who were perfectly safe,” said Leslie J. Reagan, professor of history at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and author of “When Abortion Was a Crime.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even in the past, the dangers of illegal abortion weren’t about the abortion itself. No one knows how many illegal abortions were being performed annually, pre-Roe, but researchers in the early 1990s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12317573/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated it was on par with annual numbers of legal abortions at the time</a>, so more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00038049.htm#:~:text=Results%3A%20In%201991%2C%201%2C388%2C937%20abortions,15-44%20years%20of%20age." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 million</a>. People with money and connections could always get safe ones and plenty of people survived, the historians I spoke with said. Illegal abortions were primarily unsafe for the people who were blocked out of better options.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Legal abortions in hospitals, for example, happened with some regularity. These records were kept hospital by hospital, so it’s rare to have even city-wide data, but University of Vermont historian Felicia Kornbluh pointed me towards <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1256364/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 1965 paper that found hospital review boards in New York City had approved 4,703 so-called therapeutic abortions</a> between 1951 and 1962.  In those cases, the technique actually being used was something called a dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C. Also often referred to as a “surgical abortion” the D&amp;C is still used today as a treatment for both abortion and miscarriage. Doctors dilate the cervix — making the opening between the vagina and uterus wider — and use a sharp tool to scrape out the contents of the uterus.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before Roe, in the 1950s and 60s, getting a legal hospital abortion was not easy. A patient could get a D&amp;C if they were already experiencing a natural miscarriage. Otherwise, patients who requested one would have to make a case to their doctors, who would then have to bring the situation before a hospital review board. The patient would likely be examined by other doctors and might have to answer questions — basically, they needed to prove the abortion was medically or psychologically necessary. But necessity wasn’t the only factor at play. “There are studies that show that almost all of them were done on people with private insurance,” Reagan said. Patients without insurance, as well as black and brown patients regardless of insurance status, had a much harder time getting approved. In her upcoming book, “A Woman’s Life is a Human Life,” Kornbluh records that Metropolitan Hospital in East Harlem approved five white women’s requests for every one Black woman’s. The hospital was even less likely to approve Puerto Rican women’s requests. And Reagan has documented instances of Black women being denied abortions even though they had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/pregnancy.html#:~:text=Pregnant%20women%20who%20contract%20rubella,Deafness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rubella infections during pregnancy</a> — something that can kill a fetus, or leave it with lifelong complications, including deafness, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. (Others were lied to and told they didn’t have it.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><br>People who were denied — or who never had a hope of getting — a hospital abortion were left with only illegal options. Both trained doctors and untrained practitioners offered D&amp;C’s, but that procedure was considerably more dangerous in illegal settings. Without sterilized equipment and ready access to antibiotics and painkillers, doctors used furtive practices that optimized for speed and offered no room for follow-up care, and practitioners sometimes had no idea what they were doing. Carole Joffe, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, interviewed trained doctors who practiced illegal abortion during this time and has written about their experiences. One doctor told her that he used to explain the challenges of performing a D&amp;C by telling his residents that it was like being blindfolded and trying to scrape the inside of a wet paper bag without cutting through the paper. Possible, but not easy. “D&amp;C’s in competent hands are safe, but in incompetent hands it’s very easy to perforate the uterus,” Joffe said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To avoid trying to perform the tricky D&amp;C under clandestine circumstances, illegal abortionists sometimes opted instead to simply induce enough of a miscarriage that their patient could go to a hospital and get one without a problem. They did this often by inserting a foreign object — like a hollow tube catheter — through the cervix. In some cases, they might use a type of catheter with a balloon on one end. Filled with saline, it would put pressure on the cervix, like a fetus’s head would towards the end of pregnancy, causing it to fully dilate. Just sticking any catheter in could prompt a miscarriage as the body tried to expel the object. <a href="https://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/Citation/1952/10000/A_CASE_OF_ATTEMPTED_CRIMINAL_ABORTION_WITH.62.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These methods didn’t work all the time</a>, though. They could cause hemorrhages and embolisms. And catheters had to be left in for a while, along with gauze packed into the patient’s vagina to staunch the blood. <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Roe-Report-Part-I-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This could cause infection</a> and with patients trying to hide from authorities, they often didn’t seek treatment until near death.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">People who couldn’t find or afford an illegal abortion often tried to give one to themselves. It’s impossible to say how many of these happened every year, but there are records showing thousands of people coming into emergency rooms with septic infections of the uterus and reproductive organs in the 1960s, Reagan said. This is where the coat hangers come in, Joffe said, as one of many objects people would try to insert through their own cervical openings. The goal was not necessarily to complete an abortion at home but rather to induce enough bleeding and symptoms of miscarriage that the person could go to a hospital, say they were having a miscarriage naturally, and get a hospital D&amp;C. But perforation, hemorrhage, and infection were all risks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even less reliable, and more dangerous, were an array of suppositories, tinctures, herbs and home remedies that plenty of people tried. One doctor told Joffe about treating a patient who had gotten a catheter into her cervix and poured turpentine through it, literally cooking the inside of her uterus, which had to be removed. Others told stories about potassium permanganate tablets, sold over the counter, which people would put in their vaginas to induce bleeding and get their hospital D&amp;C. But the tablets could easily eat through the vaginal lining, causing hemorrhage and destroying the cervix. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s very unlikely that anyone will go back to performing back-alley D&amp;Cs or catheter abortions, Reagan and Joffe said. Even if Roe is overturned, doctors and other people who want to defy it are much more likely to offer patients abortion pills. While <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-can-expect-if-abortion-pills-become-their-only-safe-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion via pill can be a physically painful and psychologically intense experience</a> for some people, the existence of these pills drastically changes the calculus when it comes to the risks of illegal abortion. They’re much easier to get and conceal, much safer to use, and if a patient is worried about side effects they can seek treatment knowing no one will be able to tell the difference between the effects of a pill and a natural miscarriage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But both Reagan and Joffe said the existence of abortion pills won’t eliminate risk if abortion becomes illegal. Just as there were some people who could get abortions more easily than others before Roe, there will be those who can do so after, as well. Meanwhile, some of the most vulnerable people — poor people, people living in very rural areas, people who can’t take time off to drive to another state in search of pills — will still end up with only desperate options left. Reagan was particularly worried that websites selling fake abortion pills will deceive people who have no idea they aren’t getting the real thing. And both she and Joffe worried about how illegality and increased stigma could drive more people towards dangerous at-home methods, with social media becoming the new back alley. Even with abortion still legal, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/23/10656860/coat-hanger-abortion-pregnancy-murder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are occasional instances of people</a> — usually young — trying to abort on their own, Reagan said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The methodology of abortion has improved, Reagan and Joffee told me. But as long as desperation for an abortion exists — and easy access does not — some people will still be in danger. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>The following is an updated version of </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/school-shootings-are-still-rare-and-that-makes-them-hard-to-stop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>this article</em></a><em>, published in 2018.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The horror in Uvalde, Texas, last week was horrifyingly familiar to Mary Ellen O’Toole. Part of a small group of academics, law-enforcement professionals and psychologists who published some of the first research on mass shootings in schools more than 20 years ago, O’Toole knows the patterns these events and perpetrators all follow — and the opportunities for prevention that seem to just keep being missed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I first spoke to her in 2018, after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, but she has been studying school shootings for more than 27 years. In that time, she and other experts say little has changed. The risk factors they identified two decades ago still apply. The recommendations they made are still valid. And every time another batch of Americans die in this way, researchers like O’Toole are forced to watch in horror, thinking about what could have been prevented and why it wasn’t.<br><br>“Honestly, I … I feel very, very angry,” O’Toole said to me last week. There is always another new example of mass gun violence in America. But mass gun violence in America is no longer new — and neither are efforts to stop it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"> “On the news, people are saying we should be concerned about this and that,” O’Toole told me in 2018, “and I thought, ‘We identified that 20 years ago. Did you not read this stuff 20 years ago?’ … It’s fatiguing. I just feel a sense of fatigue.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s difficult to say definitively how many school shootings have happened in this country — different databases count them in different ways and come up with different numbers of incidents. It’s harder still to prove how many would-be shootings were averted, or how many others could have been if additional steps had been taken. But the people who have spent more than two decades trying to understand this phenomenon are still here and are still trying to sell politicians and the public on possible solutions that are complicated, expensive and tough to sum up in a sound bite.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Any research into school shootings is made more difficult by how uncommon such shootings are. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight wrote about the more than <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33,000 people killed by guns in America</a> every year. Of those deaths, roughly one-third — about 12,000 — were homicides, but hardly any were due to mass shootings.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data on total gun deaths and gun homicides was drawn from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and represents the average of the years 2012-2014. There is not a single definition of what constitutes a mass shooting. To count those, we chose to use the definition and database put together by &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt;, because it was recommended by experts I spoke to at the time and because it does a good job of distinguishing between a mass shooting as we understand it in the colloquial/pop-culture sense and other kinds of shootings that, while tragic, don’t fit the narrative we’re trying to focus on here. But there is no one right answer for how to quantify this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you define mass shootings</a> as an event where a lone attacker indiscriminately kills four or more people, in a public place, unrelated gang activity or robbery, then mass shootings account for a tiny portion of all gun homicides — probably a fraction of a percent. School shootings are an even smaller subset</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 1995, when O’Toole began to study school shootings, they seemed like even more of an outlier than they are today. “I couldn’t even call it a phenomenon,” she said in 2018. “Prior to Columbine, there was no indication that it was going to become one of those crimes that just becomes part of the culture. It looked like it could have faded away.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These uncommon but high-profile tragedies had also drawn the attention of Marisa Randazzo. In 1999, she was the chief psychologist for the Secret Service and became a part of a joint effort between the Secret Service and Department of Education to better understand school shooters and how to prevent attacks before they happened. Randazzo had previously worked on <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Photocopy/167224NCJRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Exceptional Case Study Project</a> — a Secret Service project designed to better understand people who threaten the president and other public figures. Like school shootings, assassinations are extremely rare events that have a huge impact on society. That rarity makes them hard to study — and makes it hard to tell blowhards from real threats. But their impact makes them important to understand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Randazzo found that the project’s findings echoed what she was learning about school shootings. For instance, the Secret Service had once focused its energy on threats made by people with a history of violent crime or who had a mental illness that caused them to act irrationally. But the Exceptional Case Study Project analysis showed that most people who actually carry out attacks didn’t meet either of those criteria. Instead, a better way to figure out who was really a threat was to talk to friends, family and coworkers — most attackers had discussed their plans with other people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Randazzo</a>’s and <a href="http://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/safety/fbi-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O’Toole’s</a> parallel reports came to remarkably similar conclusions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, these studies determined that there wasn’t much point in trying to profile school shooters. Yes, most were (and remain) male and white, but those categories were so broad that they’re essentially useless in identifying potential threats ahead of time, Randazzo said. What’s more, she said, more detailed profiles risked stigmatizing perfectly reasonable behaviors — like wearing black and listening to loud music.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, the reports focused on the behavior and mental state of the young people who chose to kill. While these teens were deeply troubled, that’s not quite the same thing as saying that those who commit school shootings are just irredeemably mentally ill. Nor does it mean those young people suddenly snapped, giving no warning. “School shooters typically do this out of a profound adolescent crisis,” said James Garbarino, a professor of psychology at Loyola University Chicago who specializes in teen violence and began studying school shooters in the late 1990s.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Randazzo described a pattern of young people who were deeply depressed, unable to cope with their lives, who saw no other way out of a bad situation. The stressors they faced wouldn’t necessarily be problems that an adult would see as especially traumatic, but these young people were unable to handle their emotions, sadness and anger, and they started acting in ways that were, essentially, suicidal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of the best data on the mental state of school shooters has come from interviews with those shooters (and would-be shooters) who survived the attack. Randazzo described one such living school shooter,<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randazzo declined to say who she was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> currently serving multiple life sentences, who told her that before the attack he spent weeks vacillating between suicide and homicide. Only after he tried and failed to kill himself did he settle on killing others in hopes that someone would kill him. Garbarino, who has interviewed dozens of people who went to prison for life as teenagers, both for school shootings and other violent crimes, heard many similar stories.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The reason I emphasize this is that we know so much about how to help someone who is suicidal, and those same resources can be used very effectively with someone who is planning to engage in school violence,” Randazzo said. So how do we spot the ones who are planning an attack at a school? The studies she and O’Toole published years ago showed that, like people planning to attack the president, would-be school shooters don’t keep their plans to themselves. They tell friends or even teachers that they want to kill. They talk about their anger and their suicidality. They lash out violently against family and friends. And as more teens have attacked their schoolmates, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-florida-shooting-research-20180216-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that pattern has proved to hold true over time</a>. It was true for Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland shooter. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-yorks-red-flag-law-helped-thwart-buffalo-mass-shooting-went-wrong-rcna29054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It was true for Payton Gendron</a>, the Buffalo shooter. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/28/uvalde-texas-gunman-online-threats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It was true for Salvador Ramos</a>, the Robb Elementary shooter. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While all the experts I spoke with said that policies that keep guns out of the hands of teenagers are an important part of preventing mass shootings, they all also said it is crucial to set up systems that spot teens who are struggling and may become dangerous. You can’t predict violent events or who will go from threatening behavior to murder, O’Toole said. But it is possible for us to look around and see the people who are having problems and need intervention. Interventions can prevent violence, even if we can’t predict it, she told me. For example, at least four potential school shootings that were averted in the weeks after Parkland all stopped because the would-be killers spoke or wrote about their plans and someone told law enforcement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And there’s usually time to spot these things coming. While homicides in general are almost never premeditated, mass shootings — including school shootings — almost always are, said Adam Lankford, a professor of criminology at the University of Alabama. That makes sense, O’Toole said, because it takes time for a person who is drowning in self-pity and anger to decide their misery is someone else’s fault, to dehumanize those other people to the point of being able to kill them and to isolate themselves from any reality checks that could break through these dangerous thought patterns.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But time also erodes the systems that schools have implemented in the past to prevent violence. Randazzo told me that her team had trained numerous school districts in school shooting prevention back in the early 2000s and that, as of 2018, many of those districts no longer had prevention systems in place. Thanks to staff turnover and budget reprioritization, such institutional knowledge simply withered away. And ironically, that happens precisely <em>because</em> school shootings are so rare. “It takes time and effort for a school to create a team and get training,” Randazzo said. “And, fortunately, threatening behavior doesn’t happen often enough” to spur schools to action.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ views on abortion have been <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively consistent</a> for years despite massive demographic changes, social upheaval and shifting perspectives on sexuality. But that may be about to change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A new <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americans-views-on-whether-and-in-what-circumstances-abortion-should-be-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from the Pew Research Center</a> found that support for abortion rights is considerably higher among young Americans. Roughly three-quarters of 18- to 29-year-olds say abortion should generally be legal, including 30 percent who say it should be legal in all cases. Meanwhile, Americans 65 and older expressed much more tepid support — only 54 percent said abortion should be legal without exception (14 percent) or with some exceptions (40 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This might not sound all that surprising since younger adults often <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/26/key-findings-how-americans-attitudes-about-climate-change-differ-by-generation-party-and-other-factors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see issues</a> differently from older adults, but this age gap on attitudes about abortion contradicts past polling on this issue. According to the <a href="http://www3.norc.org/GSS+Website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Social Survey</a>,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GSS is conducted by the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, with funding from the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> young Americans’ views on obtaining an abortion have not been appreciably different from the public’s overall for much of the past 40-plus years. That changed fairly recently, though. On the question of whether someone should be able to get an abortion for any reason, 64 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds agreed in 2021, a 20-percentage-point increase from a decade earlier.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In fact, over the past decade, one of the most confounding trends in public opinion has been why millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996)<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our analyses throughout this article, we used the generational categories &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;outlined by the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. When we refer to “young Americans” or “young adults” as those ages 18 to 29, we will specify that, as 26- to 29-year-olds are technically millennials per Pew’s definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>21</sup></a> — who are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/millennials-are-leaving-religion-and-not-coming-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less religious</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/02/14/millennial-life-how-young-adulthood-today-compares-with-prior-generations-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more educated</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/the-liberal-millennial-revolution/470826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal</a> than previous generations — are not stronger supporters of abortion rights. <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls</a> have generally shown that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/01/4-race-immigration-same-sex-marriage-abortion-global-warming-gun-policy-marijuana-legalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millennials</a> express considerable <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/07/01/137079714/poll-generation-y-supports-gay-marriage-but-is-divided-on-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambivalence about abortion</a>, views that do not distinguish them from the broader public. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Millennials’ attitudes on abortion rights stand in stark relief to the way they tend to approach other issues of sex and sexuality. For instance, they were among the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2013/03/20/growing-support-for-gay-marriage-changed-minds-and-changing-demographics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest proponents</a> of legalizing same-sex marriage at the height of debate in the mid-2000s, and they have generally liberal views on <a href="https://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PRRI-Millennials-Web-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contraception, sex education</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25940736/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">premarital sex</a>. Abortion has always been the exception.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of focus groups</a> that my colleagues and I conducted in 2011,<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted four focus groups among 36 politically moderate white 18- to 29-year-olds in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, area. Groups were separated by gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> the contrast between millennials’ attitudes on abortion and same-sex marriage was clear. When they were asked to write down the first words that came to mind when they heard the term “same-sex marriage,” millennials’ responses were overwhelmingly positive — even celebratory. “Awesome,” “It’s cool!” and “Go for it!” were some of the phrases they shared, and the ensuing conversation was incredibly upbeat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The mood was dramatically different when discussing abortion, though. It was often difficult to get participants to maintain eye contact during the conversation, and their responses were largely negative: They said abortion was a sad situation and mentioned death or irresponsible behavior.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Scholars proposed a variety of theories to explain millennials’ curiously conservative views. It was suggested, for example, that the rise in sharing ultrasound images on social media may have led more young adults to think of a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/pro-life-pro-science/549308/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fetus as a growing child</a>, thus accounting for their greater reservations about abortions. Another popular explanation was that millennials were influenced by how abortion was <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Understanding_Public_Opinion/r_jd0nzKTvMC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=millennials+abortion+Juno+popular+culture&amp;pg=PT212&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrayed in popular culture</a> at the time, including in movies such as 2007’s “Juno” and “Knocked Up.” Demographic explanations have also featured prominently, as Latinos, who tend to be <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latino-millennials-are-more-conservative-abortion-n330921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more conservative</a> on abortion than other racial or ethnic groups, constitute a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-jan_brookings-metro_millennials-a-demographic-bridge-to-americas-diverse-future.pdf#page=6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger share</a> of millennials compared with older generations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, though, we’re left to solve another riddle: Why do Generation Z adults (born between 1997 and 2004) not share millennials’ more conservative perspectives on abortion? There are a few possible explanations worth considering.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps the simplest is that Gen Z adults, particularly women, are <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/featured_data/the-growing-political-divide-between-young-men-and-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal than previous generations</a> when they were young adults — including millennials. While younger adults are typically more liberal than older ones, Gen Z women especially tend to be progressive. An <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/march-2022-aps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis of Gallup surveys over the past decade</a> conducted by the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life, which I lead, found a critical shift in political identity among young women. In 2021, we found that 44 percent of 18- to 29-year-old women <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/featured_data/the-growing-political-divide-between-young-men-and-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified as liberal</a>, whereas only 30 percent of 18- to 29-year-old women identified as such a decade earlier. Among men in this age group, the share who identified as liberal was essentially unchanged during the same time period.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another explanation is that for most Gen Z Americans, abortion is not an issue wound up in ethical, moral and religious concerns, as it more often is for many other Americans. Pew’s March survey suggests that most Gen Z Americans aren’t thinking about abortion with the same moral framing: Only 32 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said abortion was morally wrong in all or most cases compared with 47 percent of 30- to 49-year-olds and 53 percent of Americans age 50 or older. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible that growing diversity among Gen Zers along lines of race, religion and, most notably, sexuality has also led them to eschew the standards of morality that previous generations embrace. It’s true that millennials are also a fairly diverse group, but Gen Zers are unique in their approach to sexuality and feelings of physical attraction. For instance, a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/gender-identity-and-sexual-orientation-differences-generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 Ipsos survey</a> found that Gen Zers are significantly less likely than millennials to be attracted exclusively to the opposite sex. And compared with older generations, Gen Zers (as well as millennials) are more likely to agree that greater <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial and ethnic diversity is good for society</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The waning influence of organized religion may offer another clue as to why Gen Z supports abortion rights more than other generations. According to the Survey Center on American Life, Gen Zers had somewhat <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/generation-z-future-of-faith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weaker formative attachments</a> to religion than millennials did. Fifteen percent of Gen Zers said they were raised in nonreligious households, and even those raised in a religious tradition reported having less regular involvement with their faith. As a result, it’s likely that compared with older generations, Gen Zers are just less familiar with religiously based objections to abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s important to remember, too, that Gen Zers are coming of age at a time when America’s religious identity and moral authority are more contested and its institutions less trusted. Consider, for example, how much confidence in organized religion has plummeted in the past decade. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Gallup</a>, only 37 percent of Americans said they had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the church or organized religion in 2021. But in the mid-2000s, when millennials were roughly the same age as Gen Zers are now, a greater share of Americans expressed confidence in religious institutions. In other words, not only are Gen Zers less rooted in religious communities, but religiously based arguments about abortion may hold less weight for them than they did for millennials because those in Gen Z do not trust the messengers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young adults today are also being told that the pathway to happiness and success lies in getting a good education and career. In fact, growing up, Gen Zers were more likely than previous generations to say it was <a href="https://storylines.substack.com/p/in-seeking-to-stand-out-gen-z-has?s=w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected that they would go to college</a>. Sixty percent of Gen Zers said their parents expected them to attend a four-year college compared with 48 percent of millennials, 43 percent of Gen Xers and 35 percent of baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recently, I wrote that Gen Zers are distinct from previous generations in their belief that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-most-accomplished-loneliest-generation-blame-parents-fault-2022-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional and educational achievements are critical</a> markers of their identity. Given the central importance of education, personal growth and fulfillment for this generation, it’s possible that support for abortion rights is rooted in the idea that an unplanned pregnancy might undermine these aspirations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, a crucial difference between Gen Z and millennials on abortion rights may have to do with shifting perceptions of access. Millennials came of age at a time when abortion was perceived as generally available and subject to comparatively few restrictions. In a <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2011 survey</a>, a majority (55 percent) of millennials said it was not at all or not too difficult to get an abortion, a significantly higher share compared with other age groups’ responses. After <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/states-arent-waiting-for-the-supreme-court-to-rule-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a decade of state-level restrictions</a>, though, and well-publicized efforts to reduce abortion access, views have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-may-be-mobilizing-more-democratic-voters-than-republicans-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed significantly</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, research has long shown that younger Americans are generally <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-younger-americans-dont-vote-more-often-no-its-not-apathy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less engaged</a> in politics and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/04/26/10-political-engagement-knowledge-and-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend less time</a> talking about political issues than older Americans. But abortion may be an issue they care about more. According to results from Pew’s March survey, younger Americans spend as much time as Americans overall thinking about abortion, and for young women, the share is even higher. If the Supreme Court does overturn Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973, it is not difficult to believe that the large majority of Gen Zers who support abortion rights will see such a move as an infringement on rights once afforded to them. And if the past few years have shown us anything, it is that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/white-working-class-trump-cultural-anxiety/525771/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety is a powerful political motivator</a>.</p>]]></description>
