<p data-paragraph="main">Election Day is Tuesday, and the latest polling shows Republican Glenn Youngkin with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a small lead</a> over Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia’s gubernatorial race. If Youngkin wins, he will be the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Governor_of_Virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Republican elected governor there in 12 years</a>.</p>

<h2>Is Virginia truly a blue state?</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday’s main event will happen in Virginia, where Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin are vying to be the commonwealth’s next governor. And the race is pretty much tied, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Virginia polling average</a>, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if either candidate comes out on top.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1766" height="1234" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">On one hand, the competitiveness of the race is a bit surprising as Virginia has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaned Democratic in recent years.</a> It <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for President Biden by 10 points in 2020</a>, and it has elected a Democrat in every statewide election dating back to 2012.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President and U.S. Senate in 2012; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2013; U.S. Senate in 2014; president in 2016; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2017; U.S. Senate in 2018; and president and U.S. Senate in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> But on the other hand, this D+5 state, according to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean</a>,<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> is still very susceptible to shifts in the national environment. And thanks to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular Democratic president in the White House</a>, the electoral environment currently favors the GOP. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Headed into the election, Biden’s approval rating sits at about 43 percent and his disapproval rating at about 51 percent, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> It’s underwater in Virginia, too. Recent polls from <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2021/10_26_2021_marginals.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=C18DD5B48B481336D2DC949F917376F13E0F8BE2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today/Suffolk University</a>, <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-24-27_Virginia_Topline_October-28-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/29/virginia-governors-race-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post/Schar School</a> found Biden’s approval rating in the mid-to-low 40s. This may galvanize Republicans — who were already more likely to show up at the polls <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in reaction to having a Democratic president</a> — while also potentially <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/18/biden-approval-rating-virginia-gubernatorial-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repelling some independents</a> who backed Biden last November. It’s also dampened enthusiasm among Democrats. <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2021-10-27.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The final poll</a> from Christopher Newport University’s Wason Center found that 80 percent of Republicans were “very enthusiastic” about voting, compared with just 65 percent of Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this is hardly new territory for McAuliffe. He was in the same position in 2013 when another unpopular Democratic president, Barack Obama, was in the White House. Obama’s approval numbers were nearly identical to Biden’s right now, yet McAuliffe <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2013&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still managed to win</a>. In fact, McAuliffe’s victory <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-surprisingly-dramatic-terry-ken-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked the first for the president’s party</a> in a Virginia gubernatorial race since the GOP won in 1973, during Richard Nixon’s presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thanks to Virginia’s one-term limit for elected governors, McAuliffe wasn’t able to seek reelection in 2017, but it’s plausible that McAuliffe should be in an even stronger position this time around, as <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2018-02-07.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he left office popular</a>. Virginia is also <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Democratic-leaning now</a> than it was in 2013. Yet Youngkin looks more formidable than McAuliffe’s 2013 foe, then-state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2013/11/06/terry-mcauliffe-three-reasons-why-he-is-the-new-governor-elect-of-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy to cast as a right-wing ideologue</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-trounces-cuccinelli-in-late-donations-in-virginia-governors-race/2013/10/31/f0749b7a-423a-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couldn’t keep pace with McAuliffe</a> in fundraising. Youngkin, meanwhile, is leaning into his appeal as an outsider — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/virginia-republicans-just-gave-themselves-a-chance-to-win-back-the-governorship/2021/05/11/574c545a-b281-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s never run for office before</a> — and <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/amount-raised-statewide-candidates-oct-25-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s kept up</a> with McAuliffe in fundraising, thanks in part to self-funding from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governors-race-financial-disclosures/2021/07/01/b697b70e-da9c-11eb-9bbb-37c30dcf9363_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immense personal wealth</a> he accrued <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/glenn-youngkin-fortune-carlyle-virginia/2021/08/02/aeeebab4-efc5-11eb-81d2-ffae0f931b8f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the finance industry</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Youngkin has also homed in on education in an attempt <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/22/virginia-governor-youngkin-education-gop-516625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to capitalize on</a> debates over <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how race is taught in schools</a>. His campaign has <a href="https://youtu.be/zafXDPCDsTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run ads criticizing McAuliffe</a> for saying in a recent debate that he didn’t “think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” McAuliffe was defending his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-vetoes-bill-that-would-have-allowed-parents-to-block-sexually-explicit-books-in-school/2016/04/04/8b969316-fa75-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 veto of legislation</a> that would have allowed parents to have their children “opt out” from reading school books with sexually explicit content, but McAuliffe is clearly concerned about Youngkin’s line of attack, as he’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaaavis/status/1450199344863399939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countered with his own ad</a> in which he says he’s “always valued the concerns of parents.” But in an effort not to give McAuliffe the final word on the matter, Youngkin closed his campaign with <a href="https://theweek.com/book-list/1006408/virginia-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-glenn-youngkin-runs-attack-ad-against-toni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ad featuring a woman criticizing</a> McAuliffe’s veto because her son had to read an explicit book in a college-level high school English course. (The ad doesn’t mention the title, but it was Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer-Prize-winning “Beloved,” a novel dealing with the horrors of slavery.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This could pay off for Youngkin, too, as USA Today/Suffolk found that 50 percent of likely voters thought parents should have more influence on school curricula than school boards, while 39 percent said school boards should have more influence. Fox News’s recent poll also found likely voters trusted Youngkin more on education, a shift from <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-10-13_Virginia_Topline_October-14-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two weeks earlier when its poll found</a> McAuliffe narrowly ahead on the issue, while the Washington Post/Schar School survey found the candidates running even on the issue even though voters had previously trusted McAuliffe more than Youngkin in their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-post-schar-poll/2021/09/17/11c4d042-164f-11ec-a5e5-ceecb895922f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early September poll</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, McAuliffe has continued to score better on COVID-19. Virginians are <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_VA_092721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to support vaccine requirements</a> for professions such as teachers and health care workers, and in most polls have said McAuliffe <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_va_102021.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would handle the pandemic best</a>. However, The Washington Post/Schar School’s final survey suggested — to Youngkin’s potential benefit — that the coronavirus has become a less pressing issue since September, as education and the economy clearly led the way as the top issues for likely voters, while the pandemic faded to a distant third.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But McAuliffe isn’t just campaigning on the pandemic; one of his chief approaches has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/virginiagovernortrumptake/2021/10/23/a1975068-340f-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to link Youngkin to former President Trump</a> to motivate Democrats and keep independent voters at an arm’s length from Youngkin. McAuliffe has played up <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-election-ef10f05ada241421ed40e1d1fbf355cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement of Youngkin</a> and used <a href="https://youtu.be/4eaDAX29ogM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youngkin’s opposition</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-mask-vaccine-mandates/2021/08/12/05eb7d70-fad4-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine and mask mandates</a> and the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/mcauliffe-youngkin-virginia-ads/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican nominee’s support</a> for supposed “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-race-trump-2020-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election integrity</a>” efforts that question the validity of the 2020 election as evidence that Youngkin is a chip off the old Trump block.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having won only 44 percent of the vote in Virginia in both 2016 and 2020, Trump has a fairly toxic brand in the commonwealth. And in California’s recent election, Democrats’ efforts to link radio host Larry Elder to Trump do <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appear to have helped turn out Democrats</a> to defeat the attempt to recall Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. However, Youngkin doesn’t have Elder’s history of controversial, Trump-esque statements to attack, and California is a far bluer state than Virginia, so <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/politics/analysis-democrats-virginia-governor-election-trump/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-based attacks may not be enough</a> for McAuliffe to edge out Youngkin.</p>

<h2>Is New Jersey’s gubernatorial race competitive?</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It may be positioned in a smaller typeface below Virginia on the Election Day marquee, but the New Jersey gubernatorial election could prove more interesting than we might have expected a few months ago. The contest between incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, had mostly simmered on the backburner as Murphy held polling leads <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/fdu-poll-murphy-leads-a-mostly-unknown-ciatterelli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of more than 10 points</a> in nonpartisan polls <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nj_081821.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up through August</a>. However, as Biden’s ratings have tumbled, polls suggest <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the New Jersey contest might be a bit closer</a> than it was before, although Murphy remains a substantial favorite to win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, a survey from <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_nj_102721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University</a> — which calls New Jersey home — found Murphy leading by 11 points among registered voters, with the incumbent leading by 8 to 14 points in its likely voter model — a smaller advantage than in Monmouth’s previous polls (9 to 19 points). Additionally, a <a href="https://stockton.edu/hughes-center/polling/documents/2021-1028-stockton-poll-shows-murphy-maintains-lead-over-ciattarelli.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stockton University poll</a> found Murphy ahead by 9 points among likely voters, while a <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/murphy-retains-lead-builds-momentum-among-independents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairleigh Dickinson University survey</a> of registered voters put Murphy up by 9 points, but the pollster didn’t release a likely voter figure. But another recent nonpartisan survey, from <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/new-jersey-2021-gov-murphy-with-six-point-lead-over-republican-challenger-ciattarelli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIX 11/Emerson College</a>, found a closer contest with Murphy ahead by about 4 points among likely voters.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including undecideds who leaned toward a candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> The latest Monmouth and Emerson polls found Murphy remains more popular than not, however, as Monmouth put his approval at 52 percent and his disapproval at 39 percent, while Emerson found 49 percent had a favorable view of the governor versus 47 percent who had an unfavorable impression.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those surveys suggest that Murphy retains a meaningful edge, but they also contain some warning signs for the Democrat. Monmouth’s poll found Biden’s approval rating among New Jerseyans had fallen to 43 percent, while his disapproval rating stood at 49 percent — this in a state Biden carried by 16 points in 2020. And while Monmouth’s polling has consistently found Murphy with strong ratings regarding his handling of COVID-19, the latest poll showed the issue has become less pressing to voters, whereas issues like taxes, as well as jobs and the economy (mirroring a similar trend in Virginia), have become more important. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Murphy doesn’t really have an edge over Ciattarelli on those issues either, as the two candidates ran even on whom voters trusted more to handle jobs and the economy in Monmouth’s polling, with more voters saying they trusted Ciattarelli than Murphy on taxes. Emerson’s poll also showed that 51 percent of voters felt taxes should be the top priority for the next governor, which could work to Ciattarelli’s advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Ciattarelli has an uphill battle ahead of him to actually win, not only because Murphy remains relatively popular and New Jersey is a blue state, but also because his side has fewer resources to work with. Although both candidates took public funding, <a href="https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/gubernatorial/GubPublicFinPP_112020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which severely limited</a> the <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2020/11/we-poured-through-gov-phil-murphys-sprawling-tax-returns-heres-what-we-found.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personally wealthy</a> Murphy’s ability to self-fund, outside groups supporting the incumbent governor <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/10/nj-governor-race-spending-soars-to-nearly-46m-almost-double-from-4-years-ago.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have vastly outspent those backing his GOP opponent</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the campaigns of Murphy and Ciattarelli have each spent around $12.5 million, pro-Murphy independent committees have spent $18.4 million, compared with just $2.7 million by pro-Ciattarelli groups. Most of the spending on Ciattarelli’s behalf comes from the Republican Governors Association, but notably the RGA hasn’t spent much more than it did on behalf of the Republican nominee for governor in Murphy’s initial race back in 2017. That, along with the polling data, still shows Ciattarelli is an underdog — but perhaps he’s not quite as far out of the race as it once seemed.</p>

<h2>What else is at stake in Virginia and New Jersey</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Virginia and New Jersey have more on the line on Tuesday than just their governor’s races, though. Virginians will also be voting for lieutenant governor and attorney general, and what happens at the top of the ticket in the gubernatorial contest will likely have a strong effect on the results in those races. That’s because recent elections have seen very little split-ticket voting, so the <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/democratic-domination-in-the-old-dominion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two parties have won similar vote shares</a> across all three contests. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, the party that wins the governorship will likely also win the other two positions, both of which Democrats currently hold, although an extremely tight election could produce a split-ticket result. We have limited polling to work with for the lieutenant governor and attorney general races, but the numbers we have seen suggests they are also quite close.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But regardless of the results, some history will be made in Virginia’s statewide down-ballot contests. For starters, its lieutenant governor race will produce the state’s first female lieutenant governor, as Democrat Hala Ayala, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/hala-ayala-lieutenant-governor-virginia/2021/10/15/c10aac82-1d81-11ec-bcb8-0cb135811007_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member of the House of Delegates</a> from northern Virginia, faces Republican Winsome Sears, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/winsome-sears-virginia-lieutenant-governor/2021/10/15/002d1004-26b9-11ec-8831-a31e7b3de188_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">herself a former delegate</a> from the southeastern part of the state. And the pair constitute a historic matchup, as Ayala <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/democrat-hala-ayala-seeks-virginias-first-latina-female-lieutenant-gov-rcna4013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a woman of color</a> who identifies as Afro Latina and works in cybersecurity, while the <a href="https://www.nycaribnews.com/articles/jamaican-born-winsome-sears-vies-for-win-in-virginia-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamaican-born Sears</a> is a Marine Corps veteran and remains the only Black Republican woman to ever be <a href="https://www.localdvm.com/news/capitol-review/one-on-one-with-winsome-sears-republican-candidate-for-virginias-lt-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elected to the House of Delegates</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the race for attorney general will either produce the state’s first AG to win three consecutive terms <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1929/year_to:2021/office_id:12/stage:General" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the 1940s</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/miyares-virginia-attorney-general-race/2021/10/22/08da03e4-32c4-11ec-a1e5-07223c50280a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Latino to hold the office</a>. Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring is seeking his third consecutive term after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mark-herring-run-attorney-general/2020/09/02/d36714f4-ed41-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoning an anticipated gubernatorial run</a> following the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-no-one-should-be-surprised-by-democratic-calls-for-northams-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic Party of Virginia’s turbulent 2019</a>, when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/virginia-attorney-general-blackface/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herring admitted</a> that he’d worn blackface at a party as a college student in 1980. (This came out after reports revealed Gov. Ralph Northam <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/article_67fdd682-2662-11e9-a7d1-c7ed70e09b50.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had posed in a racist photo for his medical school yearbook</a> in the 1980s and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/4/18210638/justin-fairfax-ralph-northam-virginia-sex-assault-allegation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced sexual assault allegations</a>.) But in order to pull this off, he’ll first have to defeat Republican state Del. Jason Miyares, who is Cuban American and a lawyer by trade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Virginians will also elect the 100 members of the House of Delegates, the lower chamber of the state legislature. (The 40-seat Virginia Senate isn’t up again until 2023.) As things stand now, Democrats hold a 55-to-45 edge in the House, but <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZRfFiCDBEYB7M18fDGLH8IrmyMQGdQKqpOu9lLvmdo/edit#gid=1838276900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some Democratic-held seats</a> that the party captured in 2017 and 2019 are competitive and <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could now flip back to the GOP</a> in a more Republican-leaning environment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Furthermore, because of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-delayed-census-has-affected-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the delayed release of census data</a> due to COVID-19, Virginia is holding its state House elections <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/census-delays-virginia-redistricting-november-2021-election/291-96095d24-f19c-44f0-80a9-d94f463323df" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under the lines drawn after the 2010 census</a> instead of a new map <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/will-virginia-delegates-have-to-run-again-in-2022-a-judge-could-decide-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflecting the population changes</a> in the 2020 census. As such, Republicans might stand to benefit because much of the House map was <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/republicans-certain-to-retain-control-of-virginia-house-of-delegates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally drawn to heavily advantage the GOP</a>. Additionally, the old lines don’t account for <a href="http://statchatva.org/2020/01/27/population-growth-in-virginia-slowest-in-a-century-as-out-migration-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the disproportionate population growth</a> the more Democratic-leaning areas have experienced over the past decade, especially in Northern Virginia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, New Jersey also has its legislative elections on Tuesday, but there’s not much drama there. Democrats hold a 25-to-15 advantage in the state Senate and a 52-to-28 edge in the General Assembly. <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/10/the-entire-nj-legislature-is-up-for-grabs-on-election-day-here-are-the-races-to-watch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s little reason to think</a> their majorities in either chamber are under threat.</p>

<h2>The parade of special elections continues</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also three special elections for Congress taking place on Tuesday. The two general elections in Ohio — one in the dark-blue <strong>11th District</strong>, one in the solidly red <strong>15th District</strong> — are uncompetitive,<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primaries, which you might remember from August, were &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ohios-two-special-primary-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;much more interesting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> although the winning candidates’ margins will give us more data about whether Democrats or Republicans are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-new-mexico-1st-special-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outperforming expectations</a> so far in the 2022 election cycle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the primary phase of the special election in <strong>Florida’s 20th District</strong> looks like a jump ball. The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/FL/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Florida district</a>, left vacant by the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-alcee-hastings-civil-right-impeached-judge-congress-obituary-20210406-lnjgt4hokrh3zdzacufao4erqm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death of former Rep. Alcee Hastings</a> in April, is extremely blue, so the winner of the Democratic primary is all but guaranteed to win the January general election. However, 11 Democrats are on the ballot, and at least six could plausibly win the nomination. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No polls have been conducted since July, but health care executive Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick is leading the money race, having raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8FL20032/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.8 million</a> through Oct. 13 — $3.7 million of it from her own pockets. Broward County Commissioner Barbara Sharief has pulled in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20134/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$895,000</a> and has also been <a href="https://friendsofbarbarashariefforcongress.com/press-and-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> by neighboring Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel and a former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Broward County Commissioner Dale Holness, a <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-dale-holness-alcee-hastings-congress-20210412-56aj375pm5g3lacvkduoma6pgi-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close ally of the late Hastings</a>, has also raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20159/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$584,000</a>. State Sen. Perry Thurston (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20183/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$458,000</a>) and state House Minority Leader Bobby DuBose (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20209/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$419,000</a>) round out the top five fundraisers. Finally, state Rep. Omari Hardy has pulled in only <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20217/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$172,000</a> but has earned a national following online for his progressive activism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As always, there are <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/10/06/liberal-moderate-rift-not-a-factor-in-crowded-florida-primary-to-succeed-alcee-hastings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some ideological divisions in the race</a>: For instance, Cherfilus-McCormick (who has the endorsement of 2020 presidential candidate and author Marianne Williamson) and Hardy (who has the endorsement of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee) are pitching themselves as progressives, while Sharief has called herself a “fiscal moderate and a social progressive.” But the race has largely avoided devolving into a proxy war between the left and the establishment. Instead, issues such as <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/08/biden-haiti-migration-refugee-democrats-backlash-state-department/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. policy toward Haiti</a> (the district is home to many Haitian Americans) have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/23/us-house-races-election-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken center stage</a>.</p>

<h2>Several mayoral races are progressive-moderate showdowns</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you’re looking for left-vs.-establishment proxy wars, though, the nation’s mayoral races have you covered. At least five major cities will choose between a progressive and a more moderate Democrat to be their next mayor.</p>



<ul><li>In <strong>Boston</strong>, <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/massachusetts2/2021/10_19_2021_marginals.pdf">polls</a> have put City Councilor Michelle Wu around <a href="https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2021/10/Crosstabs-2021-10-Boston-Mayor-Mayor-City-Council.pdf">30 points</a> ahead of City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George. Wu, a protegée of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is a <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/10/18/michelle-wu-boston-city-councilor-mayor-election-chicago">dyed-in-the-wool progressive</a>, while Essaibi George is <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/10/21/annissa-essaibi-george-mayor-boston-electon">more closely aligned</a> with Biden and former Mayor Marty Walsh (who left city hall to become Biden’s secretary of labor). Either Wu or Essaibi George would be the first woman and the first person of color to be elected mayor of Boston, a city with a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-boston-busing-crisis-was-never-intended-to-work/474264/">sordid history of racism</a> but that has become <a href="http://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/32e9b68a-ce1b-41c7-808c-0395cb4f4d19">majority-minority</a>.</li><li>The mayor’s office is also open in <strong>Seattle</strong>, where former City Council President Bruce Harrell is going head-to-head against current City Council President Lorena González. Progressives like <a href="https://lorenaforseattle.com/endorsements/">Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Pramila Jayapal</a> have lined up behind González, while Harrell was regarded as <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/former-council-president-bruce-harrell-touts-community-roots-strength-and-unity-in-bid-for-seattle-mayor/">more business-friendly</a> during his <a href="https://crosscut.com/politics/2021/10/what-gonzalez-and-harrells-council-votes-say-about-their-mayoral-bids">time on the council</a>. Harrell has taken the <a href="https://projects.seattletimes.com/2021/seattle-mayor-candidates-mayoral-general-election-guide/">more moderate (though still pretty liberal) positions</a> in this race, too, and he led González in the <a href="https://www.nwprogressive.org/weblog/2021/10/as-voting-begins-in-the-2021-seattle-mayoral-race-bruce-harrell-has-a-sixteen-point-lead.html">most recent poll</a>, 48 percent to 32 percent. González also stumbled in the home stretch when she put out an ad in which a white rape survivor accused Harrell, who is Black and Japanese, of not taking sexual-abuse allegations in city government seriously. Harrell denounced the ad as racist, and González eventually <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/m-lorena-gonzalez-pulls-ad-against-bruce-harrell-that-many-criticized-as-racist-in-final-weeks-of-seattle-mayoral-race/">agreed to stop airing it</a>.</li><li>By contrast, there’s no clear favorite in the race to be the next mayor of <strong>Cleveland</strong>; the <a href="https://www.bw.edu/news/2021/fall/10-justin-bibb-leads-kevin-kelley-in-bw-cri-mayoral-poll-40-still-undecided">two</a> <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/news/justin-bibb-kevin-kelley-kick-off-general-election-with-endorsements-poll">polls</a> we’ve seen have both been within the margin of error, with around 40 percent of voters undecided. The <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/news/door-to-door-getting-to-know-justin-bibb-and-kevin-kelley">contrasts in the race are sharp</a>: City Council President Kevin Kelley is a 53-year-old white moderate with the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Frank Jackson, and nonprofit executive Justin Bibb is a 34-year-old Black progressive who has never before run for office. One of the biggest issues in the race has been <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/elections/cleveland-mayoral-election/cleveland-police-reform-proposal-issue-24-still-fueling-debate/95-6f0802e1-2be8-43e6-a84a-f9b9d3001cba">Issue 24</a>, a ballot measure to create a civilian commission to oversee the Cleveland police. Bibb supports it, while Kelley opposes it.</li><li>Passions over policing are still high in <strong>Minneapolis</strong>, too, where Mayor Jacob Frey will face voters for the first time since the murder of George Floyd and the ensuing protests that engulfed the city. With Minneapolitans also voting on local ballot measures to give the mayor’s office more power or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-reform-is-on-the-ballot-in-minneapolis-but-its-about-more-than-defunding-the-police/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-reform-is-on-the-ballot-in-minneapolis-but-its-about-more-than-defunding-the-police/">take the police department out from under its control</a>, the campaign has become a <a href="https://www.startribune.com/public-safety-debate-dominates-mayoral-race/600107324/">referendum on the best way to ensure public safety</a>. Frey has opposed <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/06/26/minneapolis-council-puts-plan-to-dismantle-police-in-motion">previous efforts to defund the police</a> and attempted to <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/20/veto-threat-is-the-latest-wrinkle-in-controversial-mpls-public-safety-ballot-proposal">keep the police-reform ballot measure off the ballot</a>, while his two most prominent opponents, community organizer Sheila Nezhad and former state Rep. Kate Knuth, support the measure and say Frey didn’t do enough to reform policing before Floyd’s death. Nezhad and Knuth have even <a href="https://www.startribune.com/divided-left-field-of-minneapolis-mayoral-hopefuls-have-unified-message-don-t-rank-frey/600107813/?refresh=true">formed an alliance</a>, encouraging their supporters to rank the other second under Minneapolis’s ranked-choice voting system (and not to rank Frey at all). The <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2021/10/an-internal-poll-showed-frey-with-a-19-point-lead-in-the-minneapolis-mayoral-race-but-in-an-rcv-election-he-could-still-lose/">only poll of the race</a> gave Frey 44 percent, Nezhad 25 percent and Knuth 10 percent in the first round, but the poll was conducted by Frey’s supporters, so it’s very possible the race is closer than that.</li><li><strong>Buffalo</strong> is smaller than the other cities here, but its mayor’s race has big drama. Back in June, union representative and democratic socialist India Walton shockingly upset four-term Mayor Byron Brown, 52 percent to 45 percent, in the Democratic primary. But Brown refused to give up his campaign: After a <a href="https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/politics/elections/mayor-byron-brown-loses-court-decision-india-walton-mayoral-race/71-e5ca91fc-610b-4a1a-9b92-226f3b5d6530">failed attempt</a> to make the November ballot as an independent, he is <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/byron-brown-launches-write-in-campaign-for-mayor-as-others-eye-the-race/article_4e459acc-d83f-11eb-b7cb-cb943e248a2a.html">waging a write-in campaign</a> to keep his job. As Walton’s only opponent, Brown is getting support from <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/26/democrat-gets-gop-support-as-write-in-over-socialist-in-buffalo-mayors-race/">local conservatives</a>; some prominent Democrats, such as Gov.

If no candidate receives a majority on Tuesday, the top two finishers would face off in a Nov. 30 runoff.</p>

<h2>Ballot measures are the icing on the cake</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In odd-year elections, ballot measures are often some of the most interesting races to watch. Unfortunately, 2021 is a bit of a down year for them — perhaps the lingering effects of the pandemic, which also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/coronavirus-upends-elections-ballot-access-point-concern/story?id=70288113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowed ballot-measure campaigns in 2020</a>. But there are nevertheless a few worth watching — most obviously, three constitutional amendments over voting rights in <strong>New York</strong>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Proposal 1</strong> would change the state’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex redistricting process</a> to make it easier for the ruling party to pass its desired maps. New York has a bipartisan redistricting commission, but it’s only advisory in nature: The legislature has the final say in either approving the commission’s proposals or simply imposing its own. Under current law, when the legislature is controlled by a single party (as it is currently, by Democrats), a two-thirds supermajority is required to pass any maps. Proposal 1, however, would <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/capital-region/politics/2021/09/24/new-york-s-november-ballot-questions---1---amending-the-state-s-redistricting-process-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower this threshold</a> to a simple majority to pass one of the commission’s maps and a 60 percent majority to impose its own.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Practically speaking, this may not make a huge difference to the current redistricting process, since Democrats already enjoy two-thirds supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature. But it could be the difference between a minority party having a seat at the table in future redistricting cycles, and it could also allow current Democrats to gerrymander the state even if they have a few dissenters within their ranks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Further down the ballot, New Yorkers will find <strong>Proposal 3</strong>, which would <a href="https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/politics/2021/09/27/new-york-s-2021-ballot-questions---3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliminate the requirement</a> that people register to vote 10 days before an election, and <strong>Proposal 4</strong>, which would <a href="https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/politics/2021/09/27/new-york-s-2021-ballot-questions---4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliminate the requirement</a> that voters provide an excuse to vote absentee. With voting access increasingly a hot-button partisan issue, New York has gotten a lot of attention for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/nyregion/early-voting-reform-laws-ny.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how restrictive its voting laws are</a>, especially for a blue state. Democrats have been working to liberalize them since taking full control of state government in 2018, but because many of New York’s voting restrictions are enshrined in the state constitution, they couldn’t eliminate them right away. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If these amendments pass, the legislature would be able to pass a law allowing people to register to vote on Election Day (which is one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/opinion/graphics-an-excitingly-simple-solution-to-youth-turnout-for-the-primaries-and-beyond.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most powerful election reforms</a> for increasing turnout) and would not need to renew a temporary law (expiring at the end of the year) that added “risk of contracting … a communicable disease like COVID-19” to the list of <a href="https://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingAbsentee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acceptable excuses for voting absentee</a>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Almost exactly two months after the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed a novel abortion ban to go into effect in Texas</a>, making it functionally impossible to obtain abortions in the state, the law is back in the justices’ laps. Today, though, the justices won’t directly consider the constitutionality of the ban, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/18/texas-heartbeat-bill-abortions-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which prohibits abortions after fetal cardiac activity can be detected</a> — often before women know they’re pregnant. Instead, they’ll be grappling with the law’s unique structure, which raises some thorny questions about the federal courts’ power over the states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What Texas did wasn’t noteworthy because of <em>at what stage</em> it banned abortion. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plenty of other states</a> have already passed laws restricting abortion after six weeks, or banning it outright. The Texas law’s innovation was <em>how</em> it banned abortion: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/us/politics/texas-abortion-law-facts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Private citizens who successfully sue an individual</a> for helping a woman get a prohibited abortion are eligible for a $10,000 reward, putting responsibility for enforcing the law in the hands of vigilante plaintiffs — and, crucially, taking it out of the hands of state officials, like prosecutors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not clear at this point whether the conservative justices have changed their minds about the Texas law since September. After all, the court recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/us/supreme-court-abortion-texas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose once again</a> to leave the law in place while the legal battle plays out — although it did add the case to its docket at lightning speed, suggesting the justices are looking to make a decision soon. There are signs, though, that the law’s unusual enforcement mechanism may be its undoing: While a majority of justices on the Supreme Court may be willing to reconsider the constitutional right to abortion, giving states the power to pass laws like Texas’s might be a bridge too far even for the court’s conservatives. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It may have dawned on the justices that there’s nothing stopping a state like Massachusetts from passing a similar law on a different issue, like the right to bear arms or free speech on college campuses,” said <a href="https://law.fsu.edu/faculty-staff/mary-ziegler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ziegler</a>, a law professor at Florida State University. And, she added, there are cleaner ways to overturn or limit Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion — including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a case involving a more straightforward Mississippi law</a> that will be heard by the court in December.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At its core, the Texas law is a solution to a dilemma that anti-abortion advocates have struggled with for years. Increasingly, Republican-controlled state legislatures <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2019/03/surge-bans-abortion-early-six-weeks-most-people-know-they-are-pregnant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been willing to pass laws</a> — like a six-week ban on abortion — that openly violate Roe. But with the exception of the Texas ban, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none of those laws are actually in effect</a>, because federal courts <a href="https://time.com/5866714/georgia-heartbeat-abortion-law-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put them on pause</a> while legal challenges played out. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas’s innovation was to make it exceptionally difficult for the courts to get involved. Normally, abortion providers sue a state official in charge of enforcing a given abortion law. But by making individuals responsible for enforcement, Texas changed the game — leaving abortion providers with no one to sue, and no obvious way for the federal courts to intervene. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was, as Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/21a24_8759.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted in his dissent</a> from the court’s September decision to let the Texas law go into effect, an “unprecedented” approach that was apparently designed to cut the federal courts out of the loop. And it was successful, at least provisionally, since the law is in effect in Texas and, as a result, abortion is currently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-lifestyle-health-travel-texas-fbc505c3db4a08af51ba409a91ea161c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtually impossible to obtain</a> in the state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But now, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-asks-us-supreme-court-block-texas-abortion-law-2021-10-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced with reviewing a separate lawsuit from President Biden’s administration</a>, the justices have given themselves an opportunity to untangle some of the knottiness of the Texas law — specifically, what role the federal courts have to play. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/22/1047619075/the-supreme-court-keeps-texas-abortion-law-in-place-but-agrees-to-review-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They’re looking at two different questions</a>: whether the federal government can even bring a lawsuit in federal court to stop the law from being enforced, and whether states, such as Texas, can try to create an end-run around the federal courts when constitutional rights are at stake. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Ziegler, the structure of the Texas law could be a deal-breaker even to justices open to stricter abortion laws, since the law allows a state to functionally override a Supreme Court precedent. That approach <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-06/op-ed-how-texas-abortion-law-could-threaten-other-constitutional-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could extend far beyond abortion</a> and be used with other constitutional rights. “Before, Texas looked to be in the clear with this court, and that isn’t the case now,” she said. “That doesn’t mean the state will definitely lose, but the law is in real jeopardy now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, too, this case adds a new layer of complication at a moment that was already very busy and high-profile for the justices. In a few days, they’ll hear oral arguments in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-york-state-rifle-pistol-association-inc-v-bruen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court’s first big gun rights case</a> in over a decade. And then, in early December, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ll weigh another abortion restriction</a> — a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which could give them the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade. So the back-and-forth over the Texas law might be an unwelcome distraction for the conservative justices, who didn’t need another chance to reconsider whether abortion is constitutional. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also not a done deal. After all, the Texas law is still in effect, which signals that five of the court’s conservative justices are still unconcerned about abortion’s availability in one of the country’s biggest states, even while Roe v. Wade is still on the books. And in that sense, whatever happens next, anti-abortion advocates in the state have already scored a big victory. By allowing the restriction to go into effect, the Supreme Court permitted the state to effectively ban abortion, forcing women to flood neighboring states to obtain the procedure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the conservative justices’ willingness to let that happen could signal that anti-abortion advocates are about to win a much bigger victory — even if the Texas law doesn’t ultimately survive.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Police Reform Is On The Ballot In Minneapolis. But It’s About More Than Defunding The Police.</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On June 7, 2020, in the wake of the high-profile murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, nine members of the City Council made a public statement: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/minneapolis-police-abolish.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The police department couldn’t just be “reformed”</a> — public safety in the city would have to be drastically altered. On that summer afternoon, large white letters leaning against the stage spelled out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLWgl-lb9pI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Defund Police.”</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since Floyd’s murder, “defund the police” has become a political catchphrase used to rally supporters and opponents of a policy that is far more complex than the rhetoric suggests. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-like-the-ideas-behind-defunding-the-police-more-than-the-slogan-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unpopular among the American public</a>, it has been used as a bogeyman by Republicans — and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/defying-defund-police-calls-democrat-adams-leads-nyc-mayors-race-2021-06-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some moderate Democrats</a> — to scare voters away from electing progressives as violent crime rates have risen nationwide. (Despite the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/23/defund-the-police-democrats-477609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fears of some Democrats</a>, though, it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/rp_griffin/status/1367950877634535424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unclear</a> whether it has actually <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurt the broader party</a> at the ballot box.) But the slogan can <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/3/21276824/defund-police-divest-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take many forms in practice</a>, from <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-26/lapd-funds-reallocation-george-floyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reallocating part of the police budget to social services</a> to <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/elections/cleveland-mayoral-election/cleveland-police-reform-proposal-issue-24-still-fueling-debate/95-6f0802e1-2be8-43e6-a84a-f9b9d3001cba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting up accountability structures</a>. Often it’s an outright misnomer, simply a way for criminal-justice activists to express their anguish and frustration with the repeated killings of people of color at the hands of police.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Such is the case now in Minneapolis, where on Tuesday voters will decide the fate of City Question 2, a municipal ballot measure that would replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety under the City Council’s control. The debate leading up to the vote shows just how much one idea can take on wildly different meanings. Just like “defund the police,” Question 2 is more than the sum of its parts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Black activists who want to protect their communities from violence look at Question 2 and don’t always see the same risks and opportunities. The Rev. JaNaé Bates, director of communications for Isaiah, a faith-based nonprofit that advocates for social and economic justice, is working with the nonprofit coalition that got Question 2 on the ballot. She’s frustrated that Black Minneapolitans are consolidated into neighborhoods that are underserved and overpoliced and wants to see both of those problems change.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Audua Pugh, the board chair of the Jordan Area Community Council, a neighborhood association on the city’s predominantly Black Northside, said she saw the City Council’s announcement back in the summer of 2020 as a betrayal. To her, Question 2 amounts to a signal that her neighborhood, long ignored by the city and denied infrastructure common in other parts of town, would lose more and not gain anything new. Since Floyd’s death, she has successfully sued the city to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/judge-orders-minneapolis-hire-more-132100293.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demand more police</a> and is a fierce advocate against the ballot question. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That Bates and Pugh — two Black women who share very similar concerns about the dangers posed to their community by both police and criminal gun violence — could end up on opposite sides of a public safety plan says a lot about the divisiveness of Question 2 and the “defund the police” movement generally. The question has roughly split the city in half: Major figures on the left, such as <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ellison-and-omar-support-minneapolis-policing-ballot-question/600092577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Ilhan Omar and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison</a>, support it; major figures of the establishment, such as <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/episode/2021/10/21/minneapolis-mayor-jacob-frey-on-major-issues-facing-the-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayor Jacob Frey</a> and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, oppose it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the debate around it has less to do with the actual content of the question than it does with the symbolism. Question 2 is a “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/22/minneapolis-reckoning-defund-the-police-513568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defund the police</a>” proposal that doesn’t actually defund the police. Instead, it hopes to make police more accountable by creating a broader approach to public safety. Except it might not do that either, depending on how other city races pan out. In a contentious election year marked by a citywide increase in gun violence, the proposal has become a way for citizens to express their feelings on a whole range of issues. As Pugh put it, “It’s not what you say. It’s what people hear.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At its core, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/31/the-yes-4-minneapolis-charter-amendment-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 2</a> wouldn’t eliminate the police department, but the city would no longer be required to have a formal police department or minimum police staffing levels that have been mandated <a href="http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/67/v67i05p226-238.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1961</a>. The question would also create a new Department of Public Safety that could include both police and other kinds of safety officers, such as therapists, social workers or violence interrupters. And the city’s hierarchy would change, too. Right now the MPD is accountable to their chief and the mayor; the new system would have police answering to the head of the Department of Public Safety, who would answer to both the mayor and City Council. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those are the broad strokes, but the fine details remain difficult to pin down, said Jon Collins, a senior reporter for Minnesota Public Radio who has been covering the question and debates around it. The City Council has not been able to publicly discuss plans for implementing the question should it pass, in part <a href="https://twitter.com/KendalKillian/status/1453450195648327686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because the city attorney</a> has <a href="https://m.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-warned-against-using-city-resources-to-advocate-for-policing-ballot-questio/600056497/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned that doing so would violate campaign laws</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, other elections may affect the way the initiative is enacted if it passes. If a lot of the current City Council members lose their seats, that could result in a Department of Public Safety that’s really just the police department, unchanged, under another name. Meanwhile, a separate proposal, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/31/what-to-know-about-the-strong-mayor-ballot-amendment-in-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City Question 1</a>, would give the mayor more power than the City Council. These measures are incompatible, because the council wouldn’t be able to be in charge of the Department of Public Safety under the so-called “strong mayor” system. But it’s very possible both could pass. If so, the issue would likely have to be settled by the state Supreme Court, Collins said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is all intensely technical and wonkish, but it has inspired equally intense division. A <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-poll-public-safety-minneapolis-police-crime-charter-amendment-ballot-question/600097989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September poll</a> conducted by Mason-Dixon on behalf of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Minnesota Public Radio, KARE-TV and the PBS series “Frontline” found that, at the time, 49 percent of likely voters supported Question 2, while 41 percent were opposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The poll gave supporters a lead to go along with their financial advantage — as of Oct. 19, they had raised <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Minneapolis,_Minnesota,_Question_2,_Replace_Police_Department_with_Department_of_Public_Safety_Initiative_(November_2021)#Campaign_finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.0 million versus opponents’ $1.6 million</a>. But the poll also showed opponents within striking distance and showed Question 2 still doesn’t have majority support in the city. That’s important because support for ballot measures often <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/california-election-2020/2019/10/ballot-california-polling-trend-slump-fact-check-myth-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decreases over the course of a campaign</a>, as change-averse voters default to the status quo.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, it also showed that divisions over the question are particularly strong within the Black community. The poll oversampled Black voters in an effort to get a more accurate read on their feelings about public safety in the city. Black voters said they opposed replacing the MPD with a Department of Public Safety, 47 percent to 42 percent (white voters supported it 51 percent to 40 percent). Bates, Pugh and Collins all said they had seen divisions within the Black community along generational lines, with younger people being more likely to support the question and older people (even individuals who have <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/10/14/some-critics-of-mpd-not-sold-on-proposal-to-overhaul-public-safety-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been involved in campaigns for police reform and accountability</a>) opposing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those numbers reflect years of problems between the MPD and Black and brown Minneapolitans. A decade ago, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/02/26/clean-up-strike-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the city shut down its Metro Gang Strike Force</a> after discovering misconduct by police in the elite unit that <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/08/25/strike-force-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included theft</a> and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-third-precinct-served-as-playground-for-renegade-cops/571076562/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battery</a>. Over the past 20 years, the city has paid out <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/investigations/minneapolis-police-misconduct-payouts-top-70-million/89-489d102d-43cc-457e-9f7f-2ce471ccd2d5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $70 million</a> in misconduct settlements, even as city records show that <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vast majority of misconduct complaints against MPD results in no internal discipline</a>. Officers killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/03/us/minneapolis-police-use-of-force.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three other Black men</a> in the five years leading up to Floyd’s death. And in 2007, five high-ranking Black police officers, including the current Chief Medaria Arradondo, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/high-ranking-black-cops-sue-minneapolis-police-department/12081986/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued the city over racism within the department</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The city, particularly the Northside, is also in the midst of a rapid increase in gun violence. As in most of the country, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/07/27/violent-crime-surges-across-minnesota-with-record-murders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violent crime rose</a> across the state of Minnesota in 2020. There were <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/minneapolis-bloody-summer-puts-city-on-pace-for-most-violent-year-in-a-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">48 murders in Minneapolis in 2019 and 84 in 2020</a>, with some parts of the Northside seeing a 200 percent increase in gunfire. <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/crime/witnesses-say-child-shot-in-north-minneapolis/89-4f5294f1-4d26-41e7-8911-220b9a6609f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Black Northside children have died</a> and one remains critically hospitalized after surviving a head wound. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Pugh and Bates told me they see their community trapped between these two dangers. “This is two sides of the same coin,” Bates said, explaining why she was advocating for Question 2. “What folks are feeling in terms of the uptick in violence and also not feeling protected by police officers … watching the response time from police get slower and slower and slower. There has to be an off ramp to that.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pugh, in explaining why she opposed the question, echoed the same ideas: “The system that was made wasn’t designed for us, for Black people. Make sure you put that. Because the system wasn’t made for us, and it continues to oppress us.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a whole, the polling shows Minneapolis voters have seemingly paradoxical feelings about their police force. It found that voters have an unfavorable opinion of the MPD, 53 percent to 33 percent — but oppose reducing its size, 55 percent to 29 percent. The message is as clear as it is conflicting: Police are not doing a good job, and people are worried about what happens if there are fewer of them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That dynamic is especially pronounced among Black voters. They view the department unfavorably by a 58 percent to 28 percent margin, yet they oppose reducing its size by a whopping 75 percent to 14 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a messy pile of conflicting feelings that can’t really be clarified by science. There’s never been a similar measure anywhere to study in order to understand the likely outcomes of Question 2, said Aaron Chalfin, a professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. And while <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~jmccrary/chalfin_mccrary2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows that the presence of police</a> and spending on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police decreases crime</a>, the question doesn’t actually call for<em> fewer</em> police. Likewise, the research also suggests the availability of good, legal jobs reduces crime and doesn’t show a connection between the severity of punishment and crime reduction. It’s not clear how non-police public safety officers — their presence and spending on them — would fit into these documented trends. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When we spoke to Bates and Pugh, they both talked about their own hope and cynicism, but they put those feelings in different places. Pugh had hope that the police department could be reformed into something that did serve the Black community, and she had a hard time believing the City Council could create a completely new and effective safety program. Bates, on the other hand, had a lot of hopes for the Department of Public Safety and reserved her cynicism for the possibility of change within the MPD culture. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which leaves another big question besides just “will the question pass?” After this much division, can people who agree on nearly everything come back and work together again? “We all want the same thing,” Bates said. “We all want people in Minneapolis to be safe. We all want people in Minneapolis to be able to have the resources they need. And in the event that a crisis happens, that they can pick up the phone and trust that the right response will show up.”</p>]]></description>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Former President Donald Trump ended his presidency <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more unpopular than any of the last 12 presidents</a> at the end of their first terms and he is still unpopular post-presidency according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s new average of Trump’s favorability numbers</a>. Currently, 41.4 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the former president, while 53 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1539" height="664" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.00-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.00-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.00-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.00-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Overall, Trump’s unfavorability — now that he’s out of office we’re tracking his favorability numbers rather than his approval rating, both of which capture popularity — has remained steady just as his <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low approval numbers mostly did</a> during his presidency. His popularity took a dip following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which meant that his overall favorability was quite low when we began tracking those numbers in February. But as you can see in the chart above, Trump’s favorability numbers have more or less returned to where his approval rating was before the insurrection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Trump is still more unpopular than popular with the American public as a whole. Yet, despite Trump’s overall unfavorability, as my colleague Nathaniel Rakich wrote about last week, the majority of Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-majority-of-republican-voters-actively-want-trump-to-run-for-president-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">want Trump to run for president again</a>, with polls suggesting that Republicans overall thought Trump <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/06/two-thirds-of-republicans-want-trump-to-retain-major-political-role-44-want-him-to-run-again-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a positive impact on politics</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve never tracked former presidents’ favorability before, but Trump’s continued influence on the Republican Party is unusual. As such, we’ll be monitoring his popularity in the lead-up to the 2022 midterms and beyond. If he remains a key player in the party and Republican voters remain enthusiastic about his candidacy, that all could prove beneficial to a potential 2024 presidential bid.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On that note, we’re also launching <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new average of Vice President Kamala Harris’s job approval numbers</a>. That’s because Joe Biden, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-inauguration-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-ronald-reagan-pennsylvania-48d1659d4469999be87fbd87d560a52c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America’s oldest sitting president</a>, isn’t necessarily going to run for reelection in 2024. He even called himself a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/us/politics/joe-biden-vice-president-pick.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“transition candidate”</a> on the 2020 campaign trail, which is why it’s important we track what Americans think of his No. 2, as it’s possible Harris runs for president in 2024. Harris’s approval rating currently sits at 42.7<strong> </strong>percent while her disapproval rating is at 52.5<strong> </strong>percent. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1527" height="675" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.13-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.13-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.13-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.13-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Notably, though, Harris’s standing is not as good as Biden’s. Both her approval and disapproval ratings are worse than his. The president’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating</a> currently sits at 43.7 percent and his disapproval rating at 51 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Harris’s numbers aren’t <em>all</em> that different from Biden’s — her overall job approval seems to be largely tied at this point to his — but <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/kamala-harris-approval-rating-polls-vs-biden-other-vps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Los Angeles Times’s Harris favorability tracker has found that</a> the VP’s net favorability (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) is lower than former Vice Presidents Mike Pence, Biden, Dick Cheney and Al Gore. They also note in their analysis that Harris’s favorability began to decline in June after she was tasked with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/vice-president-kamala-harris-unveils-strategy-to-address-illegal-immigration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tackling immigration</a>, a thorny issue for Democrats.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible, as Peter Nicholas <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/kamala-harris-interview/619657/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in The Atlantic in August</a>, that racism and sexism could be to blame for Harris’s low numbers. At FiveThirtyEight, we’ve written how <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-say-they-would-vote-for-a-woman-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women politicians, and especially women of color like Harris</a>, are often held to a different standard than men. And as Nicholas noted in his article, Harris has a high unfavorability margin among men (now 17 percentage points according to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/kamala-harris-approval-rating-polls-vs-biden-other-vps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Los Angeles Times</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, though, it’s still very early at this point, and a lot will likely change between now and the 2024 presidential election. But in the meantime, we’ll be tracking Trump’s favorability numbers and Harris’s approval ratings to get a better sense of how Americans think of them — especially if either, or both, are on the ballot in 2024.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Election Day is next Tuesday and one of the closest races to watch is the Virginia governor’s race between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin. While McAuliffe has remained consistently in the lead, the race is now narrowing. <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/virginia-2021-poll-points-to-photo-finish-in-governor-s-race">A recent Emerson College/Nexstar Media poll</a> shows a tied race with 49 percent of likely voters supporting McAuliffe and 49 percent of likely voters supporting Youngkin. FiveThirtyEight’s polling average of the Virginia race now has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/">McAuliffe at 47.6 percent and Youngkin at 46.1 percent</a>.</li><li>New Jersey will also host a gubernatorial race on Tuesday. There, New Jerseyans will decide on whether to keep Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in office or replace him with Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. Some <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/new-jersey/">recent polls have suggested a close race</a>, but a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_NJ_102721/">Monmouth University poll</a> released on Wednesday found Murphy with an 11-point lead over Ciattarelli, 50 percent to 39 percent among registered voters. This marks a double-digit lead for Murphy, but his lead is down 2 points since Monmouth last asked voters in September.</li><li>More Americans now say they want an increase in police spending, per <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/">a recent Pew Research Center poll</a>. The poll found that 21 percent of Americans want to see police spending “increased a lot,” which is up 10 points from 2020. Even the share who want to see spending “increased a little” has risen 6 points from last year to 26 percent. To be sure, a plurality of Americans, 37 percent, want police spending to stay the same, but this has decreased 5 points since 2020.</li><li>A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel has approved <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/things-covid-19-vaccination-kids-age-12/story?id=80126470">Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for children</a> ages 5 to 11, making it likely that kids could receive the shot as soon as November. Yet among Americans, support for vaccinating children against COVID-19 is split along familiar party lines. A majority of Democrats, 81 percent, support COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, while 54 percent of Republicans oppose it, according to a recent <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/10/27/voters-want-young-children-to-be-vaccinated-against-the-coronavirus">Data for Progress poll</a>.</li><li>Some parents are also concerned about the potential side effects of the vaccine, according to a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/parents-vaccinating-children-age-5-11">recent Ipsos/Marketing for Change poll</a>. The poll found that 48 percent of parents with kids in the 5 to 11 age range were weighing vaccine side effects while 40 percent said protecting their child from getting sick with COVID-19 was a factor. Another 36 percent said their children’s ability to participate in school activities that require vaccination is a factor when weighing the decision to vaccinate their children. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

Climate Change Conference in Glasgow this weekend to demonstrate where the country stands on addressing climate change. If they wanted to make a blanket statement at the summit about how Americans view climate change, they could say most of us <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/dramatic-increase-in-public-beliefs-and-worries-about-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think it’s happening</a> (76 percent, according to a September survey from Yale Program on Climate Change Communication) and<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355427/americans-concerned-global-warming.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> most of us <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355427/americans-concerned-global-warming.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry about it at least a fair amount</a> (65 percent, according to a March survey from Gallup). Everything else about climate change, much like <em>everything else</em>, depends on your political affiliation, age, race and education. Zoom in again, however, and where you call home may just be the deciding factor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As my colleagues Alex Samuels and Mackenzie Wilkes <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-want-the-government-to-act-on-climate-change-whats-the-hold-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote earlier this month</a>, Democrats and Republicans are deep in a squabble over a budget bill containing a number of climate provisions — <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_100421/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actions that Americans broadly want</a>. But Americans are a lot more divided on how important it is to fight global warming: In a January 2020 survey from the Pew Research Center, 78 percent of Democrats said <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/16/u-s-concern-about-climate-change-is-rising-but-mainly-among-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dealing with climate change should be a top priority</a> for the executive and legislative branches, while only 21 percent of Republicans said the same. Instead of favoring government regulations to solve climate change, a majority of Republicans are hoping private businesses and technology will help combat climate change — now and into the future.</p>

That goes for younger Republicans, too, who are more likely than older Republicans to support government regulations <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/06/PS_2020.06.23_government-and-climate_00-015.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to shift the country toward renewable energy sources</a>, according to a 2020 survey from Pew. Those with at least some college education are also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/06/PS_2020.06.23_government-and-climate_00-09.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to believe our activity contributes to climate change</a>. And women — Republican and Democrat — are more concerned about and are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2019/11/PS_11.25.19_climate.energy-00-03.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to change their lifestyle</a> to protect the environment than men.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So we’re divided in all the ways we normally are, yet there is some space for unity in thinking we ought to do something about our warming earth. Let’s take a look at what role geography plays in how Americans experience climate change and how they want their government to act. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a study</a> from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason Center for Climate Change Communication,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data from the survey was taken from a dataset of representative climate surveys with a sample size over 25,000 U.S. adults. Researchers &lt;a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;applied a statistical model to obtain subnational estimates&lt;/a&gt; considering demographic and geographic characteristics from the U.S. Census, such as gender, race and ethnicity, and level of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a> exactly <em>who</em> wants the government to act depends on <em>where</em> you ask.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans in the hardest-hit regions want climate change to be a priority" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r7p6T/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="720" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As the map above shows, Americans in Coastal, Southern Border and Mountain West communities are the most likely to argue that climate change needs to be a high priority for the government. What these communities have in common is that they’re the most likely to feel the effects of a warming world.</p>



<h2><strong>Where Climate Change Hits The Hardest</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sixty-two percent of U.S. adults said climate change <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2019/11/PS_11.25.19_climate.energy-00-013.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was affecting their local communities</a> at least “some,” according to an October 2019 Pew survey. At a more granular level, Americans from different regions say that climate change is affecting their neighborhoods in disparate ways. For example, Americans living in the Pacific West<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii and Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> and Mountain West<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada and Utah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> were more likely than Americans in the Northeast and Midwest to say wildfires and threatened water sources are some of the major ways climate change is affecting their lives. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pew survey from 2020</a> found that 70 percent of Americans who lived within 25 miles of a coastline <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/11/25/u-s-public-views-on-climate-and-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said climate change was directly affecting them</a> at least “some” — that included 45 percent of Republicans, a higher share compared to Republicans living further from the coast.</p>

Americans from those regions also stand out in their support of climate change legislation, such as fossil fuel regulations and carbon taxes. </p>



<h2><strong>Where Americans Support Climate Action</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the key elements initially in the budget bill would have rewarded utility companies that increase their share of energy from renewable energy sources, known as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/biden-climate-ambitions-die-in-the-senate/ba212f50-5e4f-407b-b3ec-99229c52981d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Energy Performance Program</a> (CEPP). While the CEPP is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/10/28/biden-spending-plan-what-is-in-it/#3CJGSH646VHETHIC4KK66XI3XE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but assured to be dropped from the bill</a> due to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/21/key-senator-presented-an-alternative-power-plant-program-will-it-stick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of support from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin</a>, 66 percent of Americans <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/9/30/voters-support-the-clean-electricity-performance-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported it</a> when provided with a brief description of the program, according to a September survey from Data for Progress. Along the same lines of the CEPP, the Yale study asked Americans whether they would support requiring utilities to produce electricity from renewable energy sources, even if it would cost them an extra $100 per year. The share of residents in metropolitan areas who said they would support such a policy ranged from 7-to-13 percentage points higher than the national average. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Large cities lead the push for renewable energy" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0sh5G/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="759" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Moving away from the big U.S. cities, the Texas counties along the U.S.-Mexico border lean Democratic, though they <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw some of the biggest swings to the right in 2020</a>, and demonstrate above-average support for climate change policies. Though most of these counties are considered rural, they display levels of support for climate legislation on par with those of major metropolitan areas. Looking at the map below in the border counties in the southernmost part of Texas, the share who said global warming will harm them personally ranges from 4-to-17 percent higher than the national average. </p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And when it comes to supporting strategies addressing climate change like taxing fossil fuel companies or setting strict carbon emission limits, we see a similar pattern for Texans living in the southernmost counties.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">America is physically and ideologically diverse, and that's reflected in how different parts of the country experience a warming planet. And when it comes to Americans’ feelings about addressing climate change or whose responsibility it should be, where they live just might trump their political affiliations. But Biden needs the<em> </em>Americans in<em> Congress</em> to bridge the divide to meet his goal <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to cut greenhouse gases in half by 2030</a> — movement on which would be nice to present in Scotland. That future isn’t so far off, but it remains to be seen how much longer we’ll be kicking the can down the road. </p>

	</aside><p data-paragraph="main">In early January 2021, then-President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to persuade</a> Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state’s election results. Raffensperger rejected Trump’s requests as well as his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Now, Raffensperger is facing a primary in 2022 from Rep. Jody Hice, whom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/us/politics/jody-hice-raffensperger-trump-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump has endorsed</a> for Georgia secretary of state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-adam-schiff-is-worried-about-american-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue our conversation</a> about challenges to democracy in America by talking with Raffensperger, whose new book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Integrity-Counts/Brad-Raffensperger/9781637630334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrity Counts</a>,” comes out in November. He describes his experience being targeted by Trump and his supporters. Raffensperger also criticizes fellow Republicans in Georgia for not speaking out against Trump’s false claims of election fraud and for removing him as the chair of the Georgia Board of Elections this year. And he explains why he largely supports the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/big-changes-under-georgias-new-election-law-2021-06-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new voting laws</a> that Georgia Republicans passed since the 2020 election. We ask him what it all means for democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can read select, lightly edited excerpts below.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Galen Druke, host of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast:</strong> Were you or your family afraid [because of the threats directed at you after the 2020 election]?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Brad Raffensperger:</strong> I think that we’re getting concerned. Obviously, we left our house for a few days because they were talking about having a big rally up front. And that was just ginned up by people in positions of power, including the president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Have things abated on your end? Are people no longer threatening elections officials or administrators?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> We’re not seeing that. In the book, the last text — the sexualized texts that Tricia has gotten was probably around Easter day. In the name of Jesus — yes, in the name of Jesus — someone sent her threatening “every day that we pray for your death” … </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> And that’s your wife? So that continued after January 6?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Oh, yeah, that continued well after January 6.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> I know that you supported overall the election changes in Georgia this year. But those laws included making you no longer chair of the state election board, which is responsible for overseeing elections in Georgia. That chair is now selected by the state legislature. Does that make Georgia’s elections more susceptible to meddling from the legislature?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Well, what it really does is it diminishes accountability of the state election board right now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Well, accountability for potentially doing screwy things? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Exactly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Why even do this?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Well, and that’s one aspect that I did not support. Because when the secretary of state chairs the state election board, I am held accountable by the voters. And so I understand that I report to the voters. Now the chair of the state election board actually <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-voting-law-9-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports to the General Assembly</a>. So if you don’t like the decision that’s being made, who do you call? How do you have accountability? It’s so diffuse that everyone can start pointing fingers and it becomes like Washington, D.C. “Oh, I didn’t do that. It was this person, it was that person…” How do you hold anyone accountable? But when the state election board is chaired by the secretary of state, like it has been since the beginning of time here in Georgia, then all of a sudden, you know that you have accountability.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Did you view that as personal retribution?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Oh, yeah, [inaudible]. You know it was. It was really a blame-shifting. People didn’t know who and what had happened, and no one wanted to take responsibility and really speak truth to everyone and say here are the facts: President Trump did not get any votes from 28,000 voters. They skip. 28,000 people skip the presidential ballot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Why won’t Republicans in Georgia speak that truth?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Moral courage. Lack of moral courage. And General Patton said that is probably one of the most lacking aspects of humankind.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> I mean, that’s a pretty big indictment of the Republican lawmakers in your party, that they lack moral courage. Does that make you question whether it’s the party for you?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Oh, no, it doesn’t. It’s both parties. And we have to be honest about that. People don’t stand up on the left side to a lot of the diatribes that they hear from their hard left, and people don’t want to stand up to the hard right. I’m a capital-C conservative. But sometimes you have to say to people, I think with kindness and gentleness, but you need to speak the truth.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> In some sense, it sounds like there are tradeoffs in terms of the way that election and voter laws get written. In Georgia, for example, Republicans had originally proposed doing away with mail voting for no-excuse absentee voting. They also were thinking of banning voting on Sundays, which is, of course — a lot of the Souls to the Polls programs function on Sundays because that’s when people go to church. And that specifically applies to Black Georgians in particular. Do you understand why Democrats had such a negative response to this bill out of the gate when provisions like that were included?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> And as it went through the process and calmer heads prevailed, thoughtful people spoke into that, what you saw, and they also had a multitude of committee hearings, so that everyone could be heard, including Democrats, and all that stuff that you just mentioned was stripped from the bill and what came out —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> But where are they even going with that?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Well, I think in some cases, they were really filing bills just to placate angry people. But at the end of the day, it never saw the time of day because people realized that we’re not going to go ahead and actually do some of the measures that were proposed.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Do you think that would have disenfranchised people? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR: </strong>Well, we ended up with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-voting-law-9-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more additional days of early voting</a>. We kept Sunday voting available for any county that wants to keep Sunday voting. So now, all 159 counties have to have 17 days of early voting, and any county can have Sunday voting that would like to have that. So that’s actually made it more accessible. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> What was going on there? Are there people in the Republican Party in the state legislature who did set out to try to make it harder for Democrats to vote at the start?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> There were a lot of thoughtful, solid, serious legislators that their voices were brought to bear. And what came through at the end of the day was a solid piece of legislation. And a lot of that other stuff, that chaff, was separated from the solid wheat that was proposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Is that stuff that you would speak out against if it were ever proposed again?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic leaders, activists and strategists spend a lot of time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing — and arguing about — policy</a> under the assumption that the policies the party prioritizes affect whether they will win the next election. It’s been a big part of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/bidens-plan-for-getting-big-things-done.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s governing strategy so far</a>, and one need look no further than Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-2020-autopsy-midterms/2021/05/18/6114af82-b80d-11eb-a5fe-bb49dc89a248_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blaming talk of defunding the police for losses in the House in 2020</a> or, conversely, citing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/politics/health-care-democrats-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health care in the 2018 midterm elections</a> as the reason they did so well to understand the role they think policy plays in their electoral success.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the research on whether choosing the right policy actually helps parties win elections is far less clear. How Democrats talk in 2021 and 2022 and what they prioritize <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/curse-presidents-second-year-biden/620391/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may — or may not — help them win the 2022 midterm elections</a>, but it will shape the policy and political landscape for the future in potentially profound ways. And that, perhaps, is what Democrats should be more worried about.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In political science, there’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716219860108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large body</a> of research that <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2950710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examines</a> how <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716219871222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy shapes politics</a>. The broad takeaway is that <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psj.12328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy matters</a> — <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/when-and-how-new-policy-creates-new-politics-examining-the-feedback-effects-of-the-affordable-care-act-on-public-opinion/D6AB7C1731CC530B5674473642C21E45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot</a> — but not in the ways that political pundits often think it does. Rather than helping parties win the <em>next </em>election, research suggests that major policies remake the political landscape in ways that reverberate far into the future — including changing expectations of government and creating new voter constituencies. This, in turn, can shape future elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although controversial when they were first enacted, social programs like <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Security</a> and <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315133997/politics-medicare-theodore-marmor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medicare</a> are classic examples of this phenomenon; they’ve become so popular and entrenched in our politics that parties perpetually <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/few-americans-support-cuts-to-most-government-programs-including-medicaid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign to protect</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/18/5-facts-about-social-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strengthen them</a>. These programs have also essentially created a new political coalition of <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1022900327448.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retired beneficiaries that actively mobilizes against any threats</a> to them. The survival of those programs is further aided by the fact that retired seniors are largely viewed as a group “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2939044.pdf?casa_token=zXplqaeFvBcAAAAA:j2qsqQFMghbLCYpje-TlkF-MCJYAl1_cV0oiwr81X_kevdZ4rO5xDqPRI3D7pRmrIhyijnVYgJOHXjCJXDzUTUBovrNBoo9kOsV6Y2dHP3ZXbE0kRS0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deserving</a>” of social welfare benefits. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Truly transformative policy has been rarer in recent decades, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan gridlock has stymied ambitious legislation</a>. But with Democrats advancing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-joe-biden-business-environment-medicare-cf3703ba7070447dfae7eca304a0b29d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investments in social spending</a> at levels not seen since former <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/02/how-bidens-economic-plan-compares-to-the-great-society-and-new-deal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society in the 1960s</a>, the potential long-term consequences of major policy changes are once again a key consideration. Those ramifications will almost certainly be more significant than any short-term electoral impacts.</p>

				How Democrats’ Failure To Pass A Voting Rights Bill Fits A Pattern Of Failing Voters Of Color <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-failure-to-pass-a-voting-rights-bill-fits-a-pattern-of-failing-voters-of-color/">Read more. »</a>

<p data-paragraph="main">On this, the Affordable Care Act is instructive. As the most consequential expansion of the social safety net in the 21st century (thus far), it did reshape our politics, but its complicated design and highly partisan implementation mostly just <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-an-ambitious-agenda-heres-what-they-should-learn-from-obamacare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinforced existing political divides</a>, making it harder for new voter constituencies to emerge. Moreover, the government’s role in providing health care benefits was obscured through its patchwork of insurance exchanges. As political scientist Suzanne Mettler has documented in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/opinion/our-hidden-government-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Submerged State</a>,” this is a major design flaw of many government programs: Indirect benefits are very commonplace, which can make it hard for voters to understand the role government plays in the benefits they receive. Policies that feel invisible don’t transform politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, because the Affordable Care Act, with its health exchanges and subsidies and limited sign-up windows, is <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-abstract/43/4/651/134453/After-Defeat-Conservative-Postenactment-Opposition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very complicated</a>, Democrats had a hard time explaining its benefits, while Republicans had an easy time attacking it. This reflects a broader point political scientist Jamila Michener has argued in “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fragmented-democracy/9A69DF1567190EF38883D4766EBC0AAC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragmented Democracy</a>”: Many government benefits are made intentionally difficult to obtain, in a process that’s both bureaucratic and demeaning to those seeking the benefits. That’s especially true for means-tested programs aimed at helping lower-income voters and communities of color, run by Republican-controlled state governments. The consequences, Michener writes, are that recipients think less of the government and become less engaged in politics. Thus, rather than creating new constituencies and clear benefits, many government programs disappear into the ether of anonymity or bolster alienation from the government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In an earlier, more bipartisan era, such policy design choices were arguably the price of political compromise, with Democrats generally more supportive of social spending and Republicans more inclined to change the tax code rather than provide direct subsidies that would require new government agencies. The ACA is illustrative of that. In 2009, when Democrats wrote the bill, they had every intention of getting Republican support and designed a policy around market exchanges to win bipartisan blessing. Twelve years later, leaders in Congress <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bipartisanship-in-the-senate-is-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are far less likely</a> to pursue bipartisanship. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats’ ambitions for social spending — though scaled back over the last several weeks — are still far larger than they have been since the 1960s, largely because they are now liberated from trying to find Republican support. And what’s key here is that many of these programs could create constituencies with beneficiaries, who will become mobilized to sustain the program. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, if implemented, government-funded child care is a benefit that many working parents will come to depend on. It is unlikely to break through in time for the 2022 midterm elections, but over time, it is a benefit that Democrats may be able to campaign on protecting. This would also have been true of free college tuition for community college, another program Democrats contemplated but did <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-abandon-free-community-college-white-house-warns-social-safety-n1281939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not include in the latest round of negotiations</a>. Policies like these — if designed to be clear, easy to access and visibly associated with government — stand a real chance of assembling durable, supportive coalitions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the shorter-term risk is that any new government program yields an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716219862511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immediate backlash</a>. It’s far easier for opponents to play up the costs and demonize the program when no voters have come to rely on the benefits. Moreover, since many social spending programs are likely to benefit communities of color, Republican opposition is likely to play on racial tropes, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00577.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as it did with the ACA</a> and other social programs before that.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/guess-americans-democrats-spending-bill-80782414</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The potential electoral risk is why some Democrats and Democratic strategists want the party to <a href="https://www.vox.com/22338417/james-carville-democratic-party-biden-100-days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus more on bread-and-butter issues, like economic policy.</a> The concern is that if Democrats make race and racial justice too much of their agenda, they risk <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4330.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alienating voters</a>, especially white voters without a college degree, who are geographically important. But what this misses is that Republican messaging is going to focus on <a href="https://gen.medium.com/shor-is-mainly-wrong-about-racism-which-is-to-say-about-electoral-politics-77692910255c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contentious conflicts over race and identity</a> regardless of what Democrats do. So if the Biden administration and Democratic Party leaders think they can duck having these conversations, they are mistaken, especially <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/01/24/u-s-media-polarization-and-the-2020-election-a-nation-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given that a few outlets exercise a stranglehold over the media ecosystem on the political right</a>. Moreover, spending on expanded social programs might actually help Democrats win over some of these voters in the long run, especially since they tend to be lower-income and are also <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/on-the-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to be women</a>, who would benefit most directly from free child care.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even adopting such programs doesn’t mean Democrats will win the messaging wars of 2022 — or even 2024. Midterm elections generally go against the party in power. And arguably, for at least the next two election cycles, the basic rules of who can vote and how votes are counted will be far, far more consequential. Social spending policy, by contrast, is unlikely to have a huge effect on 2022 — even if Democrats do pass popular programs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some backlash is inevitable; even policies that eventually poll well take time to become popular because voters must experience them and actually value them. Partisanship is also sticky and slow to change. Most voters evaluate policy and programs through partisan media and judge programs by whether the programs are <em>Democratic </em>programs or <em>Republican </em>programs. But on the margins — and especially over time — policies shape both identities and party coalitions. Citizens recognize the policies they support or oppose as part of who they are, and the policies and issues that different parties “own” in the present can shape the terrain of future elections. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abortion is one of the thorniest political issues in America, and it’s been that way for years. But it’s also an area where Americans’ views are complex and often contradictory. What people really think about abortion access is notoriously difficult to capture in a poll. And how people feel about the issue is influenced by all kinds of hard-to-quantify factors — their own personal experiences, the political landscape and more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So we want to capture some of that complexity by talking to you. Think you have a perspective on abortion that’s not represented in the news? Believe we should be talking or thinking about abortion differently? Not sure when you think abortion should be legal or under what circumstances? Fill out the form below to tell us a little about your perspective on abortion, and we might follow up to hear more.</p>

			<title>Americans Don’t Trust Their Congressional Maps To Be Drawn Fairly. Can Anything Change That?</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The United States is in the middle of a once-in-a-decade process: redistricting. And although it’s early yet — 19 states aren’t expected to finalize their maps until next year — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of states have proposed maps</a>, and there are debates happening all across the country over which ones to pass. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/?cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six states have finalized maps</a>.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. on Oct. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Americans aren’t necessarily confident that the process will be a fair one. Just 16 percent of U.S. adults said they thought their states’ congressional maps would be drawn fairly, while 44 percent said they thought the maps would be drawn unfairly, per an August <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/83q2toal17/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Economist poll</a>. Another 40 percent of adults said they were unsure if the maps will be fair. That might be one reason why independent commissions, which aim to empower ordinary citizens to draw map lines, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mo-state-wire-ut-state-wire-supreme-courts-wa-state-wire-ia-state-wire-4d2e2aea7e224549af61699e51c955dd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have grown in use</a> since the last redistricting cycle. In that same YouGov/Economist poll, 50 percent of Americans said they thought independent commissions should be responsible for the redistricting process in their state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s unclear whether independent commissions will be enough to help build trust in the redistricting process. For some, the redistricting process is simply “the most political activity in American politics,” according to Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College and author of “Redistricting and Gerrymandering in North Carolina: Battlelines in the Tar Heel State.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Bitzer doesn’t see that changing anytime soon.</p>



<h2><strong>The problem</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many Americans think maps that intentionally favor one party is a serious issue in U.S. elections. According to an <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/public-supportive-of-many-voting-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP-NORC</a> poll conducted in March, 67 percent of Americans thought that states drawing such maps was a “major problem.” In fact, respondents to that survey thought gerrymandering was a bigger problem than disenfranchisement or voter fraud. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting has been a problem in a number of states, to the extent that the court has had to intervene. According to the nonpartisan redistricting website <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Court%20Action&amp;level=Congress&amp;cycle=2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All About Redistricting</a>, the courts rejected all or part of the maps in five states and drew new maps in 12 other states. And there is already <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Plan%20Status&amp;level=Congress&amp;cycle=2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one lawsuit pending this year</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In states like North Carolina, where gerrymandering has particularly been an issue, trust in the redistricting process is extremely low. In the past decade, the state has had to draw its congressional districts three different times. After the initial drawing in 2011, the courts found in a 2016 ruling that the state’s map had been racially gerrymandered to disadvantage Black voters in the state, a decision that was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/north-carolina-gerrymandering/527592/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upheld by the Supreme Court</a>. Following the lower court’s decision, Public Policy Polling found in a 2017 survey that <a href="https://democracync.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NorthCarolinaRedistrictingPollResults2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86 percent of North Carolina voters</a> were either “somewhat” or “very” concerned about the effect of partisan politics on the state’s maps. Then, in 2019, a state court panel threw out North Carolina’s 2016 map because it was ruled <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/court-throws-out-north-carolina-s-congressional-district-maps-n1073081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a partisan gerrymander</a> that gave Republicans an upper hand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bitzer stressed that perceptions of fairness in states like North Carolina have a lot to do with the political nature of the process. “Then you also add in the hyper-partisanship, the intense polarization and the lack of trust from one side of the political aisle to the other — I think all of those factors come together and probably make us even more intensely cynical, more intensely questioning the process of redistricting.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even North Carolina’s third map, drawn ahead of the 2020 election, wasn’t entirely fair — we found in our analysis, for instance, that the median district in the state was still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/north-carolinas-new-house-map-hands-democrats-two-seats-but-it-still-leans-republican/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 points more Republican-leaning than the state as a whole</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Why ensuring a fair map is so hard</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s difficult, though, for states, like North Carolina to rectify unfair maps. That’s because in 2019, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court ruled</a> that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/27/731847977/supreme-court-rules-partisan-gerrymandering-is-beyond-the-reach-of-federal-court?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan gerrymandering is a political question</a> that the federal courts can’t resolve. This has meant that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states</a> get to determine whether a map is fair or unfair — and that process can vary a lot depending on the state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/02/wisconsin-gerrymandering-case-dismissed-after-high-court-ruling/1634244001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a panel of federal judges</a> threw out a partisan gerrymandering case in Wisconsin involving the state’s 2011 map following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision, leaving that map in place. Wisconsin is now, of course, redrawing its map, but given that the government is divided — the governor is a Democrat, but Republicans control the state legislature — and there are already <a href="https://www.wpr.org/democrats-file-first-wisconsin-2021-redistricting-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two lawsuits</a> over <a href="https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-legislature-asks-us-supreme-court-intervene-federal-redistricting-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the redistricting process</a>, it’s possible that the courts will need to draw the lines if Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on a map.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s why in some states, voters are trying to address redistricting themselves in the form of independent redistricting commissions.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/adam-schiff-worried-american-democracy-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80716056</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Independent commissions are designed to keep partisan politics out of the redistricting process by putting the power to draw lines in the hands of ordinary citizens — although in some states, these commissions comprise a bipartisan group of lawmakers. And research has found that independent commissions can improve voters’ trust in the redistricting process. For instance, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bSI442jvLJrndLT6waMZ_48QyrAobqxn/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers at the University of Southern California</a> found that when California voters were told the state uses independent commissions (which it does) and the process was explained to them, 73 percent of respondents thought the process was fair. But when they were told the state legislature draws the lines (which it doesn’t) just 32 percent thought the process was fair.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[T]he ability to explain to voters how [commissions] actually work might improve their perceptions of trust, and it definitely improves their perceptions of fairness,” said Christian Grose, a political science professor at USC and co-author of the paper.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2010, just <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Institution&amp;level=Congress&amp;cycle=2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four states</a> had an independent commission of citizens, but that total is now <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Institution&amp;level=Congress&amp;cycle=2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight</a> in the 2020 redistricting cycle.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1246" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wilkes.redistricting-perceptions.1026-.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wilkes.redistricting-perceptions.1026-.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wilkes.redistricting-perceptions.1026-.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wilkes.redistricting-perceptions.1026-.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In states like Colorado and Michigan, voters led the charge in 2018 for independent redistricting commissions by approving the creation of such bodies by resounding margins: In Colorado, <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/11/06/colorado-amendment-y-z-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71 percent</a> of voters supported the commission, and <a href="https://mielections.us/election/results/2018GEN_CENR.html#90000002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Michigan</a>, 61 percent supported the commission.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet it’s possible that independent commissions aren’t a panacea for the lack of faith in the redistricting process. In March, just 41 percent of Michigan voters said they <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/micrc/MICRC_Market_Research_722339_7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a positive view of the state’s commission</a>, according to a survey conducted the Glengariff Group. And the Colorado <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/final_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commission’s map</a> will likely displease Democrats, as it opens the possibility of a 4-4 Democratic-Republican seat split in a state that has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trended reliably blue in recent years</a> — even though the map is better than the old map in that it encourages more competitive elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a risk The Atlantic’s Russell Berman <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/democrats-redistricting-gerrymandering-majority-midterms/620403/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out earlier this month</a>. Democrats, in particular, have long advocated for more independent commissions, but better governance is often at odds with political gain. And of course, Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will draw 2.5 times as many maps as Democrats</a> in the 2020 redistricting cycle. Meanwhile, states with independent commissions or split partisan control will be responsible for drawing lines in just 38 percent of districts. But even if the playing field were more level, it’s not clear that voters would trust the redistricting process more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Bitzer told me, voters’ perceptions of a fair map often boils down to their own partisan leanings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They will know if something is fair or unfair by how many Republicans get elected, how many Democrats get elected and what their political party affiliations [are],” Bitzer said. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Sen. Joe Manchin told reporters Wednesday that <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/10/senator-joe-manchin-democratic-party-exit-plan-biden-infrastructure-deal-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggestions he would leave the Democratic Party</a> were <a href="https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1450888630977892357?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“bullshit” with a “capital B.”</a> He’d previously <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/21/1048121435/manchin-says-he-offered-to-change-political-parties-if-he-was-a-problem-for-dems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Democratic leaders</a> that <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/577764-exclusive-manchin-says-hes-not-leaving-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’d consider becoming an independent</a> if they felt it would help them explain to the public why the party was having such a hard time coming to an agreement on its social spending plans, but he denied that he’d made threats about leaving the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what if Manchin <em>did</em> leave the Democratic Party? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A Manchin exit would undoubtedly scramble the status quo — Democrats control the Senate only because of Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote — and it could even give Republicans control if Manchin caucused with them. But considering Manchin is often <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at loggerheads with his party</a>, it’s not that wild an idea that he might abandon the Democrats and run as an independent in deep red West Virginia. After all, the move might make electoral sense for him if he decides to run again in 2024. But at the same time, if Manchin did switch parties, it would, more likely than not, mean an immediate loss of clout for him in Congress, which is perhaps the biggest reason Manchin is likely to stay put. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For starters, party switches are actually rare. Since 1951, just 34 sitting members of Congress have switched parties (four did so twice, for a total of 38 switches). And as the table below shows, most members who switched parties still ran for reelection or another office after changing their partisan stripes.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Electoral calculations seem to have guided many of these members’ decisions to change parties, too. In his <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/crossing-the-aisle/519F5A3C501380C42ABB4B1E041DC946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study of party switchers</a>, political scientist Antoine Yoshinaka found that members were more likely to switch parties when they represented areas where their old party performed poorly — though they were most likely to switch if they intended on seeking a higher office in the future. However, troublingly for Manchin, Yoshinaka didn’t find that these switches necessarily paid off. In fact, he found party-switchers performed 4 to 9 percentage points <em>worse</em> in their next general election than non-switchers between 1952 and 2010. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Manchin might be better off if he left the Democratic Party and ran as an independent. It will just be really hard for Manchin to win otherwise. Only Wyoming voted more Republican than West Virginia <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i</a>n the <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2020&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 presidential election</a>. And despite a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-it-was-a-blue-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blue wave in the 2018 midterm elections</a>, Manchin <a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/WV/92360/Web02-state.222648/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won reelection</a> by his slimmest margin yet — about 3 points. Moreover, running as a Republican isn’t really an option for Manchin. It’s true that he scores well among Republican voters in West Virginia — a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/04/sinema-manchin-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> recently found 44 percent approved of him — but he would undoubtedly have a challenging time winning a GOP primary, having <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=117&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to impeach former President Donald Trump</a> in February. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">So there’s clearly some appeal for Manchin to run as an independent, as he would avoid having to run in a GOP primary while also shedding the national Democratic Party label that’s become toxic to many West Virginians. But this formula is no guarantee of success, as it could easily be upset if a more liberal Democrat ran as the Democratic standard-bearer and garnered a decent chunk of the Democratic vote, likely ensuring a GOP victory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet while one can make a fairly convincing electoral case for why Manchin should consider switching parties, it’s most likely he’ll stay where he is considering the enormous amount of leverage he has. He essentially can <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/joe-manchin-democratic-bill-3-trillion-climate-provisions/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veto any proposal he disagrees with</a> while also working within his party to adjust legislation to better reflect what he wants. And because Democrats have full control of government, he’s more likely to get laws passed that are agreeable to him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Granted, if Manchin were part of a 51-member Republican caucus, he would wield a similar amount of veto power. But outside of that, it’s unlikely he would be as influential as he is right now. He’d likely lose his post as <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/chair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee</a>, a politically advantageous position for a senator from a state <a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/energy_and_environment/manchins-pushback-against-key-climate-policy-leaves-wv-coal-industry-satisfied-climate-advocates-wanting-answers/article_6e62ecaa-d580-5949-a0de-ccbbeb6f973e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeply invested in the coal industry</a>. And he’d also be unlikely to influence the trajectory of GOP legislation in the way he does as a longstanding member of the Democratic caucus.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible Manchin could leave the Democratic Party while continuing to caucus with it and retain his chairmanship, but a public separation from his party would also strain relationships Manchin has spent years building. At home, for instance, Democratic activists might choose to work against Manchin by backing a more liberal challenger despite the difficulty such a candidate would have in winning. Meanwhile, in Washington, a switch could damage Manchin’s trustworthiness with his Senate colleagues and hinder future cooperation with them. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">All this sounds like a much greater headache than using his current position to get more of what he wants. Moreover, when push comes to shove, leaving the party you’ve belonged to for years is simply very hard to do. Manchin <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/438503-manchin-says-he-supports-collins-reelection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> that his stances on taxes and health care would make it difficult for him to join the GOP, and he’s <a href="https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Senator-Manchin-refutes-speculation-of-a-party-switch--400628491.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed back</a> on <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/19/joe-manchin-interview-trump-franken-podcast-216118/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the idea</a> of <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/01/11/manchin_on_changing_parties_im_a_good_old_west_virginia_conservative_democrat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the Democratic Party</a> many times over the past few years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Long story short, Manchin could switch parties, but it’s unlikely that he will. And in the end, the main result of the party-switching storyline is yet another news clip of Manchin distancing himself from his party, which demonstrates his independence to voters in deep-red West Virginia.</p>]]></description>

	</aside><p data-paragraph="main">This week, Senate Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/politics/voting-rights-filibuster-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked</a> Democrats’ attempts to pass the Freedom to Vote Act — a bill to streamline voting access across the country, reform the redistricting process and bolster the security of voting systems, among other things. Democrats warn that new Republican legislation <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-october-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restricting voting access</a>, along with attempts by former President Trump to overturn the 2020 election, show the vulnerability of the American democratic system and could have grave consequences for the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, we spoke with Adam Schiff, a Democratic representative from California and the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, whose new book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/669172/midnight-in-washington-by-adam-schiff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midnight in Washington: How We Almost Lost Our Democracy and Still Could</a>” addresses why he thinks American democracy is under threat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can read select, lightly edited excerpts below.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Galen Druke, host of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</strong>: How close do you think the United States is to not being a democracy today?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Adam Schiff</strong>: I think we are still very much a democracy, but a lot of the guardrails have come down. Things that we never imagined could happen in this country have happened. It was hard to imagine, post-Watergate, another president of the United States using the Justice Department to protect those who are lying to cover up for him. But that’s what Bill Barr did: in intervening in Roger Stone’s case, someone convicted of lying to Congress and trying to intimidate other witnesses into lying to Congress; by intervening to make the whole case of Mike Flynn go away. But also using that Justice Department to go after the president’s enemies. And of course, the betrayal of that Department of Justice, which is supposed to represent the interests of justice, is only one of innumerable examples. The frequent attacks on the press as the enemy of the people, reportedly trying to raise postal rates on Amazon to punish the Washington Post is using the instruments of state power to censor the press. The flagrant violations of the Hatch Act, the flagrant violations of the Emoluments Clause. … We are still a democracy, but we are also not out of the woods. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: Do you have reason to think that in the future checks on overturning democracy will not hold? Do you think that maybe the Supreme Court would overturn an election? That the United States military would not be on board with the legitimate results of an election? The bad things happened and our system still held. What gives you reason to think it might not hold in the future?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: Well, because we were fortunate in the last election. In a couple of respects, we’re fortunate that Joe Biden won and won handily, and we were fortunate that local and state elections officials did their job and upheld their oaths of office. But those elections officials are being hounded now out of their posts, and replaced with people who would do Donald Trump’s bidding. And where the legal cases brought were frivolous and the lawyers representing the former president were clownish, with hair dye running down their face, we may not be so fortunate the next time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: Why do you think that is? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: Well, I think that is because, again, you know, people like Brad Raffensperger did the right thing. What happens if you have someone in that position that does the wrong thing? What happens if state legislators in Michigan or Pennsylvania this time, adhere to what Donald Trump wants and send a dual slate of electors? What happens if we get to Congress and the Electoral College were tied, and it comes down to a single state, you can imagine the kind of tumult the country would go through, the kind of constitutional crisis we’d be in. So we cannot, I think, take much solace in the fact that the system held, because it barely held.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: Do you think that Americans care about commitment to democracy enough that it will help determine how they vote?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: I’m counting on it. And look, there’s some distressing numbers — talking about polling — distressing numbers of Americans, particularly young Americans, who question whether democracy is the right model. And we’re in a competition not just at home, apparently with where the Republican Party is now, about democracy versus autocracy. But we’re in that competition around the globe. China is advocating what it calls its model that can deliver economic prosperity and law and order. They point to scenes of people climbing on the Capitol building and gouging police as Exhibit A: that democracy can’t maintain order and the economy at the same time. Now, the Chinese model, people need to know, is totalitarianism. And people cannot be lulled into thinking that that’s somehow an alternative to democracy. It isn’t. But around the world, people are questioning whether democracy is the right model. We are in, I think, a struggle not just for the heart and soul of America, but for the heart and soul of people around the world — and with huge consequences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/11/what-you-need-know-about-how-many-americans-condone-political-violence-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About 20 percent of Americans</a> said across a number of surveys that violence is at least a little bit justified if their party did not win the 2020 election. And there was almost no difference between Democrats and Republicans. Of course, the Capitol attack that you’re looking at was amongst Trump supporters. How worried are you about future political violence?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: I’m deeply worried about it. It’s the natural consequence of efforts to cast doubt on the whole elections process. I mean, if you can’t count on the ballot to decide who governs, then you look at other remedies like violence. And so I’m deeply concerned about it. And, you know, the violence was directed at the U.S. Capitol. It may be directed elsewhere — at state capitols, local government. You know, we see around the world dangerous illustrations. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-london-england-eda5b4786c84e68a59de9075efecbcf7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another British parliamentarian stabbed to death</a>. And so this is a terrible trend. You’d be hard pressed to find members of Congress these days that don’t get death threats. And some, like myself, all too regularly. And so yes, it is very much top of mind.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD</strong>: Bright Line Watch, which is a group of academics who studied democracy globally and here in the United States, <a href="http://brightlinewatch.org/still-miles-apart-americans-and-the-state-of-u-s-democracy-half-a-year-into-the-biden-presidency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started polling Americans</a> about their wishes to break up the country based on region. And, you know, this is just an abstract polling question. But a startlingly high number of people responded that they could support breaking up the country. Is that something that you worry about, like amongst lawmakers when you’re talking about this kind of stuff? Do you talk about worries about violence, civil war, breaking up the country? Like, does it get that bad in your mind?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS</strong>: Well, it certainly, you know, has us talking about political violence and being extraordinarily alarmed by the prospect of more political violence. I’m not surprised, frankly, by the polling you mentioned — that an increasing number of Americans look with favor on a breakup of the Union. And that ought to set off alarm bells for us. I think part of what has contributed to that is the fact that the reaction to this virus has been so different from place to place, and you need national unity to conquer this violence. If we don’t get vaccinated, we’re never going to be able to put an end to this virus, and we’re going to have to deal with its consequences and preventable deaths for years and years to come. And I think that has really contributed to the amount of anger among those who are vaccinated towards those who are not vaccinated. And, and exposing, you know, the rest of the country to danger and, and economic damage that results from it, I think, is one of the drivers of this.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">By all appearances, former President Donald Trump is planning to run for president again in 2024. He is <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/09/donald-trump-rally-iowa-state-fairgrounds-schedule-2020-election/6035496001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traveling the country holding rallies</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-with-spate-of-2022-endorsements-goes-where-no-former-presidents-gone-before" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staying involved in internal GOP politics</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-political-committees-raise-82-million-2021/story?id=79194850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising vast amounts of money</a>. Reportedly, he was even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-2024-campaign-candidacy/2021/10/03/73af3b12-21f8-11ec-b3d6-8cdebe60d3e2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the verge of announcing his candidacy</a> this past summer, but advisers talked him out of it to avoid subjecting him to restrictions on fundraising and TV appearances.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if Trump does run, one thing is clear: The Republican nomination would likely be his for the taking. He remains <em>extremely</em> popular among Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University poll</a> conducted Oct. 15-18 found Trump has an 86 percent favorable rating and just a 10 percent unfavorable rating among Republican adults. And he already dominates early polls of the 2024 Republican primary. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/13/trump-2024-pence-desantis-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico survey</a> from Oct. 8-11 found that 47 percent of Republican voters would vote for Trump; no other candidate was above 13 percent. And while you should certainly take such an <em>early</em> primary poll with a grain of salt, if Trump is still polling that high come 2023, it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actually bodes pretty well for his chances of becoming the nominee</a>. Plus, given Trump’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-influence-looms-gop-recapture-congress-2022/story?id=76348665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong influence within the GOP</a>, few other Republican politicians would likely dare to run against him anyway.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A sizable majority of Republicans also actively want Trump to run again. By a 67 percent to 29 percent margin, Republican registered voters told Morning Consult/Politico that Trump should run again, including 51 percent who said he should “definitely” run. A <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/577199-poll-just-under-half-of-voters-support-trump-running-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HarrisX/The Hill poll</a> from Oct. 13-14 similarly found that Republican registered voters supported a third consecutive Trump candidacy 77 percent to 23 percent, including 52 percent who “strongly” supported it. And Quinnipiac found that 78 percent of Republicans would like to see Trump run again, and only 16 percent would not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, as more time passes since the end of his presidency, Republicans may be increasingly eager for Trump’s return. Back <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in May</a>, Quinnipiac found Republicans in favor of a Trump presidential run 66 percent to 30 percent — now it’s 78 percent to 16 percent. And while Morning Consult/Politico does not appear to have asked the question before, they <em>have</em> previously asked whether Trump should “play a major role,” “play a minor role” or “no longer play a role” in the Republican Party. Morning Consult hasn’t found as much support for Trump as Quinnipiac, but in their <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/13064013/2110042_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a>, 63 percent of Republican registered voters said a major role, 19 percent said a minor role and 13 percent said no role. That’s slightly up from 59 percent who wanted him to play a major role in <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/02/16103155/210259_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February</a> (when 18 percent said minor role and 17 percent said no role). However, not every pollster agrees that Republicans’ appetite for more Trump has increased: HarrisX/The Hill found virtually no change from their <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/527236-poll-47-percent-of-voters-support-donald-trump-running-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nov. 17-19, 2020, survey</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/adam-schiff-worried-american-democracy-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80716056</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Despite Republicans’ enthusiasm for a Trump comeback, however, the American electorate as a whole is much cooler on the notion. The latest HarrisX/The Hill poll found that registered voters overall opposed Trump running again, 53 percent to 47 percent. Independents were against the idea 58 percent to 42 percent. The margin was even wider according to Morning Consult/Politico (59 percent to 35 percent, with independents opposed 58 percent to 30 percent) and Quinnipiac (58 percent to 35 percent among both independents and adults overall). Quinnipiac also offered some more inauspicious numbers for the ex-president, such as his 39 percent to 52 percent overall favorable/unfavorable ratings and the fact that Americans felt, 51 percent to 41 percent, that he has had a mainly negative impact on American politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But these underwater numbers don’t mean Trump would be guaranteed to lose the 2024 general election. While it’s definitely too early to hang your hat on any 2024 general-election polls, a <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2021-10/GCNP%20Oct21%20Toplines%20Methodology%20Crosstabs%20v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selzer &amp; Co./Grinnell College poll</a> conducted Oct. 13-17 found that 40 percent of likely 2024 voters would vote for President Biden, and 40 percent of likely 2024 voters would vote for Trump. There’s plenty of time for those numbers to change, of course, but even against an unpopular Trump, no one should assume Biden, should he run again, will win reelection in a landslide.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The Biden administration announced Wednesday <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-announces-vaccine-plan-kids-11-states/story?id=80589544">a plan to vaccinate children age 5 to 11</a>, as the Food and Drug Administration reviews Pfizer and BioNTech’s request for authorization of their COVID-19 vaccine in kids under 12. If the vaccine is authorized, roughly 28 million more children would be eligible. This plan may come as a relief for some parents with kids under 18. Per a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/14/children-coronavirus-vaccines-eligibility-polling/">recent Morning Consult poll</a>, 45 percent of parents said they would get their children vaccinated as soon as they’re eligible.</li><li>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pete-buttigieg-defends-paternity-leave-supply-chain-issues/story?id=80670846">has been criticized</a> for taking paternity leave following the birth of his twins in August, sparking a debate over whether new fathers should be able to take time off work. But public polls suggest more American fathers are taking responsibility for child care. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/">Pew Research Center survey</a> found that in 2016, fathers said they spent an average of 8 hours a week on childcare, up 5.5 hours from 1965. Some fathers might also welcome the opportunity to take paternity leave, as most fathers with children under 18, 63 percent, told Pew they thought they spent too little time with their kids. Moreover, 62 percent of those fathers said work was the reason they didn’t spend enough time with their children.</li><li>The most ambitious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html">part of Biden’s climate plan</a>, a program to replace coal- and gas-fired plants with renewable energy sources, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/18/politics/clean-energy-program-budget-bill-climate/index.html">will likely be cut</a> due to Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition. This move might upset some voters, though. A <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/10/dfp-vox-bbb-oct12-toplines.pdf">Vox/Data for Progress</a> poll found that 63 percent of likely voters support incentives for companies who meet clean-energy performance goals and penalties for those who don’t comply.</li><li>Overall, Americans are split on the extent to which the United States should prioritize the environmental or economic impact of its infrastructure investment. An <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/2021-Global-Infrastructure-Index">Ipsos poll</a> found that 37 percent of Americans said they preferred prioritizing the environment while 34 percent preferred the economy. One thing is clear, though: Satisfaction with U.S. infrastructure is at a five-year low, per Ipsos. Sixty-one percent of Americans agree that “as a country, we are not doing enough to meet our infrastructure needs.”</li><li>For most Black Americans, opposing racism is an essential part of being faithful or moral, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/19/across-religious-groups-a-majority-of-black-americans-say-opposing-racism-is-an-essential-part-of-their-faith/">recent Pew poll</a>. This was especially true among the 67 percent of respondents who said being Black is a very important part of their identity, including Black Americans from different religious backgrounds. Of those who thought being Black was a very important part of their identity, 78 percent said opposing racism was important in their faith and morals. Only 70 percent of those who said that being Black was less important to their identity said the same.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Over his first nine months in office, President Biden <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/23/views-of-biden-and-congressional-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has lost support</a> among Americans of all stripes — men and women, Black voters and white voters, Zoomers and Baby Boomers. Even Democrats writ large are more disenchanted. But two groups with whom Biden has lost support stand out: independents and Hispanics. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/politics/independents-biden-losing-fast/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Independents have soured</a> on Biden to the extent that his approval ratings among this group approach the <a href="https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/trump-job-approval/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=100&amp;mindate=2000-01-01&amp;maxdate=2021-10-19&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=no&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A,A%20-%20D,A%20-%20R,RV,RV%20-%20D,RV%20-%20R,LV,LV%20-%20D,LV%20-%20R&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=approve,disapprove&amp;fudge=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly negative ratings they gave then-President Donald Trump</a> at the same point in his presidency, while increased disapproval of Biden among Hispanics <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/13/biden-is-bleeding-support-hispanic-voters-democrats-should-be-petrified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could signal they are moving further away from Democrats</a> after they <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted somewhat toward Trump and the GOP</a> last November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not that unusual for a president’s approval rating to drop over the course of the first nine months in office. A president’s “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-should-we-expect-of-bidens-approval-rating-in-the-first-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeymoon period</a>” has usually ended by then, as opposition to the president’s agenda coalesces and the new administration’s actions spark criticism. As the chart below shows, most recent presidents have seen their approval ratings fall after their first few months in office, although there have been some notable exceptions.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1036" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.1-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.1-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.1-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.1-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">For instance, Biden, Trump and Barack Obama all experienced clear descents during their first nine months in office, albeit from different starting points: Biden has fallen from the mid-50s to the mid-40s, Obama fell from the mid-to-high 60s to the low 50s, and Trump fell from the mid-40s to the high 30s. But former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush didn’t really follow this pattern. Clinton’s approval rating did <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton-fickle-favours-presidential-popularity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decline a few months into his presidency</a>, but in a possible sign of hope for Biden, Clinton’s approval rating ticked back up after hitting the summer doldrums. Meanwhile, in 2001, Bush’s approval rating didn’t change much until it skyrocketed following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a textbook example of the “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-explains-the-bump-in-trumps-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally-around-the-flag effect</a>.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But our hyperpolarized political environment <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-should-still-pay-attention-to-joe-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could make it challenging</a> for Biden to regain the support he’s lost since taking office. In fact, while Biden’s approval rating has seemingly stabilized in the mid-to-low 40s, there’s also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-approval-rating-isnt-bouncing-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no indication that his approval rating is about to bounce back</a>. And part of that comes down to Biden’s rough numbers among independents and Hispanics, in addition to his standing on important issues like COVID-19 and the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps the most obvious place where Biden has lost support is among independents. Across the polls we collected that measured support by party ID, Biden’s approval has dropped from 50 percent among independents in the late spring and early summer, to below 35 percent now, as the chart below details. His slides among Democrats and Republicans haven’t been nearly as sizable.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1038" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.2-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.2-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.2-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.2-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that Republicans never gave Biden much of a chance and that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-americans-who-identify-as-independent-are-actually-independent-thats-really-bad-for-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most independents lean toward one party</a>, but independents are still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/just-how-many-swing-voters-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more politically malleable</a> than Democrats or Republicans. In that sense, it’s a real problem for Biden that the most moveable group of voters now largely disapproves of the job he is doing as president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s sharp decline among independents also seems related to what has often been Americans’ <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number-one concern</a> since <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/353012/coronavirus-ticks-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden took office</a>: the COVID-19 pandemic. This has surely hurt Biden with most groups of Americans, but independents’ dissatisfaction with Biden’s handling of the pandemic has been particularly pronounced. In early June, almost 60 percent of independents approved of Biden’s response to the coronavirus, but that has now fallen to just below 42 percent, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s coronavirus approval tracker</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1388" height="670" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley_BIDENAPPROVAL_1021_screenshot.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley_BIDENAPPROVAL_1021_screenshot.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley_BIDENAPPROVAL_1021_screenshot.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley_BIDENAPPROVAL_1021_screenshot.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Independents are also especially dissatisfied with how Biden is handling the economy. Granted, this week <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/mzvq4c7ty8/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> found only 41 percent of Americans approved of Biden’s handling of jobs and the economy, while a brand-new <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/20054637/2110084_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult survey</a> found just 41 percent of registered voters approved of his handling of the economy. But this is a drop from where his numbers stood on these issues in early June, when <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/y3gecetbxy/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> polling had him 8 percentage points higher and <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/06/16051615/210691_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult</a> polling had him 6 points higher. Yet independents have been even more displeased with Biden’s handling of the economy, as their approval on that issue fell from the low 40s in June to around 30 percent more recently.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Garnering support from independents is important because it helps a president achieve overall popularity, but support from the base is vital too — and it’s another spot where Biden is in trouble. While his job approval rating among Democrats remains very high, it has dipped from 90 percent in the early summer to the low 80s now, with signs of deteriorating support among Black and Hispanic Americans, who are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to identify as Democratic</a> than white Americans. As the chart below shows, there has been a drop in support for Biden among all three racial and ethnic groups we measured, but the drop among Hispanics — from the high 60s to slightly below 50 percent — marks Biden’s most precipitous decline.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1062" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.3.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skelley.BIDEN-APPROVAL.1021.3.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling suggests that Hispanic approval of Biden’s handling of the pandemic and the economy has fallen sharply. The latest poll from The Economist/YouGov found just 45 percent of Hispanics approved of Biden’s handling of the pandemic, compared with 65 percent in early June. And Politico/Morning Consult’s new survey found Hispanic approval of Biden’s handling of the economy has dropped to 42 percent, compared with 60 percent back in June. Hispanics are also frustrated with how Biden has dealt with immigration — long <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-handling-of-the-pandemic-polls-better-than-his-overall-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Biden’s weakest issues in the public’s eyes</a> — and although it isn’t <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-latino-voters-havent-completely-abandoned-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most important issue for Hispanic voters</a>, it is often a highly salient one. Earlier this month, <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University found</a> that only 23 percent of Hispanic Americans approved of Biden’s work on immigration, down from 49 percent <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in late May</a>. Even if that might be on the low end for Biden, the new Politico/Morning Consult survey also found him performing more poorly on the issue among Hispanic voters, as just 40 percent approved, compared with 51 percent in June.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden has lost ground among almost every single demographic group over the past few months, but independents and Hispanics stick out as two key groups where Biden’s standing has especially faltered. For Democrats looking ahead to the 2022 midterms, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s overall approval rating is concerning enough</a>, but if Biden is struggling to win independents and Hispanics, that could snuff out any hope Democrats have of holding either chamber of Congress. After all, independents backed Democrats <a href="https://medium.com/@yghitza_48326/revisiting-what-happened-in-the-2018-election-c532feb51c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 2018 midterms</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden last November</a>, and even though Republicans made gains with Hispanics in places like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas’s Rio Grande Valley</a>, Hispanics still largely backed Biden and helped him win in key swing states, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Elections/arizona-exit-polls-2020-us-presidential-election-results-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Arizona</a>. But if Republicans can capitalize on Biden’s weakness among these groups, that could be their ticket back to controlling Congress next year.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Before President Biden entered the White House, he had an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/biden-promises-100-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressive list of to-dos</a> on his agenda, including but not limited to: passing federal voting rights legislation, restructuring policing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-has-and-hasnt-changed-since-george-floyd-was-murdered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the murder of George Floyd</a> and creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But these three agenda items have another thing in common: None have passed Congress yet. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today,<strong> </strong>Democrats (again) attempted to pass <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-republicans-defeat-voting-rights-reform-bill/story?id=80643465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a compromise version of a voting rights bill</a>, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-wont-support-sweeping-voting-rights-legislation-now-or-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans rejected</a> it (again). Police reform <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/year-george-floyds-killing-congress-agree-police-reform/story?id=80188065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met a similar fate</a> in September. And earlier that month, Democrats faced another setback after the Senate parliamentarian excluded a pathway for citizenship for immigrants <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/senate-parliamentarian-sets-back-dems-immigration-push-80117636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the upcoming reconciliation bill</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, in a highly polarized Congress, it was always likely that not <em>all </em>of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democratic-priorities-will-make-it-through-congress-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s priorities would pass</a>. But the current failure of these three measures in particular — all of which disproportionately affect people of color — poses a real problem for the Biden administration, especially given that part of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/bidens-plan-for-getting-big-things-done.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his political strategy</a> has been to pass popular legislation. It raises the question: popular for whom?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/public-supportive-of-many-voting-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All three</a> of these bills that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/315962/americans-say-policing-needs-major-changes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed Congress</a> are at least <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/7/dfp_immigration_pathway.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat popular</a> with American voters, but they’re also the Democrats’ agenda items that most explicitly tackle race. As such, their fate hangs in limbo, in part, because some Democrats — including Biden — have long struggled <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-is-unlikely-to-talk-meaningfully-about-race-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to meaningfully address race-related issues</a> for fear of alienating white voters. Some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-falling-poll-numbers-georgia/2021/10/10/3606c99e-2002-11ec-8200-5e3fd4c49f5e_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting already suggests that</a> Black voters in Georgia aren’t pleased with Biden’s presidency, and because polls show his approval rating slipping <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/23/views-of-biden-and-congressional-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among key Democratic constituencies</a>, Democrats face a big risk if they don’t deliver on promises they made, particularly those to voters of color. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one, we’re already seeing the effects of Biden’s and Congress’s inaction on certain reforms. Polling from the Pew Research Center shows that Biden’s favorability has already dropped with most voting blocs — including Democrats. Among Democrats and those who lean Democratic, Biden’s approval rating fell from 88 percent in July to 75 percent in September. And among Black and Hispanic Americans, there was a steeper decline. Eighty-five percent of Black adults approved of Biden in July, but this fell to only 67 percent by September; during the same timeframe, Biden’s numbers among Hispanic adults tumbled from 72 percent to 56 percent. His support among Asian Americans also dropped from 68 percent to 54 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other polls show a similar decline among voters of color. Per an October <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/14/biden-black-voters-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult survey</a>, Biden’s net approval rating among Black voters slipped from 68 percent on Aug. 1 to 43 percent by Oct. 12. And among Hispanic voters, whom Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/13/biden-is-bleeding-support-hispanic-voters-democrats-should-be-petrified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already struggling with</a>, an early October poll from The Economist/YouGov found that <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/j46zs8picp/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a narrow majority</a> (51 percent) saw the president in a favorable light.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, we don’t know why voters of color and Democrats writ large have begun to see Biden less favorably. His approval numbers <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began slipping before September</a>, in part because of the spread of the highly contagious delta variant and because of his administration’s handling of the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. Other surveys note that Biden’s <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/22/biden-black-voters-vaccine-mandate-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal vaccine mandate</a> didn’t go over too well with unvaccinated Black voters, either. But it’s notable that the policies that are now slipping through the cracks are the ones that will have the most obvious impact on people of color, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who lean Democratic</a> and have been a reliable source of support for Biden. It’s also too early to know whether voters of color will negatively judge Biden for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-abandon-free-community-college-white-house-warns-social-safety-n1281939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting tuition-free community college</a> from Democrats’ reconciliation bill, but <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/11/democrats-overwhelmingly-favor-free-college-tuition-while-republicans-are-divided-by-age-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew found</a> that making tuition at public colleges and universities free was overwhelmingly popular with Black (86 percent), Hispanic (82 percent) and Asian American (69 percent) voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats will blame Republican obstructionism for why legislation on voting rights, immigration and police reform have failed so far. And of course, there is disagreement among Democrats — namely, moderate Sens. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kyrsten-sinema-is-confounding-her-own-party-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyrsten Sinema</a> of Arizona and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Manchin</a> of West Virginia — on how much of Biden’s agenda should pass, including whether to abolish or alter the filibuster so that Democrats can pass more of their priorities. But because Democrats control the White House and Congress, it might be hard for them to persuade voters, particularly voters of color, that the president has done everything in his power to deliver meaningful change since getting into office — a point that Cleve R. Wootson Jr. of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-falling-poll-numbers-georgia/2021/10/10/3606c99e-2002-11ec-8200-5e3fd4c49f5e_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a> argued earlier this month.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On voting rights specifically, there’s a clear racial divide on its importance. According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/22/wide-partisan-divide-on-whether-voting-is-a-fundamental-right-or-a-privilege-with-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July report from Pew</a>, Black (77 percent), Hispanic (63 percent) and Asian Americans (66 percent) were all far more likely than white Americans (51 percent) to label voting a fundamental right rather than a privilege with responsibilities. In June, a separate <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/06/09050746/210636_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_LM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> found that Black Americans (64 percent) were significantly more likely than Hispanic and white Americans (47 percent each) to think restricting voting access was a major threat to American democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, the Biden administration’s current failure to pass bills that would help people of color isn’t that surprising, since Democrats have long struggled on how best to address race and racism. But ignoring these issues — or letting them fail completely — could have negative impacts on Democrats in the near- and long-term future. As Wootson Jr. notes, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-is-unlikely-to-talk-meaningfully-about-race-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we’ve written previously</a>, some voters of color already feel taken for granted by the Biden administration, and further policy failures might give voters of color yet another reason not to turn out for Democrats in the future.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Everyone keeps waiting for the Supreme Court’s big right turn — especially this year. The justices have now begun their first full term with a 6-3 conservative majority, and the docket is full of culture-war issues, such as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/26/990846329/supreme-court-to-take-up-first-major-gun-rights-case-in-more-than-a-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gun rights</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/02/1012586995/the-supreme-court-will-hear-a-case-on-the-funding-of-religious-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religious liberty</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in many ways, the Supreme Court’s conservative revolution is already here: The court hasn’t been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-unusually-big-jump-to-the-right-might-look-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this ideologically tilted</a> in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/politics/supreme-court-conservative/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost 100 years</a>. Capturing the full breadth of this shift is difficult because the metrics we use to measure the court’s ideology are driven by hard-to-track factors like the types of cases the court takes up. For the first time in decades, too, a single justice isn’t holding the reins. The conservative justices can now assemble a majority more easily, giving them the power to push the court even further right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That power may take some adjusting to — for both the public and the justices. The past term showed that there will still be plenty of room for disagreement on the precise path forward. One example was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-has-carved-out-one-religious-exemption-after-another-the-next-may-be-a-blow-to-lgbtq-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a high-profile religious liberty case</a> where the most conservative justices <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/17/alito-supreme-court-trump-495121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took their fellow GOP appointees to task</a> for issuing a ruling they saw as too timid. And the main priority of the liberal justices, now distinctly in the minority, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/supreme-court-breyer-sotomayor-kagan/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared to be damage control</a>. Moreover, some big decisions were taking place outside the public eye.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Right now, I see two courts in action,” said <a href="https://www.epstein.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee Epstein</a>, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies the Supreme Court. “We see a standard Roberts court that leans conservative but has a serious amount of consensus and tries to look pretty nonpartisan. Then, within that court, we have an aggressive, socially conservative court led by the three Trump appointees plus [Justice Clarence] Thomas and [Justice Samuel] Alito.” Epstein told us that was likely why the justices decided to hear two extremely high-profile cases on abortion and gun rights this term — a signal that at least some conservative justices thought they now had the numbers to push the law to the right on those issues. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We don’t know how those cases will come out, of course, but the justices don’t have to overturn Roe this year for the court to still be deeply conservative. Friction among the conservatives isn’t necessarily a sign that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/supreme-court-conservative-shift-hits-bump-with-moderate-rulings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court is moderating</a>; it may simply take time for the GOP-appointed justices to work out their plans for the enormous amount of power they now wield. Life tenure grants them plenty of space to hash out these differences. This means we need to start watching the court in new ways — and stop waiting for the justices to suddenly accomplish all of conservatives’ legal goals at once. It’s the overall trajectory of the court that matters, and there’s no sign that it will disappoint conservatives in the long term.</p>



<h2><strong>The court is already very conservative</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s get one thing out of the way: This is a very conservative Supreme Court. According to the <a href="http://scdb.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court Database</a>, 60 percent of all decisions last term went in a conservative direction, as well as 59 percent of close decisions — which is to say, decisions in which the minority side had three or four votes. That makes the court’s previous term the most conservative term since 2008, just three years after John Roberts <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/29/roberts.nomination/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assumed his seat as chief justice</a>.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="The Supreme Court's previous term was very conservative" aria-label="Interactive area chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CvTLa/23/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Early in the Roberts years, the court was seen as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/us/25roberts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most conservative in decades</a>. After Roberts and <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5181091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alito</a> were nominated by then-President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate, the court issued a slew of highly conservative rulings, deciding to uphold <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2007/06/06/the-high-court-upholds-the-federal-partial-birth-abortion-ban-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ban on second-trimester abortions</a>, to include <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/27/washington/27scotus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an individual right to bear arms</a> as a part of the Second Amendment and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut the Voting Rights Act</a>, freeing states with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices to change their election laws without federal approval. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That pattern shifted somewhat abruptly around 2012. The share of cases that went in a conservative direction dropped below half in the 2013 and 2014 terms, and then hovered around 50 percent until last term, when the share of conservative court decisions skyrocketed. And this time the court’s sudden lurch to the right may last, as the court appears to be hearing increasingly conservative cases. </p>

</div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The court is asked to hear <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/reportersguide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thousands of cases each year</a>, which makes it very difficult to know whether the kinds of questions the justices are asked to contemplate are changing — if, for example, conservative legal advocates have begun bringing more cases that directly attack liberal precedents. There also isn’t any data to help us look for patterns in the pool of cases the court can pick from — or in the cases it ends up taking.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the court’s docket seems to be shifting, according to several legal experts we spoke with. <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/clark-tom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Clark</a>, a political scientist at Emory University who studies the judiciary, pointed to the fact that the justices agreed to hear a gun rights case for the first time in over a decade as evidence. “That’s not a case [the conservatives] take unless they think they can win,” he said.</p>



<h2><strong>But the conservative justices might still disagree with each other</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">That the court is increasingly tilting to the right, however, does not mean that the justices will deliver conservative victories on every high-profile issue — or that they’ll be unified about the best approach. Now that they have a solid six-justice majority, the GOP appointees have a new luxury or a new challenge, depending on how you look at it: They can disagree with each other. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because for the first time in decades we’re not in a situation where a single swing justice controls the court. Instead, several justices are bunched together around the median.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1252" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ATD-bronner.SCOTUS-REVOLUTION.1020.2stepchart.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ATD-bronner.SCOTUS-REVOLUTION.1020.2stepchart.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ATD-bronner.SCOTUS-REVOLUTION.1020.2stepchart.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ATD-bronner.SCOTUS-REVOLUTION.1020.2stepchart.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Epstein said that between 2005 and 2017, when Justice Anthony Kennedy was the median justice, it was easier to foresee where the court would come down on a specific issue because in many cases where he was the deciding justice, his ideology was well-known. Similarly, when Roberts took over the role of swing justice around 2018, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roberts-is-the-new-swing-justice-that-doesnt-mean-hes-becoming-more-liberal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he appeared to take a more moderate stance</a> in cases where the court’s institutional reputation was at stake. But now there are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-might-have-three-swing-justices-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several potential “swing” justices</a>. To produce an outcome that sides with the liberal justices, it now takes <em>two</em> conservative justices to defect in close cases. This makes it much harder to predict how the court will rule.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And fissures among the conservative justices could lead to some unpredictable and confusing outcomes. Consider the rate at which the justices joined the majority opinion last term. Even with a conservative majority, the GOP-appointed justices weren’t on the same page about every decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you look at how often each justice agreed fully with the majority opinion in close cases — which is to say, they signed onto the opinion without writing their own separate opinion outlining different reasoning or a disagreement — two factions among the conservatives emerge.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Agreement-7.2.21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to SCOTUSBlog&lt;/a&gt;, “Full agreement is defined as two justices joining the same opinion(s) in all parts, without writing separately,” and “Partial agreement is defined as two justices joining at least part of the same opinion, even if one writes separately.” A justice’s partial agreement score includes the share of opinions they agreed with fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a> Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett are in one camp, much likelier to be in full agreement with the majority opinion. While Justices Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Thomas are far less in step. In fact, Thomas had the lowest rate of full agreement of any of the justices, including the liberal justices.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, this picture shifts when we look at the number of times that justices <em>partially</em> agreed with the majority opinion — which is to say, they joined at least part of the opinion but might have written a separate opinion outlining a different perspective. Thomas is still somewhat of an outlier among the conservative justices, with an agreement rate of 50 percent, but Gorsuch and Alito’s agreement rate jumps very close to the other Republican appointees. That signals that Gorsuch and Alito weren’t fully at loggerheads with their fellow conservatives about the outcome in many close cases, though they still disagreed about some component of the majority opinion’s reasoning. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is why each justice’s perspective on specific issues could matter more in the upcoming term; their ability to persuade each other will be key, too. Take abortion rights. Five of the conservative justices may agree that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 opinion that established a constitutional right to abortion, should be overturned, but that wouldn't mean they’d be on the same page about <em>how</em> to do it. And that makes a difference for how far-reaching the court’s rulings will be. For instance, when it comes to abortion, the justices may end up with a compromise ruling that narrows the constitutional right to abortion without getting rid of it entirely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, that’s still bad news for the liberal justices. They’re likely to find themselves compromising a lot more since, ultimately, the conservatives are in the drivers’ seat. Clark pointed out that when Roberts was nominated to the Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/20/politics/politicsspecial1/in-pursuit-of-conservative-stamp-president.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he was criticized</a> as a Republican partisan and likely foe of abortion rights. “Now, he could end up in the minority of a case overturning Roe v. Wade,” Clark said. “That’s how conservative the court is right now.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The question, he added, isn’t whether liberals will lose on big cases — it’s how badly they will lose. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that can be a tricky thing to track because what looks like consensus among the justices may be the liberal justices moderating their stances in the hopes of keeping the conservative justices from going too far. That appears to have been what happened in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/us/supreme-court-gay-rights-foster-care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that religious liberty case from last term</a>. The decision was ostensibly unanimous, but in reality, the court was split. In that case, the liberal justices “won” by preserving the status quo — a dynamic that might persist in future terms. </p>



<h2><strong>Some important decisions are happening outside the public eye</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Increasingly, too, the justices are making big decisions without fully explaining their reasoning, through cases that have emerged through the court’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/politics/supreme-court-shadow-docket-texas-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shadow docket</a>,” where <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/supreme-court-shadow-docket.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the justices are asked to rule quickly</a>, without the extensive legal briefing or oral arguments that happen in normal Supreme Court cases. Sometimes, these orders are only one sentence long. And the justices don’t have to say how they voted or why.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Normally, <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1961&amp;context=public_law_and_legal_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this swiftness and secrecy</a> isn’t especially newsworthy because the rulings that come out of the shadow docket just aren’t that significant. But that has changed in recent years. Some of the court’s biggest rulings in the past year — including its decision to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-california-coronavirus-church/2021/04/10/182faec2-99e8-11eb-962b-78c1d8228819_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strike down COVID-19 restrictions</a> on religious gatherings and its decision to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/-shadow-docket-use-in-supreme-court-abortion-ruling-fuels-angst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow a highly restrictive abortion law to go into effect in Texas</a> — came out of the shadow docket. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The shadow docket is very difficult to track, for obvious reasons — it’s hard to know what the justices are even doing. But scholars like <a href="https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/stephen-i-vladeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Vladeck,</a> a law professor at the University of Texas-Austin, have found evidence that the Supreme Court’s use of the shadow docket has changed over the past few years. For instance, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Vladeck-SCOTUS-Commission-Testimony-06-30-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to data collected by Vladeck</a>, the number of cases in which the justices changed the legal status quo — for example, lifting an injunction imposed by a lower court — used to be very low, numbering in the single digits each year. That has changed recently, though. In the 2019 term, the court disrupted the status quo in 19 shadow-docket cases, and the same thing happened in 17 shadow docket cases in last year’s term.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What we don’t know is why this is happening or how this fits into the broader ideological shifts on the court. And that’s a big problem for making sense of what little data we do have. Many of the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/24/supreme-court-nevada-covid-rules-can-favor-casinos-over-churches/5454128002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shadow-docket rulings</a> that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/28/928890290/supreme-court-allows-ballot-extensions-in-pennsylvania-north-carolina-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made news</a> did <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/bidens-supreme-court-losses-prompt-more-shadow-docket-scrutiny-2021-08-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split along ideological lines</a>. But what these decisions mean for the overall tilt of the court is much harder to say.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those examples suggest that the Supreme Court — which was already quite conservative — has recently transformed into an even more ideologically extreme body. And to understand what the court is doing, we need to stop relying on outdated ways of thinking about the justices. We aren’t in the land of a single swing justice anymore. Now, a more complex negotiation among the conservative justices will determine the outcome in important cases. There is a distinct possibility that we are heading into a blockbuster term with some significant victories for the conservatives, too. But more than anything, this term will tell us a lot about <em>how</em> the conservatives intend to move forward — because it’s pretty clear already what direction they’re heading.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-us-capitol-riot-no-responsibility-03eccd4b09d7acb6f5cce304a0afdf42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first public appearance</a> after the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-what-led-to-the-attack-on-the-capitol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack on the U.S. Capitol</a>, then-President Donald Trump sought respite in South Texas. His visit was billed as a way to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/09/donald-trump-texas-rio-grande-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico</a>, but it also gave him a welcome escape from the turmoil in Washington. That’s because, just months prior, voters in Texas’s border region <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/05/us/texas-election-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted sharply toward Trump</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Trump isn’t the only Republican to see success in South Texas. In June, Javier Villalobos, a former Hidalgo County GOP chair, <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2021/06/08/texas-republicans-celebrate-mayoral-win-in-mcallen-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly bested Veronica Vela Whitacre</a> in a McAllen municipal election. Though the race was technically nonpartisan, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/11/texas-republicans-mcallen-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local GOP officials insisted</a> Villalobos was the first registered Republican elected mayor of the city this century. “The macro realignment accelerates in South Texas, and elsewhere, as Hispanics rally to America First,” former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes <a href="https://twitter.com/CortesSteve/status/1401506899602907138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted at the time</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s why Republicans, headed into the 2022 midterms, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/10/2022-texas-congressional-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan to campaign in the area more heavily</a> now than they did before. Moreover, through the redistricting process, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which Republicans control</a> in Texas, they have positioned themselves to hold a sizable and long-term majority of House seats, including by making it easier to win <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-congressional-map-could-give-a-huge-boost-to-gop-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least one border-area district</a> currently represented by a Democrat. Whether Republicans will continue to make inroads in the Texas counties along or near the border is unclear — there is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/11/17/trump-latinos-south-texas-tejanos-437027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflicting evidence</a> over <a href="https://www.vox.com/21551025/latino-national-vote-biden-trump-2020-florida-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just how much</a> Hispanic voters moved toward the GOP in 2020 — but if Republicans are successful there, it might not mean a death knell for Democrats hoping to turn Texas blue. That’s because Democrats have made sizable gains in the Texas suburbs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The state as a whole has <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2012/sep/26/texas-democrats-have-lost-statewide-elections-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long voted reliably Republican</a>, but about two-thirds of Texas’s population lives in one of the state’s four huge metropolitan areas — Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. If you combine all the votes there, Democrats improved their margin by more than 5 percentage points between 2016 and 2020, carrying these areas 52 percent to 47 percent in November. This shift is significant because even though Texas’s border counties moved sharply to the right in 2020 — Starr County, for instance, swung a staggering 55 points toward Republicans — Democrats’ gains in those four big cities and their suburbs added almost five times as many votes as Republicans’ gains in 28 counties along or near Texas’s border with Mexico.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewster, Brooks, Cameron, Culberson, Dimmit, Duval, El Paso, Frio, Hidalgo, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kinney, Kleberg, La Salle, Maverick, Nueces, Presidio, Reeves, Starr, Terrell, Val Verde, Webb, Willacy, Zapata and Zavala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a></p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Will southern Texas negate suburban Democratic gains?" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JhOM9/12/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="676" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This is not to downplay Republicans’ gains along the border and in South Texas. Trump ultimately won 14 of these 28 counties — eight of which he flipped from 2016 — with many more counties than Starr lurching to the right: Maverick County moved 46 points to the right, Zapata County moved 38 points, Webb County moved 28 points and Hidalgo County moved 23 points. Hidalgo, with around 871,000 people, is the most populous county in the border area (edging out El Paso County’s 866,000), which made its shift toward Trump especially impactful in terms of raw vote totals. To be clear, President Biden still won the overall vote across the border and South Texas counties by 17 points, but this was about half the margin Hillary Clinton had in 2016, when she won the region by 33 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why Texas’s border region shifted so dramatically toward Republicans compared with the rest of the state has no one answer. According to Jason Villalba, the chairman and CEO of the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation and a former GOP representative in the state House, some national Democrats’ leftward shift on issues like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-climate-26908b855045d5ce7342fd01be8bcc10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clean energy and fossil fuels</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/23/defund-the-police-democrats-477609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policing</a> — including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/immigration/abolish-ice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calls to abolish or restructure</a> U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — likely turned off Hispanics along the Texas-Mexico border, who make up 85 percent of the population in those 28 counties and 23 percent of all Hispanics in the state. “Being labeled as against fossil fuels and supportive of defunding the police is not a winning message when the majority of the communities in the region are economically impacted by those two drivers,” Villalba said. “Then, layer on a cult of personality figure like Trump — and the Democrats are going to have a real problem, which they did.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Hispanic voters aren’t a monolith, and without Trump’s name on the ballot, it’s hard to tell whether Republican gains in South Texas will last. But so far, Biden isn’t polling particularly well with Hispanic voters in the state. A September poll from The Dallas Morning News/University of Texas-Tyler put Biden <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/526125317/The-Dallas-Morning-News-University-of-Texas-Tyler-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 points underwater with Hispanic voters in Texas</a>, while a separate <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University poll</a> the same month had him down 18 points among Hispanic registered voters in Texas. On top of that, Villalba said Democrats took the border region for granted in 2020, focusing much of their campaign on turning out Democrats in the state’s suburbs <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/04/joe-biden-texas-border-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather than Hispanic voters at the border</a> with Mexico. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">South Texas and the border area is also very rural, which may also have played an outsize role in why Republicans gained so much ground there. In 2020, the more rural the area, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-america-lost-and-gained-population-could-throw-democrats-a-redistricting-lifeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the better Trump tended to do</a>, and places with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large Hispanic populations were no exception</a>. This may explain in part why Trump performed so much better in more rural Starr and Maverick counties than in El Paso County, where Trump did only about 8 points better in 2020 than in 2016. This can’t explain all the differences, however, as Hidalgo and Webb counties are also more urban, yet Trump improved by more than 20 points in both. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another factor driving what we saw in 2020 could be educational attainment among Hispanics. Polarization by education has been a trend among white voters for years now, as Democrats have steadily picked up support among those with at least a four-year degree while losing support among those without one. But this trend may be affecting Latino voters, too, as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center found</a> Biden won 69 percent of Hispanics with a college degree nationally, but only 55 percent among those with some college or less. As a whole, the Texas border area isn’t as highly educated as the state’s metro areas, so this also may have played into the disparate shift to the right in many parts of the border region and South Texas. However, the share of Hispanics with a college degree in the border area is actually similar to that of the major metro areas as a whole, so this is far from clear-cut.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Democratic losses in the border areas may not frustrate their efforts to eventually turn Texas blue, primarily because the state’s four most populous metropolitan areas have trended Democratic over the past four years. These opposing trends potentially form a favorable tradeoff for Democrats because a lot more voters live in and around Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio and Austin than in the border regions. As the table below shows, those four big cities and their surroundings contributed nearly 70 percent of Texas’s 2020 presidential vote total, and all of them shifted left.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">These shifts allowed Biden to narrowly carry the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio metropolitan areas after Trump won them in 2016. It also boosted the Democrats’ edge in the Austin region. And what this did in terms of raw vote totals is telling: Compared with the 2016 election, Democrats added around 416,000 net votes — the total Biden gained over Clinton minus the total Trump gained — from these four metro areas. In contrast, Trump’s improvement in the 28 counties along the border and in South Texas produced only about 89,000 more net votes for the GOP. Although Trump was also helped by the rest of the state, which gave him about 151,000 additional net votes, the Democrats’ showing in those four big population centers outpaced what was happening outside them. This wasn’t enough to turn Texas blue — <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=48&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump still won the state</a> by about 631,000 votes — but it could point to a favorable trend for Democrats in the long run.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden didn’t make gains just in the core cities in these metropolitan areas, though. He also fared better in the suburban and exurban counties around them. In this way, Texas was a microcosm of what we saw across the nation in 2020, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-suburban-density-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats made gains in the inner and outer rings surrounding cities</a>, which proved critical to Biden’s victory. As the second-most-populous state in the country, Texas has many suburban and exurban areas, too, and there were many striking examples of red areas becoming bluer. With nearly 2 million people between them, Collin and Denton counties, north of Dallas-Fort Worth, shifted markedly to the left: Biden did about 12 points better than Clinton in each, converting places that Trump won in 2016 by 17 and 20 points, respectively, into only single-digit wins in 2020. With 609,000 inhabitants, Williamson County, which contains a small portion of northern Austin and a lot of suburban turf, even went from red to blue, going from about a 10-point Trump win in 2016 to a 1-point Biden win in 2020. Not every suburban or exurban county moved as much, but almost every county in the four big Texas metros got bluer in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In the suburban and exurban areas, there’s been a movement away from Trump and to the left. He’s really been a cancer for moderate-type voters, educated voters and voters who have typically been centrists,” Villalba said.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Democratic gains and changing demographic trends in the Texas suburbs have become such a force that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-congressional-map-could-give-a-huge-boost-to-gop-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans have opted to cede some of that turf</a> to Democrats to ensure overall GOP control. While Republicans are hoping to win over some of those South Texas seats in the U.S. House, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/senate_passed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their likely congressional map</a> intentionally draws Democratic Reps. Colin Allred of Dallas and Lizzie Pannill Fletcher of Houston into safely Democratic districts that had formerly been <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/07/congressional-districts-texas-Democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive suburban seats</a>. The GOP-controlled state legislature also <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/09/27/austin-gop-census-texas-congressional-district-redistricting-map-new/5886079001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">placed one of Texas’s new districts in Austin</a>, a Democratic stronghold, <a href="https://www.fairelectionsproject.org/gerrymandering-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pack in as many Democrats</a> as they could to help make surrounding seats redder. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With all that being said, Hispanic voters trending further to the right in the big metro areas could be an obstacle for Democrats. While Republicans made big gains in South Texas and along the border, heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in <a href="https://www.chron.com/houston/article/Five-maps-illustrating-Houston-s-racial-breakdown-12711221.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cities like Houston</a> also <a href="https://twitter.com/JMilesColeman/status/1325267759769546753" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inched toward the GOP</a>, although they still voted overwhelmingly Democratic. Should that trend continue, however, it would complicate Democrats’ ability to add more votes from the big metro areas. As such, it’s certainly in the GOP’s interest not only to make gains along the border <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/republicans-target-latino-voters-2022-community-centers-rcna2567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but also to make inroads in Hispanic communities</a> in more populous areas that still lean Democratic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After all, elections are won at the margins, and that’ll be true in Texas moving forward. Considering the magnitude of the Democratic gains in the major metropolitan areas, especially in the suburbs and exurbs, Republicans’ hold on Texas might be weakening. But depending on how electoral and demographic trends evolve, the GOP’s grip could tighten again — or slip entirely.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden’s standing with the public has deteriorated in the nine months since he has taken office. Now more Americans disapprove of his job performance than <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">approve of it</a>. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew talks about why that is, what the consequences are for Democrats and what they can do about it. They also check in on the upcoming Virginia governor’s race and discuss a FiveThirtyEight report about how Congress may have inadvertently legalized THC — the main psychoactive compound in marijuana.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Sen. Mitch McConnell didn’t know what he was doing when he passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 Farm Bill</a>. The bill included his provision that legalized industrial hemp, a form of cannabis that can be made into a wide variety of products including cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating cannabis compound commonly called CBD. That part was intentional — the law quickly launched a <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cannabidiol-cbd-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-billion dollar industry</a> that put the once-obscure CBD compound into lattes, seltzers and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cvs-sell-cbd-products-800-stores-8-states-n986016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of CVS stores</a> across the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after three years it appears one of the law’s biggest impacts was entirely unintentional: It accidentally created a booming market for synthetic THC, marijuana’s primary intoxicant. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The same type of CBD that’s for sale at CVS is now being synthetically converted into THC and packaged into vape cartridges and gummy bears. Thanks to a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill, these drugs are marketed as a “<a href="https://www.themountaineer.com/news/delta-8-a-legal-high/article_82426746-eee8-11eb-8ab1-97135a0bb33d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal high</a>” and sold online and in states where marijuana remains illegal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But chemists warn that <a href="https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/natural-products/Delta-8-THC-craze-concerns/99/i31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these drugs can contain hazardous solvents</a>, acids and unknown compounds. When FiveThirtyEight legally purchased hemp-derived THC products for testing, we found illegal levels of THC and a variety of mystery compounds that could not be identified. There are no federal safety testing requirements for these products, and while hemp companies occasionally publish test results, some brands have been caught <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10519251/what-is-delta-8-thc-gummies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using fake test documents</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21203766282209.jpg" alt="A selection of delta-8 THC products" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21203766282209.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21203766282209.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21203766282209.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>The 2018 Farm Bill opened the market for online retailers to sell hemp derivatives that can get you high. <p>Wilfredo Lee / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Sales data for the unregulated hemp market is difficult to track but Delta-8-THC, the most popular of these hemp-derived intoxicants, is considered by some <a href="https://www.greenmarketreport.com/delta-8-smokable-flower-is-saving-hemp-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry</a> <a href="https://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/ingredients/delta-8-thc-saving-sagging-cbd-biz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insiders</a> to be the fastest growing product in the hemp industry. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2016-01-01%202021-09-05&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Delta%208%20thc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google search data</a> indicates that interest in these hemp-derived drugs is heavily concentrated in the American South, where conventional pot remains illegal, although hemp-derived THC is also showing up in state-regulated marijuana markets. In Washington state, regulators <a href="https://lcb.wa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/rules/Statements/Conformed%20THC%20Isomers%20Policy%20Statement%2004282021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified in April</a> that it was illegal to convert CBD into Delta-9-THC after a company admitted it was converting CBD into Delta-9-THC and selling it in the recreational marijuana market. Sales at licensed dispensaries of products containing Delta-8-THC in their titles increased over 240 percent between the second quarters of 2020 and 2021, according to the data firm Headset.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s still deep disagreement over whether any of these hemp-derived THC products are actually legal, but McConnell’s loophole has allowed these drugs to proliferate widely across the country. The hemp industry has quickly moved past selling just Delta-8-THC and is now offering an increasingly long list of synthetic cannabinoids that they can ship directly to your door. Meanwhile, cannabis insiders are warning that the country could be on the verge of a bigger public health emergency than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/health/vaping-illness-tracker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019’s vape crisis, which</a> ultimately hospitalized thousands and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8007202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed at least 68 people</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet despite the unintended consequence of the 2018 Farm Bill, Congress is not in a rush to do much about it. McConnell and his Republican co-sponsors for the Farm Bill’s hemp provision declined to comment for this story. Two of the bill’s Democratic sponsors told FiveThirtyEight that they still stand by the Farm Bill’s language.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">America has entered a new era in its scattershot experiment with legal pot. In this latest chapter, McConnell has given the country synthetic pot that nobody is regulating and almost anyone can buy.</p>

Mitch McConnell pushed for hemp derivatives to become legal in order to help hemp farmers in Kentucky.

<p data-paragraph="main">Hemp might conjure images of coarse hoodies and beaded necklaces, but hemp plants can actually be made into dozens of things including <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/international/569849-rebuilding-haiti-with-bamboo-and-hemp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building materials</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/25/archives/worlds-oldest-fabric-is-now-its-newest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper</a>, <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/ingredients/article/hemp-seeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-protein food</a>, and even strong psychoactive drugs. (For his part, McConnell was very fond of <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/mitch-mcconnell-uses-hemp-pen-to-celebrate-one-year-anniversary-crops-legalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his pen made out of hemp</a>.) Hemp plants are often described as a “distant cousin” to marijuana. When McConnell was building support for hemp legalization he said it’s “an entirely separate plant” from marijuana. But this is incorrect. The line between these two types of cannabis is a legal distinction, not a scientific one. And in 2018, Congress defined hemp so broadly it included things that the layman would consider pot. </p>

Mitch McConnell and Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles were very excited about their pens made out of hemp in 2018. <p>Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The Farm Bill focused exclusively on Delta-9-THC (the type of THC common in marijuana), defining hemp as any cannabis plant with less than 0.3 percent Delta-9-THC. But Delta-9-THC is only one of over 100 active compounds found naturally in cannabis. Congress appeared to legalize all of these other compounds by including “all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers” in their definition of hemp.Many of these compounds are psychoactive and there are even different intoxicating versions of THC (called isomers), like Delta-8-THC or Delta-10-THC, which have the same chemical formula as Delta-9-THC but with the molecules slightly rearranged. Chemists can create even more types of cannabinoids synthetically in a lab.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Congress apparently didn’t realize that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As of December 2018, I had never heard of Delta-8[-THC] or Delta-10[-THC] and I can probably assure you that McConnell and others hadn’t either,” said Jonathan Miller, a former Kentucky state treasurer and a lawyer who worked closely with McConnell’s office to write the 2018 bill. Miller said the law was intentionally written so that CBD and other non-intoxicating cannabis compounds could be legally sourced from hemp. But the authors didn’t realize “how this broader language could sweep intoxicating compounds into that [Delta-9-THC] limit.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McConnell has spent years fighting for hemp legalization and, in particular, the legalization of CBD in an effort to appease his home state’s farmers. He made hemp legalization <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/us/13hemp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a campaign issue in 2013</a> and, when the Drug Enforcement Agency <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/is-dea-dazed-confused-over-industrial-hemp-90536/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked Kentucky’s farmers from growing CBD-rich</a> hemp under an earlier pilot program, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/mitch-mcconnell-hemp-115671/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">senator publicly fought the agency</a> until the DEA backed down. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When it came to writing the 2018 law, McConnell apparently didn’t want to take any chances with the DEA. His provision permanently removed hemp from the Controlled Substance Act and his broad definition of hemp extracts appears to have pulled its language from <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/14/2016-29941/establishment-of-a-new-drug-code-for-marihuana-extract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 DEA guidance</a> that the agency had used to shut down earlier attempts at selling CBD. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://goodtimes.sc/special-publications-inserts/hemp-rules-market-glut-industry-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An oversupply of CBD</a> is further accelerating the development of these drugs by providing a cheap starting material to hemp companies, which can turn CBD into a wide variety of intoxicating compounds like Delta-8-THC or Delta-10-THC. Hemp companies are effectively solving America’s CBD oversupply problem by turning CBD into THC vape pens and gummy bears.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The country’s biggest hemp companies have largely stayed out of the Delta-8-THC craze and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-02/a-pot-knockoff-sometimes-made-with-household-acid-draws-scrutiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are increasingly worried</a> about the hemp-derived intoxicant market. Cannabis advocates have spent years claiming <a href="https://norml.org/blog/2013/01/20/industrial-hemp-reform-emerging-from-marijuana-legalization-election-victories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp is not psychoactive</a>, <a href="https://drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Marijuana_Facts_Booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabis is safe</a> and <a href="https://www.mpp.org/issues/legalization/regulating-marijuana-protecting-youth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal reform will keep pot out of the hands of kids</a>. Miller said the Delta-8-THC craze has left members of Congress questioning their support for further pot reform.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This whole Delta-8 thing has unnerved all of us because we continue to make the case that hemp is not marijuana. They hear about Delta-8 and some wavering members of congress say wait a minute,” Miller said. “I used to call myself ‘Jonathan Hemp-is-not-marijuana Miller’ because that was all I talked about. The Delta-8 issue clouds that message.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Congress could shut down many of these products by passing a new law that narrows the definition of hemp, but those who pushed for the original legislation do not appear to be interested in ending the inadvertent legalization of THC — and some appear to be very comfortable with the situation it created.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP18332810007395.jpg" alt="Mitch McConnell inspects a piece of hemp at a processing plant." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP18332810007395.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP18332810007395.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP18332810007395.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Yes, you can bale hemp. <p>Bruce Schreiner / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">McConnell led a bipartisan effort to legalize hemp with support from Sens. Rand Paul, Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, Rep. James Comer, and former Rep. Jared Polis. (Paul and Comer are Republicans; Merkley, Wyden and Polis are Democrats.) None of the sponsors agreed to an interview for this story or answered written questions. A spokesperson for Polis, who was elected governor of Colorado in 2018, said that: “The Farm Bill amendments were written broadly to make hemp accessible and support scientific research. The language has supported the growth of Colorado’s well-regulated cannabis industry.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nicole L’Esperance, a spokesperson for Wyden, blamed the unregulated THC market on cannabis prohibition and said Wyden’s solution is to legalize all forms of cannabis and force the Food And Drug Agency to regulate the industry.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Any legal gray area is the result of decades of the failed system of cannabis prohibition, leaving states, farmers, businesses, consumers to navigate a patchwork of laws,” L’Esperance said in an email. “These products are on the market now and should be regulated by the FDA to protect the public health like other products, and Wyden has been pushing for the FDA to act now.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But the FDA isn’t acting. The FDA is actively <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/fda-objects-to-cbd-dietary-supplement-as-regulatory-haze-lingers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refusing to regulate</a> the CBD market and has so far only issued <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an online warning</a> that said the agency was “aware of the growing concerns surrounding Delta-8 THC products currently being sold online and in stores.” The FDA declined to comment for this story and instead directed FiveThirtyEight to the DEA. The DEA declined to comment as well, citing an ongoing rulemaking process for hemp products. The agency already clarified in <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2020/fr0821.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August of 2020</a> that they consider hemp-derived THC to be illegal, but the agency has yet to take any noticeable action against companies selling these products, according to Chelsie Spencer, a Dallas-based attorney who specializes in hemp law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The lack of enforcement is a bit unfathomable because we’ve seen the DEA make statements on Delta-8[-THC] being illegal,” Spencer said. It’s possible that the DEA is afraid a judge will rule against the agency if the agency tries to shut down a Delta-8-THC producer, according to Spencer. “Either it’s a fear of an adverse [legal] decision or that they have bigger fish to fry with the opioid crisis going on.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">State governments have scrambled to regulate these unregulated intoxicants <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/delta-8-thc-legal-many-states-some-want-ban-it-n1272270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with 14 states prohibiting Delta-8-THC</a> — which theoretically also forbids online sales in those states — and many more states considering bans or regulations for hemp-derived intoxicants.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Greg Gerdeman, a hemp entrepreneur and neuroscientist responsible for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major breakthroughs</a> in understanding cannabinoids, said it feels like some hemp companies are just trying to cash in on this legal gray area before it closes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I see some folks in the hemp industry and it feels like they’re saying, ‘Haha Congress! We gotcha. You said something you didn’t understand or mean but by goodness we are going to claim that it is our right to make this,’” Gerdeman said.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Purchasing Delta-8-THC was the easiest drug deal I have ever made — far easier than buying legal marijuana. A quick Google search found the website “Bearly Legal Hemp Co,” which advertises itself with a bear smoking a cigarette surrounded by the motto “Can’t believe its [sic] not weed.” I browsed through an online catalog of Delta-8-THC products and bought a bag of gummy bears, a pack of pre-rolled Delta-8 joints, and a vape cartridge of Delta-8-THC-O acetate, a new cannabinoid that the website promised could be “considered Delta-8 on steroids.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">THC-O, as it is more commonly called, represents a new class of molecules for the hemp industry. When hemp companies make Delta-8 THC, they are using lab synthesis to replicate a compound naturally produced by cannabis (although only found in extremely small quantities). But Delta-8-THC-O acetate is a lab-designed molecule that is never found in nature. Very little is known about THC-O’s effects but its production process is similar to how morphine is “acetylated” into heroin. In both heroin and THC-O, a chemist synthetically modifies the drug so it can deliver a stronger high. Bearly Legal warned customers to “Tread Lightly!” with this new cannabinoid because it’s “highly potent.”</p>

A week later the U.S. Postal Service delivered the hemp intoxicants to my door with no identification check required.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I sent the three products to KCA Labs, a Kentucky laboratory that is considered a national leader in testing hemp-derived products. Their test results showed that the Delta-8 I bought could get someone high, but it would come laced with compounds so mysterious a lab couldn’t identify them.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KCA Labs ran two tests on each product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The gummies had less than 0.3 percent Delta-9-THC (the federal limit for hemp), but the hemp pre-rolled joints contained 1.14 percent Delta-9-THC and the THC-O acetate cartridge contained 0.62 percent Delta-9-THC, both over the federal legal limit. The THC-O acetate also contained heptane, a toxic industrial solvent, and lead, but both were detected at low levels and below the legal limit for marijuana products in California’s regulated market, which is <a href="https://www.thompsoncoburn.com/insights/blogs/tracking-cannabis/post/2018-10-04/a-state-by-state-ranking-of-cannabis-regulations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered an authority</a> on marijuana safety standards.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bearly Legal did not respond to multiple requests for comment from FiveThirtyEight.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All three of the products also contained compounds that could not be identified by KCA Labs. Richard Sams, KCA’s scientific director who has a Ph.D. in pharmaceutical sciences, said these unknown compounds are likely synthetic cannabinoids that are created as byproducts during the CBD conversion process. “These side products are being produced in all of these reactions,” Sams said. No matter how reputable the company you’re buying your Delta-8 from, there’s likely to be some unknown compounds that come along with it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kyle Boyar, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, said the chemistry behind converting CBD to THC is very well understood but executing these reactions safely requires expertise in synthetic chemistry, something many hemp companies lack.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s well established how it works but the problem is that a lot of people who are doing this are not trained on synthesis, they are just getting information off the internet and trying it to see if it works. It’s a bit worrisome and a little bit scary,” Boyar said. “It really does seem like a cash grab for a lot of people right now because of the lack of oversight.”</p>

These types of synthetic cannabinoids were <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MuqLHOJxu5oY10cAuWclcXYdMWkHt--S/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first invented by the pharmaceutical industry</a> and can react with our internal cannabinoid receptors in unnaturally strong ways. Synthetic cannabinoids are already a common street drug, sold under names like Spice or K2, that send <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7874647/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of people to the hospital</a> every year and have killed <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26567470/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 26 people</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gerdeman, the cannabis scientist and hemp entrepreneur, said Delta-8-THC by itself is likely a very safe compound but he said it’s possible that hemp chemists “monkeying around in an unregulated laboratory” could accidentally create a dangerous synthetic cannabinoid without realizing it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A mountain of rigorous mainstream pre-clinical scientific research has taught us that Delta-9-THC is in general a very safe molecule,” Gerdeman said. “But then the Spice/K2 experience … taught us that just because a drug acts at a cannabinoid receptor doesn’t mean it’s safe.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Synthetic cannabinoids have already shown up in the hemp market. In 2019, researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379073818307047?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that four out of nine vape cartridges purchased from <a href="http://www.diamondcbd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.DiamondCBD.com</a> contained 5F-ADB, a dangerous synthetic molecule that mimics cannabinoids and is already an illegal substance at the federal level. The company’s CEO told <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cbd/dangerous-chemicals-found-in-popular-cbd-products-diamond-cbd-5f-adb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a> that DiamondCBD was going to retest all of its products after the study was published and recall any found to contain such compounds. An <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ut-state-wire-tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-cbd-marijuana-7b452f4af90b4620ab0ff0eb2cca62cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP News investigation</a> in 2019 found even more brands selling CBD vape cartridges with synthetic cannabinoids.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The industry’s new THC-O products could also lead to the same type of lung damage identified during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/health/vaping-marijuana-ecigarettes-sickness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019-20 vape crisis</a>, according to Brad Douglass, a vice president of regulatory affairs for The Werc Shop, a multi-state cannabis processor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that a vape additive called vitamin E acetate was “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#what-we-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly linked</a>” to the lung damage and Douglass said THC-O could create the same type of lung damage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The belief is that the problem with vitamin E acetate in vape products is that at certain temperatures vitamin E degrades into ketenes, which are akin to a chemical warfare agent with toxic and corrosive gas,” Douglass said. “The same sort of breakdown can occur with THC-O acetate at very high temperatures.”</p>



<hr><h2>The FDA can fix it. Will it?</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2018 Farm Bill explicitly gave the FDA authority over hemp regulations, but so far the agency has refused to even regulate dietary CBD products, let alone drugs like Delta-8-THC or Delta-8-THC-O acetate that are produced from converted CBD, claiming that federal law prevents them from doing so. That has created the current situation, where new forms of THC are being sold around the country with no assurance that these new synthetic drugs are free of dangerous solvents or byproducts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Douglass said that’s a shame, because the FDA clearly has the scientific experts and regulatory ability to regulate hemp derivatives. The FDA has a long history of regulating synthetic drugs — for example, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/03/13/289750754/wake-up-and-smell-the-caffeine-its-a-powerful-drug" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of caffeine</a> found in energy drinks and sodas is produced synthetically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If the FDA were serious about the mandate to regulate hemp products then they could clear up a lot of this chemistry pretty easily,” Douglass said. That’s what the scientists at the FDA are supposed to be good at — examining complicated science and determining what is dangerous and what is not. “There’s been other times that the FDA has dealt with the risks and complexities involved with synthesis.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sens. Wyden, Paul and Merkley introduced legislation in May that would <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Hemp%20Access%20and%20Consumer%20Safety%20Act%20of%202021%20Bill%20Text.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">force the FDA</a> to regulate CBD and hemp-derivative products like Delta-8. But the law is focused on regulating, not ending, the Delta-8 market — it would not change the broad definition of hemp that was included in the 2018 bill. </p>

That surplus has also created a market for synthetic THC. <p>Derek Davis / Portland Portland Press Herald via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Other countries have mostly avoided the pitfalls of America’s commercialize first, regulate second approach to industrial hemp. Europe’s hemp legalization <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32013R1307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlawed all THC</a> over <a href="https://hemptoday.net/european-parliament-signs-off-on-raising-eu-thc-limit-to-0-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0.3 percent</a>, not just Delta-9-THC, and didn’t include McConnell’s derivatives and extracts language, which appears to have limited the hemp intoxicant industry. And when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/07/cbd-will-go-on-sale-in-australia-but-first-manufacturers-will-have-to-prove-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australia legalized CBD earlier this year</a>, the country required that all CBD products must first be approved by its version of the FDA before they can be sold, although the agency has yet to approve any CBD products.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unsurprisingly, individual states are taking the lead in regulating hemp while the FDA looks the other way. Oregon’s state legislature <a href="https://harrisbricken.com/cannalawblog/oregons-new-thc-in-milligrams-limit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently passed a law</a> that is gaining support among hemp advocates as a model way to regulate cannabinoids. The law creates a new class of “adult-use cannabis” products for anything that contains THC, its isomers, or “any artificially derived cannabinoid that is reasonably determined to have an intoxicating effect.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the current patchwork of state laws has allowed hemp companies to make money selling unregulated and intoxicating drugs like the one FiveThirtyEight purchased. Hemp processors continue to have access to cheap materials to make hemp intoxicants with the price of CBD isolate remaining at around $500 a kilo in August of this year, down from over $4,400 in August 2019, according to Hemp Benchmarks. New cannabinoids continue to proliferate in the market.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In August, Bearly Legal Hemp Co., the website FiveThirtyEight procured Delta-8-THC from, released a cannabinoid they call HHC. The website compares HHC directly to THC and says it is “legal in states that have banned Delta-8.” The website goes on to say that “Some people claim it gives them the same euphoric feeling, pain-fighting, and anti nausea/vomiting effects that THC does. Some just enjoy the Buzz :).”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That emoticon is what passes for quality control in the unregulated Delta-8-THC market. The incredible complexity of regulating the cannabis plant is being determined by lawyers and politicians, not the scientists who actually know what is behind these products. That means easier highs for many Americans, but also a designer drug market full of mysterious compounds and clear potential health risks to consumers. Is that what D.C. wants?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Oct. 18, 2021, 3:58 p.m.): </strong>An earlier version of this article misquoted Brad Douglass. When speaking about the problem with vitamin E acetate in vape products, he warned about the substance degrading into ketenes, not ketones. Those ketenes are akin to chemical warfare agents, but are not actually chemical warfare agents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (Oct. 20, 7:11 p.m.):</strong> An earlier version of this article included a chart with inaccurate depictions of the chemical structure for CBD, Delta-8-THC and Delta-9-THC. It also suggested that Delta-8-THC has “nearly” the same molecular formula as Delta-9-THC, when it actually has the same formula but a different structure.</p>]]></description>
