<p data-paragraph="main">Presidential hopefuls are already fundraising, traveling the country and crafting their messages for the 2024 contest. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew hosts its first-ever 2024 Republican primary draft (they plan to follow up next week with a 2024 Democratic primary draft). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The crew also considers whether airline passengers’ apparent eagerness to quit masking is evidence that polls showing a majority of Americans support airplane mask mandates are actually inaccurate.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">By September 2021, the scientists and staffers at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wvR0kA6hcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had gathered enough data</a> to know that the trees in its green-tree reservoirs — a type of hardwood wetland ecosystem — were dying. At Hurricane Lake, <a href="https://www.agfc.com/en/zone-map/709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wildlife management area of 17,000 acres</a>, the level of severe illness and death in the timber population was up to 42 percent, especially for certain species of oak, according to a 2014 forest-health assessment. The future of another green-tree reservoir, Bayou Meto, <a href="https://www.agfc.com/en/zone-map/702/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 33,000 acres</a>, would look the same if they didn’t act quickly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were a lot of reasons the trees were dying, but it was also partly the commission’s fault. Long ago, the Mississippi and Arkansas rivers and their tributaries would have flooded the bayous naturally, filling bottomland forests during the winter months when the trees were dormant and allowing new saplings to grow after the waters receded in the spring. Widespread European settlement and agriculture largely halted the natural flooding, but in the 1950s, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission <a href="https://www.agfc.com/en/hunting/migratory-birds/waterfowl/gtr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began buying bottomland forests for preservation</a>, which it then flooded with a system of levees and other tools.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This made the forests an ideal winter stop for ducks to eat and rest on their annual migration south. Arkansas is a magnet for duck hunters, and the state has issued more than 100,000 permits for duck hunters from Arkansas and out of state for every year since 2014. But it turned out the commission was flooding the reservoirs too early and at levels too high, which was damaging the trees. The ducks that arrive in Arkansas especially love eating the acorns from a certain species of oak — and those oaks are now dying.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Austin Booth, director of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, knew that convincing the state’s duck hunters and businesses that there was a serious problem would be tricky. Part of the solution the commission planned to propose to save the trees involved delaying the annual fall flooding, which could mean less habitat for the ducks, fewer ducks stopping in the area and more duck hunters crowded into smaller spaces fighting over targets.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And all the duck hunters would have their own ideas about who to blame for the problem and what the solution should be.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-804005388-711.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-804005388-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-804005388-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-804005388-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Ducks in a wildlife refuge in northeastern Arkansas. <p>GETTY IMAGES</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Last September, Booth gave a brief speech that was streamed live on YouTube, outlining the problem. He announced a series of public meetings to begin in the following months. Booth told me that when he began to plan those meetings, he thought of all the government meetings and town halls he’d attended after years working in politics. “I wanted to ratchet down some of the intensity that happens when a government official stands up on a stage and talks down to people,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, he decided the meetings would be dinners where the Game and Fish staff would eat alongside the people they sought to convince. “I just believe there’s a human component to sitting down and having a meal with someone,” he said. At those dinners, he’d give a brief introduction, then invite people to ask questions of the staff as they ate and mingled. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the end of the dinners, Booth said he’d stand up again and ask, “Is there anyone that’s going to walk through that door tonight without their questions answered or comments taken for the record, or with their concerns ignored?” No one, he said, came forward. The four dinners were attended by between 50 and 100 people, according to Booth, but those attendees then spread the word, dampening criticism of the new management system.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s interesting about this dinner program is that it began during the COVID-19 pandemic, which also required effective science communication to convince the public to accept changes, major and minor, to their lives. Even before this pandemic, there’s been a long history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/mask-protests-1918.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resistance to public health measures</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22958419/covid-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new vaccines</a>, and many researchers suspected that could likely be the case with COVID-19 as well. The social scientists who study these issues might have counseled an approach like that employed by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, using local messengers who had relationships with the communities in question and who could communicate in less intimidating ways.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the U.S. did not do that with COVID-19. Instead, rapidly changing information came from only a few sources, usually at the national level and seemingly without much strategy. And as such, many places have seen widespread resistance to public health interventions, like wearing masks and getting the vaccine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The intensely local, personal way that Arkansas Game and Fish approached this challenge is difficult, time-consuming and perhaps not always the most practical. But it shows the kind of intensity it takes to communicate an urgent problem, and may provide lessons for how to approach the next big problems — whether that’s another pandemic, an ecological disaster or something bigger and more existential, like climate change.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Before the pandemic, Matthew Motta, a political science professor at Oklahoma State University, and his colleagues Timothy Callaghan, Steven Sylvester, Kristin Lunz Trujillo and Christine Crudo Blackburn <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953619303934" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studied parents’ hesitancy</a> about giving their kids routine vaccinations, like those for measles, mumps and rubella. Reasons varied, and the most prominent was conspiratorial thinking.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured this by having respondents rate on a seven-point scale their agreement with a handful of statements like “much of our lives are being controlled by plots hatched in secret places.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> Some parents who delayed their children’s vaccines also held strong ideas about moral/bodily purity, which often correlated with higher levels of religiosity. Evangelical Christians, people who distrusted scientists and other experts and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/19/conspiracy-theories-are-common-right-but-few-republicans-adhere-all-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people prone to believing in conspiracies</a> were also among the groups finding a home in the Republican Party, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of these characteristics also tend to cluster in rural areas, where <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-vaccine-attitudes-rural-suburban-urban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 vaccination rates continue to lag</a>. “With the very important caveat that we’re talking about two different vaccines … I would say it’s roughly the same groups of people,” Motta said. “My colleagues and I … tried to shout this from the rooftops. … We saw this coming for sure.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1366" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218063-1024.jpg" alt="Anti-vaccination demonstrators" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218063-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218063-1024.jpg?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218063-1024.jpg?w=2048 2x"><figcaption>In July 2021, as coronavirus cases rose in Arkansas, demonstrators gathered outside a community town hall at Arkansas State University-Mountain Home to protest vaccine mandates. <p>Liz Sanders / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In subsequent research conducted before the pandemic, Motta and his colleagues found <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912920907695" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible paths to countering vaccine hesitancy</a>. “One way we can try to get skeptics on board with vaccinating is to just make an effort to understand why they’re skeptical, and portray the benefits of vaccinating in those terms,” Motta said. For example, Americans who felt that vaccines tainted their moral/bodily purity were given information about how viruses also attacked and invaded the body, which raised their opinions of vaccines. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The COVID-19 vaccines, however, were rolled out without much of that targeted messaging. Worsening the matter, then-President Donald Trump and his administration made <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/14/trump-advisers-pandemic-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of missteps</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted misinformation</a>, which only further hampered the country’s ability to form a coherent plan. On top of that, the virus was <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/beast-moving-very-fast-will-new-coronavirus-be-contained-or-go-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast moving</a> from the beginning of the pandemic, and the United States is a big country with multiple public health agencies, each with a different level of authority. The authority that state and local health departments have varies by state, which meant communication strategies were varied as well. Meanwhile, in much of rural America, hospitals <a href="https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had already gone through waves of closures</a>, in addition to decades of <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305728" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underinvestment</a> in rural public health.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some nonprofit groups <a href="https://www.ruralhealth.us/programs/covid-19-pandemic/covid-19-vaccine-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled to correct these rural disparities</a>, but unfortunately, the underlying issues were too deep-rooted for them to fully counteract. Rural Americans were <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jrh.12556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far less likely to take precautions against COVID-19</a>, like wearing a mask, avoiding restaurants or working from home. Last September, during the delta wave, the death rate in rural areas <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-killing-rural-americans-twice-rate-people-urban-areas-n1280369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was double that of urban areas</a>. As of Jan. 10, 2022, only 48 percent of rural Americans were vaccinated, compared with 61 percent of their urban counterparts, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/covid-19/rural-america/covid-19-vaccinations-in-rural-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1366" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218538-1024.jpg" alt="Arkansas residents attend a community town hall to promote Covid-19 vaccinations" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218538-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218538-1024.jpg?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218538-1024.jpg?w=2048 2x"><figcaption>Despite local events promoting the safeness and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, rural areas overall still lag in getting vaccinated. <p>Liz Sanders / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These patterns are partly explained by preexisting issues. People in rural areas hold old, well-known anxieties about scientists, particularly when the scientists come from the government. <a href="https://www.covidstates.org/people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristin Lunz Trujillo</a>, a postdoctoral researcher with the COVID States Project, said this anxiety stemmed from an attitude that pits rural, hands-on knowledge against the kind of knowledge obtained from institutions like universities or government bureaucracies — a kind of anti-establishment view that extends to scientists. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lunz Trujillo told me an example of this phenomenon is land-grant institutions using their rural extension services to bring the latest agricultural research to recalcitrant farmers who don’t want to be told how to farm. This was illustrated in the 1983 TV movie “The Day After,” in which a Missouri farmer played by John Cullum points out the impracticality of a government agent’s plan to scrape up all of the topsoil following a nuclear explosion — acres of soil that would have nowhere to go. “Where did you get this information, John, all this good advice? Out of some government pamphlet?” Cullum’s character yells at the agent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And now this attitude has become more entwined with partisanship and partisan politics. In a 2021 paper published in American Political Science Review, political scientists David C. Barker, Ryan Detamble and Morgan Marietta looked at <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/intellectualism-antiintellectualism-and-epistemic-hubris-in-red-and-blue-america/37C9F95A5DF4F81BAF69677DC6C9C972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans’ growing distrust of scientists and other experts</a>. Their research shows that partly due to the education divide — i.e., college graduates prefer the Democratic Party, and white people without a college degree prefer the Republican Party — the divide between those who are pro-intellectualism and those who are anti-intellectualism is more entrenched in party politics.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Trust in science has become increasingly partisan" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Jq9Ca/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Importantly, Barker and his colleagues defined anti-intellectualism not as a respondent's ability or personal level of education. Instead, it was about respondents having positive feelings about trusting one’s gut and having negative feelings toward experts, schools and “the book-smarts of intellectuals.” In their paper, the researchers wrote that those who distrust scientists and other official sources of authority “distinguish those who are ‘book smart’ from those who have common sense, the latter of which they view as a superior means of ascertaining truth.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They found that people with this attitude were more likely to align with the Republican Party. Which makes sense. Trump has <a href="http://vox.com/2015/9/16/9342825/donald-trump-vaccines-autism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted the vaccine-autism myth</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/world/asia/china-trump-climate-change.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falsely claimed that climate change is a hoax</a>. Trump’s anti-intellectualism surely <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X17719507" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracted voters</a> who already shared these beliefs, but he also might have influenced other people to take up such beliefs. According to one study, he was the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary spreader of COVID-19 misinformation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These partisan trends existed before Trump’s presidency, of course, but Barker and his colleagues wrote that they spiked during his tenure. And instead of receding once Trump left the national stage, the partisan realignment seems to be firmer than ever.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1366" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1238908397-1024.jpg" alt="Anti-vaccination mandate demonstrators at the Peoples Convoy caravan" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1238908397-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1238908397-1024.jpg?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1238908397-1024.jpg?w=2048 2x"><figcaption>Trump’s skepticism toward COVID-19 precautions likely both attracted voters already holding such beliefs and inspired others to adopt them. <p>Cheney Orr / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This past February, Lunz Trujillo published work that shows this kind of anti-science attitude <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-022-09770-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is associated with having a rural identity</a>. And this identity is held not only by people who live in rural areas, but also by people who strongly <em>identify</em> as rural, regardless of where they currently live.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s more how people think of themselves versus where they are,” Lunz Trujillo said. She cited the political scientist Katherine J. Cramer’s well-known work on <a href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/katherine-j-cramer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rural resentment</a>, which illustrated that many rural people disdained anything perceived to be urban — racial and ethnic minorities, liberals, the LGBTQ community, cultural elites — and tied it to their rejection of intellectuals and intellectualism as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The key insight to all this work is that those who distrust vaccines, science and expertise aren’t doing so necessarily because they have a knowledge gap or a misunderstanding. Distrusting experts is part of their identity. Motta and his colleagues’ work <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21565503.2021.1932528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests that being anti-vaccine has become an identity</a>, too. In some respects, distrusting experts has become a political choice, which means that any message from an official source — whether it’s a researcher, head of a government agency or a journalist — is more likely to inspire the opposite of its intended reaction from those who view that source as part of the political opposition.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These trends might be spreading to include some experts themselves. Motta <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X22003024?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a paper earlier this month</a> that shows about 10 percent of primary care physicians were uncertain about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, despite abundant evidence that they have been extremely safe and effective. The vaccine-hesitant doctors shared many of the same characteristics as other vaccine skeptics: They were more likely to be rural and conservative. For rural areas especially, this data suggests a vicious feedback loop. People who were suspicious of the vaccines had doctors who were suspicious, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/intellectualism-antiintellectualism-and-epistemic-hubris-in-red-and-blue-america/37C9F95A5DF4F81BAF69677DC6C9C972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barker and his colleagues wrote</a>, the danger of anti-intellectualism becoming more entwined with partisanship is that these attitudes then become more entrenched and harder to overcome. And that will become true on both sides, as each group believes they have the best sources of information — a phenomenon he called epistemic hubris. It’s damaging public debate.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The problems we’ve seen with COVID-19 are also spreading to new groups of people and to other issues. Dana Fisher, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, researches the social science of climate change, and she’s found that people are more likely to seek out sources that confirm what they already believe. “We see that scientific information is very, very clearly cherry-picked,” she said. Increasingly, she sees people looking for information that already supports their worldview, and that’s happening on the right and left. For her, this includes policymakers who have a role to play in solving issues like climate change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The challenge is how to penetrate these bubbles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Luke Naylor is the waterfowl program coordinator at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. I recently went with him to visit Bayou Meta, which locals pronounce as “bio-mee-da.” There’s no real way to measure this, but the nearby city of Stuttgart calls itself the duck-hunting capital of the world. On the way to the bayou, down a mostly empty two-lane highway, we stopped at a gas station decorated in woodland camouflage. Naylor told me the owner of the gas station opens before dawn during duck-hunting season to serve that clientele.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this month, Luke and his colleague Jason Jackson took me through part of the bayou to show me the dead trees. Certain species of oak were under unique stress because they sat in water for too long during the year, and the bases of some trees were swollen. As we stood on a levee, Naylor and Jackson pointed out a tree they’d watched die over the previous summer as well as other trees showing signs of distress. Elsewhere, we saw trees downed in clusters. Even someone without an idea of what to look for would have been stunned.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tree experts had started to notice these issues in the 1980s and 1990s, Naylor told me. I asked him if hunters had raised their own concerns, and he said they noticed more now that the issues had been pointed out to them. “We put a name on some stuff back when we started talking about it openly,” Naylor said. “People look at it like, ‘Huh, that tree is bigger right there,’ or ‘They’re all leaning.’” Some isolated dead trees are blamed on ice storms or other rough weather, he said, but the sheer number of dead trees becomes more obvious once you know how to recognize the signs. “You’re running your boat through here or try to walk through it duck-hunting, you notice real quick.”</p>

The water had to flow through levees built decades ago by the federal government, when building the levees was treated as an engineering problem, not an ecological one. The channels also had various right angles, which slowed the water’s course, making it hard to clear the reservoir as needed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This was the next problem they wanted to tackle: redesigning the old levees. They said that some hunters unhappy about the changes to the intentional flooding in the fall thought that spring rains were the real problem. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We never said it wasn’t,” Naylor said. Spring rains definitely sit in the reservoirs for too long and for too late in the year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The issue was that the levees are old and expensive, and changing them to deal with the spring rains would be a multimillion-dollar and multiyear project. Naylor and Booth, the head of Game and Fish, both repeated the same message: that the fall flooding was something they were already doing incorrectly, and was a problem they could control and a solution they could easily enact. That’s why they chose that route first. Taking ownership of the problem was the key to the program’s success, they said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I asked Naylor and Booth each if any of the hunters they’d spoken to asked about an obvious potential culprit: climate change. Naylor said that no one had. And while it’s true that the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission had been intentionally flooding the green-tree reservoirs too early and too much, climate change is expected to bring <a href="https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-ar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more severe flooding</a> to Arkansas, and heavy spring downpours are likely to increase in the years ahead. The region is already seeing wetter springs and higher rivers because the northern plains — where the headwaters for the Mississippi River are — are wetter, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That potentially controversial aspect was mostly avoided in their conversations with the hunters, which may show the limits of this approach. Whatever methods any group or agency takes to deal with a local ecological problem will be only a small piece of the puzzle if climate change exacerbates the core of those problems. Partisanship <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already affects views</a> on climate change and how to solve it — or whether it needs solving at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What struck me most about my time with Naylor and Jackson is that they were both also hunters and, despite being experts in their field, already had a level of trust with the hunters they were trying to convince. They spoke with mid-Southern accents, drove trucks and wore camo. They’re well-educated experts, but it’s hard to imagine that local and out-of-state duck hunters would see them as eggheads that could be easily dismissed. When Booth described his staff’s expertise to me, he said they had “dirt under their fingernails,” which was similar to how Lunz Trujillo explained the kind of experiential knowledge valued by farmers and other rural folks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But not every issue manifests locally, with local experts able to gather people for friendly dinners. Regarding climate change, Fisher says in her work now she is finding that people are often spurred to action only when the environmental damage becomes an extreme personal risk to them and their family, and when it is seen as preventable. Part of the problem with mitigating COVID-19, she said, was that many people didn’t see the virus as a personal risk — they thought they themselves would be OK, even if so many other people were dying.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Public pushback on the changes that the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has made to green-tree reservoirs has so far been minimal, according to Booth, but the commission also has a captive audience. Duck hunters, other hunters and fishermen rely on information from the commission every year to apply for licenses and announce when public lands are open for hunting. These hunters visit government-run websites regularly to check water levels and other information to plan their hunting trips. Plus, the green-tree reservoirs are entirely owned and managed by the commission, which means how to manage the lands is its decision.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I asked James Brandenburg, an Arkansas volunteer with Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers, a conservation organization that tries to engage hunters and fishers, whether this kind of approach was scalable. Could we do something like what Arkansas Game and Fish did with larger-scale problems? He described how one of the biggest benefits he’d seen at the dinners was that hunters and other affected groups could ask questions and voice their concerns — and that they were heard, whether or not what they said made a difference in the decisions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don't know that it needs to be scalable, it just needs to be repeated,” he said. “We have to have the people who are willing to listen. You have to have the decision-makers who are invested enough in the process of gathering that information to make it a priority to have the conversations.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Increasingly, though, the question is how to have those conservations in the first place. It’s hard to share information if people reject it because it comes from experts and is reported through the mainstream press. That will determine, as much as anything, how we respond to serious challenges moving forward.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">There are still <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/11/5-crucial-decisions-jan-6-panel-00024104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of questions</a> surrounding the final phase of the House committee established to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Namely, we don’t know exactly when it will be, though the committee reportedly wants to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/house-jan-committee-faces-time-crunch-ahead-public/story?id=83765172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start public hearings in May</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It might be in the committee’s best interest to stick to that timeline, as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/gop-jan-6-committee-00005943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fate of the committee is uncertain</a> if the GOP takes over control of the House next year. Moreover, many Americans want to move on from investigating the events of Jan. 6. A recent Navigator Research poll found, for instance, that <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Navigator-Toplines-04.05.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">39 percent</a> of registered voters thought the House committee investigating the attack was too focused on the past, compared to 49 percent who said the committee was doing important work. And a January poll from the Pew Research Center found that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/08/fewer-americans-now-say-trump-bears-a-lot-of-responsibility-for-the-jan-6-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans were pretty divided over whether too much attention</a> was being devoted to the insurrection: Thirty-five percent said “too much” attention had been paid to the attacks, while 33 percent said the “right amount” and 31 percent said “too little.” That said, in another January poll (this one from Quinnipiac), <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">44 percent of Americans thought it was time to move on</a>, while 50 percent thought that the attack should never be forgotten.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The investigation has been going on for a while now, so it’s hard to know how engaged Americans have been. But the majority of Americans are paying attention to some recent developments. The Navigator poll found that <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Navigator-Toplines-04.05.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53 percent of respondents</a> had heard “a lot” or “some” about a federal judge ruling that former President Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-finds-trump-committed-felony-obstruction-effort-overturn/story?id=83721530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely than not broke the law</a> in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, in line with what <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/04/05131819/2204008_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> found (52 percent of registered voters said they had seen, read or heard “a lot” or “some” about the ruling). And per a recent poll from Quinnipiac, 59 percent of Americans said <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they had been following the committee’s actions</a> “very” or “somewhat” closely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, some polls suggest that Americans have been holding Trump less responsible for the attack. The most recent polling we have on this question is from January, but at the time, Pew found that the share of respondents who said Trump bore no responsibility at all for the attack had <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/08/fewer-americans-now-say-trump-bears-a-lot-of-responsibility-for-the-jan-6-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown by 8 percentage points from 2021 to 2022</a>. Notably, the share of Democrats who said that Trump bore a lot of responsibility for Jan. 6 declined by 11 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, most Democrats still <em>strongly</em> disapprove of Trump’s actions. That Quinnipiac poll found, for instance, that <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87 percent of Democrats</a> thought that Trump had committed a crime. But Americans overall are divided on this question. Ninety percent of Republicans in that poll said that Trump didn’t commit a crime. Independents are split, with 46 percent thinking that Trump committed a crime and 47 percent thinking he did not. Overall, 46 percent of all respondents said they thought Trump had committed a crime, and 48 percent said they thought he did not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This doesn’t mean, though, that Americans — including Republicans — approve of what happened on Jan. 6. In the Navigator poll, for instance, <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Navigator-Toplines-04.05.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 26 percent of Republicans</a> said they supported the actions of those who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, while 65 percent opposed them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But just because most Republicans don’t approve of what happened on Jan. 6 doesn’t mean they support the House committee further investigating it. That Navigator poll found Republicans were equally split between supporting or opposing the committee’s work (45 percent each), while a January Quinnipiac poll of registered voters found that <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60 percent of Republicans opposed the investigation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, regardless of whether they support what happened on Jan. 6 or continuing to investigate it, a majority of Republicans still believe what drew Trump’s supporters to the Capitol in the first place: Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. Support for Trump’s Big Lie has remained consistently high among Republicans — in the first Economist/YouGov conducted after the election, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/9j7sr0my95/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82 percent</a> said President Biden did not legitimately win; <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/9itq17lrr3/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">73 percent</a> said the same in the most recent poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, this paints a picture of a Republican Party that might not fully support what happened on Jan. 6 but is very much ready to move on and, broadly speaking, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/trump-voters-big-lie-stolen-election/629572/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still backs the former president</a>. And with such a large share of Americans having already made up their mind on this issue, it’s hard to imagine a situation in which revelations from the Jan. 6 committee change people’s minds significantly.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/confusion-anger-elation-demise-travel-mask-mandate-divides/story?id=84167392">A judge ruled on Monday</a> that federal mask mandates for airplanes and public transportation were unlawful. Many companies have already moved to lift their mask requirements, but <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/support-for-mask-requirements-in-public-persists-although-worries-about-infection-continue-to-decline/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=support-for-mask-requirements-in-public-persists-although-worries-about-infection-continue-to-decline">the majority of Americans</a> still appear to be in favor of a mask mandate when it comes to public transportation, according to an April 14-18 poll from AP-NORC. Fifty-six percent of adults said they somewhat or strongly favored requiring people to wear face masks when traveling on airplanes, trains and other forms of public transportation. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had elected to extend the federal mask mandate for transportation, just five days before it was struck down, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/20/cdc-mask-mandate-federal-transportation-survey/">59 percent of registered voters approved</a> of the decision according to an April 15-17 poll from Morning Consult/Politico.</li><li>When it comes to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/truck-driver-shortage-biden-administration/">the national long-haul trucker shortage</a>, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of lowering the required minimum age to apply for a commercial driver’s license from 18 to 16 in order to address the issue. According to an April 17-18 poll of registered voters from NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ, <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/polls/full-report-newsnations-survey-on-covid-19-restrictions-immigration/">71 percent of respondents</a> said they were strongly or somewhat opposed to this. Americans didn’t seem to be fond of the prospect of self-driving trucks, either — 65 percent said they would feel not at all or not too safe driving if self-driving trucks were on the road.</li><li>As FiveThirtyEight wrote earlier this week, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-do-gop-lawmakers-still-oppose-legalizing-weed/">support for legalizing marijuana</a> is high across all 50 states. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marijuana-recreational-legalize-opinion-poll-2022-04-20/">a March 29-31 poll from CBS News/YouGov</a>, support for legalization is virtually identical in states where recreational cannabis is legal (66 percent) and where it isn’t (65 percent).</li><li>4/20 isn’t the only thing that has people seeing green — Earth Day is 4/22. When it comes to personal concerns over climate change, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/global-advisor-earth-day-2022">Americans were in the middle of the pack</a> internationally. In a poll of over 23,000 respondents in over 31 countries, conducted Feb. 18-March 4 by Ipsos, 38 percent of Americans said they had worried a great deal or a fair amount over climate change in the last two to three weeks. This was higher than the share in China (28 percent) or Russia (29 percent), but lower than many other countries like France (45 percent) or India (63 percent). Respondents from Latin America were the most concerned about climate change by far, with a majority in every country polled expressing worry about climate change in the last few weeks, ranging from 53 percent in Brazil to 71 percent in Colombia.</li><li><a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/20/rnc-presidential-debates-withdraw/">Republican voters are split</a> on the Republican National Committee’s recent decision to ban GOP presidential candidates from participating in official debates, according to an April 15-17 poll from Morning Consult/Politico. Thirty-seven percent supported this decision, while 34 percent opposed it and 29 percent were undecided. In total, 80 percent of Republicans said it was very or somewhat important for presidential candidates to participate in debates, versus 83 percent of all voters who said the same.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Sunday, French voters will head to the polls once again to choose their president for the next five years. After narrowing down the list of candidates in the first round on April 10, voters will choose between the incumbent, centrist Emmanuel Macron, and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. This runoff will serve as a rematch of the election five years ago, when a relatively unknown Macron won two-thirds of the vote. This time, however, the race appears to be much closer. According to POLITICO Europe’s “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poll of Polls</a>,” 55 percent support Macron and 45 percent support Le Pen.</p>

As Macron has occupied the middle of the political spectrum in France, with a focus on cooperation among European nations, the opposition parties have moved toward a nationalist, populist agenda.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Coming soon to a 2024 Republican presidential primary ad near you: Gov. Ron DeSantis stood up to moderate Republicans who wanted to appease liberal Democrats, and he won.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Thursday, the Florida Legislature finally <a href="https://twitter.com/apantazi/status/1517186221038002178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caved to DeSantis’s wishes</a> and passed one of his proposed congressional maps — the last major piece in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national redistricting puzzle</a>. And befitting DeSantis’s national reputation (and ambitions), it is a dream map for partisan Republicans, single-handedly adding four new Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives. But while DeSantis’s uncompromising insistence on maximizing Republican power may give him a nice story to tell if he runs for president, it could also be the map’s undoing in court.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Florida’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/P000C0109/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soon-to-be congressional map</a> (it will go into effect once DeSantis signs it) creates 18 seats with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> of R+5 or redder and only eight seats with a partisan lean of D+5 or bluer. (The remaining two seats fall into the “highly competitive” category between R+5 and D+5.)</p>

Al Lawson’s North Florida district is completely refigured into a solidly Republican seat. In addition, the new congressional seat that Florida <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained from the 2020 census</a> — numbered the 18th — is dark red under this map, for a GOP gain of four seats in total.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is about <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/florida/#GOP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as big of a Republican bias</a> that Florida’s congressional map could have — and darn close to the most egregiously partisan map in the country. The map has an <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficiency gap</a> of R+20, which means Republicans would be expected to win 20 percent more seats under this map than under a hypothetical, perfectly fair map. Because Florida has 28 congressional seats, that translates to a 5.7-seat Republican bias — right on Texas’s heels for the “honor” of having the biggest bias of any state.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But it didn’t have to be this way. Republicans in the Legislature initially passed maps that were significantly less biased. The state House <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/504273-with-veto-looming-house-passes-a-florida-congressional-map-two-actually/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/H000C8019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">map</a> in March that would have created 15 seats that were R+5 or redder and had an R+13 efficiency gap (though according to the inventors of efficiency gap, that would still qualify as gerrymandered). And in January, the state Senate <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/488460-florida-senate-approves-redistricting-map-for-floridas-28-u-s-house-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/S035C8060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">map</a> that was close enough to fair (an efficiency gap of only R+6) that even most Democratic senators voted for it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But DeSantis <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/501809-ron-desantis-map-veto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledged to veto them both</a>, insisting that only one of his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/P000C0079/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uber-aggressive</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/P000C0094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposals</a> would do. His beef, at least publicly, was that the Legislature’s proposals preserved (in some form or another) Lawson’s blue district, whose <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/FL/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old iteration</a> stretched from Tallahassee to Jacksonville in order to pick up enough Black voters to <a href="https://mcimaps.com/lets-talk-about-the-florida-5th-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give them a voice in Congress</a>. Ironically, <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/508755-gov-desantis-takes-aim-at-fair-districts-amendments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeSantis claimed</a> this violated the 14th Amendment by <a href="https://twitter.com/RRHElections/status/1484312692920025088?s=20&amp;t=fb8wfT48cPhAeXodhJ6Jtg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prioritizing race</a> as the main consideration in drawing the district over other factors like compactness.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first, Republican legislators brushed off DeSantis’s objections. They argued that the “<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Congressional_District_Boundaries,_Amendment_6_(2010)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fair Districts</a>” amendment to the Florida Constitution — a redistricting reform that voters passed in 2010 — required the preservation of a predominantly Black seat in North Florida. And, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/17/florida-republicans-defy-desantis-00009651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already miffed</a> over DeSantis’s strong-arm tactics on redistricting and other issues, they <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2022/01/20/florida-gop-led-senate-sets-up-clash-with-desantis-over-congressional-maps-1406232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firmly pushed back</a> against his maps and <a href="https://jaxtrib.org/2022/02/22/florida-legislature-unite-against-gov-desantis-redistricting-expert-to-protect-black-jacksonville-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his legal arguments</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After DeSantis issued his veto threat, though, they began to <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/02/25/amid-desantis-push-florida-house-releases-redistricting-map-and-a-backup-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make concessions to the governor’s position</a>. For instance, the House’s map made Lawson’s district much more compact by centering it solely on Jacksonville — but it still had a big enough Black population to keep it Democratic-leaning. So DeSantis still claimed it was a racial gerrymander and <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/512310-gov-desantis-vetoes-congressional-map-special-session-on-redistricting-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetoed it</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To many of the <a href="https://mcimaps.substack.com/p/issue-36-the-new-house-redistricting?s=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s critics</a>, this was evidence that DeSantis’s real goal was not an acceptable congressional map, but to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/11/desantis-florida-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burnish his image</a> as a partisan warrior ahead of his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/desantis-gops-rising-star-2024-hopefuls-drill-anti/story?id=83143776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible 2024 presidential run</a>. His refusal to concede districts to the opposing party will surely appeal to Republican primary voters who increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view Democratic power as unacceptable</a>. And to a GOP base that cheers former President Donald Trump’s crusades against “RINOs” (Republicans in name only), DeSantis can offer the compelling argument that he stood up to members of his own party who were insufficiently cutthroat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That argument is even stronger now. After months of staring DeSantis down, last week legislative leaders <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article260313745.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally blinked</a>, saying they would not propose any more maps and would vote on whatever proposal DeSantis submitted to them. It was a total political victory for the governor: Not only did he defeat the Legislature in their battle of wills, but he also didn’t have to concede a single Republican district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, DeSantis’s political victory doesn’t necessarily mean his map will be used in the 2022 election. With Democrats virtually guaranteed to sue over the plan, a court will ultimately decide its fate. And there are <a href="https://mcimaps.substack.com/p/issue-44-a-good-friday-analysis-of?s=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a <em>lot</em> of reasons</a> to think the map is illegal under Florida law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most obviously, Republican legislators were correct when they argued that the Fair Districts amendment requires the preservation of a predominantly Black district in North Florida. Even DeSantis’s top lawyer has <a href="https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SLA-BIZHUB22032912102.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledged</a> that the Fair Districts amendment prohibits significantly decreasing the nonwhite population of a predominantly nonwhite district (in legal parlance, this is known as “retrogression”). But DeSantis’s map does just that. Under the current boundaries, the voting-age population of Lawson’s district is 44 percent Black and 40 percent white. Under the DeSantis map, it is 55 percent white and 30 percent Black.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Lawson’s current district is numbered the 5th, we consider his new district to be the 4th under DeSantis’s map because a plurality (45 percent) of residents of the new 4th are currently Lawson’s constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">North Florida isn’t even the only place where DeSantis’s map short-changes Black voters. The map also splits Orlando’s Black community between the 10th and 11th districts. It’s <a href="https://jaxtrib.org/2022/01/14/florida-legislature-disagrees-on-racial-protections-in-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debatable</a> whether the current 10th District (represented by Democratic Rep. Val Demings) is protected under the Fair Districts amendment, but its new configuration under the DeSantis plan may not elect Black voters’ candidate of choice. According to local Democratic consultant Matthew Isbell, whites are now a <a href="https://twitter.com/MappingFL/status/1514362815762509824?s=20&amp;t=pJ9UAwN_r_6qRYPP6dPt9A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plurality of the electorate</a> in the Democratic primary there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then, of course, there’s the map’s extreme Republican bias, which is also at odds with the Fair Districts amendment. (“No apportionment plan or individual district shall be drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party,” the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A3S20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amendment reads</a>.) Perhaps the clearest example of the lines being drawn with partisan intent is in the Tampa Bay region, where there are currently two Democratic-held seats: the competitive 13th, on the western side of the bay, and the blue 14th, on the eastern side. DeSantis’s plan, however, would have the 14th District cross Tampa Bay to combine Democratic voters on the eastern and western sides into one district, thus moving the 13th from a highly competitive seat to a Republican-leaning one.</p>

How do they know? Because the Florida Supreme Court has said so in the past. In 2015, the court <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=966573952906433631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> Florida’s then-congressional map in part specifically because the 14th District crossed Tampa Bay.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There seems to be little question that Florida’s new congressional map is illegal under state law. So shouldn’t it be a slam dunk that the courts will throw it out? Not necessarily. The courts may agree with DeSantis’s position that the requirements of the Florida Constitution — specifically, its protections of minority districts — are <em>themselves</em> unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. Indeed, DeSantis’s implicit goal is to get the Fair Districts amendment struck down entirely — and this map is his vehicle for doing so. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s uncertain what the Florida Supreme Court will do here. On one hand, the court had no issues enforcing the Fair Districts amendment just seven years ago. On the other, four of the five justices who supported that ruling are now off the court — three of them replaced by DeSantis appointees. But then again, earlier this year, the court <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/10/redistricting-florida-supreme-court-gov-desantis-advisory-opinion-denied-al-lawson-congressional/6735854001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected DeSantis’s request</a> for a preemptive, advisory opinion into whether Lawson’s district was legal, an action that was interpreted as a setback for the governor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the map is struck down, it would obviously be a blow to Republicans — and, presumably, DeSantis by extension. His refusal to budge from his hardline position may, in the end, result in a much better map for Democrats than the one he vetoed from the Legislature. But from a narrative perspective, DeSantis will probably be fine: He can still tell 2024 primary voters that he fought the good fight and blame the end result on other, less uncompromising Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if the court upholds the map, it would be a much more tangible blow to Democrats and Black voters in Florida, who would find themselves with significantly less representation in Congress. And if the court strikes down the Fair Districts amendment in doing so, it would leave those people with no obvious legal recourse. In short, a lot is on the line in Tallahassee right now.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">We’re almost six months from the 2022 midterm election, and Republicans have big dreams for their potential gains. President Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is mired in the low 40s</a>, and the GOP already holds a lead in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot polling</a> that history suggests <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could grow as the election nears</a>. In the race for the Senate, this means that the GOP has a very good shot at gaining <em>at least</em> the one seat it needs to capture the evenly-divided Senate. As such, there’s an especially strong focus on the Republican Senate primaries, as the eventual nominees could be part of a new GOP majority following the November election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We took a look at the Senate contests and broke down the high-profile races into three groups: First, the seven primaries in battleground states, where Republicans will try to either maintain control of competitive GOP-held seats or defeat Democratic incumbents. Second, the four red-state primaries for seats where Republican retirements have set the stage for contentious GOP nomination battles, if not necessarily competitive general elections. And lastly, the two races where incumbent Republican senators face a potentially serious primary challenger. In the table below are the 13 Republican Senate primaries that fall into these categories for the 2022 midterms — a list that could change going forward.</p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<h2><strong>Republican primaries in battleground states</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the seven battleground races in the Senate, the Pennsylvania Senate primary may be the most high profile for the GOP this cycle. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey’s retirement attracted a bevy of candidates to the race, but the GOP field has now developed into a close contest between former hedge fund manager David McCormick and physician and TV personality Mehmet Öz. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both men are <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-david-mccormick-money-pa-2022-senate-race-20220418.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independently wealthy</a> and have largely self-funded their campaigns — Öz <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00638/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has loaned his campaign</a> $11 million, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00661/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McCormick nearly</a> $7 million. But they’ve also received ample help from allied outside groups, which have spent $18.6 million supporting or opposing the two frontrunners in the primary, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=PAS1&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to OpenSecrets</a>. McCormick and his allies <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/21/pro-oz-group-mccormick-ad-527571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tried to cast</a> Öz as a Hollywood celebrity out of touch with conservative values, while Öz and his team <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/ads-attacking-dave-mccormick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have sought to portray</a> McCormick as a wealthy job outsourcer and “friend” of China. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/pennsylvania-2022-gop-poll-david-mccormick-leads-primary-for-u-s-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent polls</a> have shown <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-KHupfGszGbdtV3H7ygDdS8-Mb-0BTUf/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McCormick and Öz</a> running <a href="https://twitter.com/Eagle63/status/1513949280431747080?s=20&amp;t=ajwQ4CZOPgNc6mY3b561cQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neck and neck</a> with about a month to go until the May 17 primary, but it remains to be seen how the latest big development in the race — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/09/trump-leans-toward-dr-oz-in-pennsylvania-senate-race-00024272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Trump’s endorsement of Öz</a> in early April — will affect the contest. The first post-endorsement survey from GOP pollster <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/pa-sen-gop-0415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group found</a> Öz leading McCormick 23 percent to 20 percent, but that was a less substantial lead than Oz’s 11-point advantage over McCormick in <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/pa-sen-gop-survey-0209/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar’s February survey</a>. Moreover, McCormick and Öz haven’t been polling so far ahead of other candidates as to rule out a surge by another contender like conservative activist Kathy Barnette, businessman Jeff Bartos or former Ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bottom line: Whoever advances from the GOP primary faces a highly competitive race in November, likely against either Lt. Gov. John Fetterman or Rep. Conor Lamb on the Democratic side, which is why Pennsylvania’s Senate race is one of the most important battleground races in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In North Carolina, Sen. Richard Burr’s retirement has forced the GOP to defend another open seat in a competitive state, and the Republican primary there has become a head-to-head tilt between Rep. Ted Budd and former Gov. Pat McCrory. Whoever wins could find themselves headed to the Senate, too. Although North Carolina often has close elections, it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leans just red enough</a> that either Republican would likely start out as a slight favorite against former state Supreme Court Justice Cheri Beasley, the presumptive Democratic nominee. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, Budd looks to be the likely favorite as he has Trump’s backing and <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=87274913-881c-42d7-b655-52ef21ac8ab2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most polls</a> have <a href="https://www.johnlocke.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/19371-JLF-NC-Toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put him</a> ahead <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/north-carolina-2022-poll-ted-budd-holds-16-point-lead-in-republican-primary-for-u-s-senate-leads-potential-matchup-against-democrat-cheri-beasley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of McCrory</a>. He also has a clear financial edge thanks to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NCS2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside support</a> from the Club for Growth, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00487470/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which has spent</a> about $8.7 million backing Budd and attacking McCrory. (Both candidates have <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/NC/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> a little over $4 million.) The former governor <a href="https://twitter.com/natalie_allison/status/1513517072998875141" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t giving up</a>, though, as he’s attacked Budd as a D.C. insider and played up his own conservative credentials.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turning now to the five competitive seats held by Democrats, Arizona’s GOP primary field is also quite busy, as <a href="https://apps.arizona.vote/electioninfo/elections/2022-primary-election/federal/2518/32/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five candidates are competing</a> to take on Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. <a href="https://twitter.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1511794690953252876?s=20&amp;t=3qWHdsZacZQB0vpP6ze-JA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent surveys</a> suggest state Attorney General Mark Brnovich and energy executive Jim Lamon <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/az-gop-gov-race-lake-leads-robson-climbing-salmon-stalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be</a> co-frontrunners, but venture capitalist Blake Masters is also in the mix. Brnovich actually <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/state-of-the-arizona-u.s.-senate-contest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once seemed</a> to have a clear lead in this race, but <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2022/01/15/trump-points-a-big-finger-at-brnovich-in-florence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s earned Trump’s antipathy</a> in recent months by failing to aggressively back Trump’s false claims about fraud in the 2020 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Trump <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/18/trump-signals-endorsement-coming-senate-race-but-not-brnovich/7362260001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks likely to endorse someone else here</a>, should he take the plunge. And thanks to their financial edge, Lamon or Masters could be well-positioned to capitalize on such backing. <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AZ00331/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lamon has given his own campaign</a> $13 million, while Masters <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AZ00372/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $3.8 million and garnered $3.5 million <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00777185/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in outside support</a> via a super PAC <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/02/peter-thiel-tied-dark-money-group-helping-bankroll-super-pac-spending-on-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded by</a> billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel. Brnovich, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AZ00356/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only raised</a> $2.5 million, paling in comparison. Money is likely to really matter in this race, too, since the primary winner will need to bring in enough resources to remotely match Kelly’s fundraising prowess (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0AZ00350/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s raised</a> $39 million so far).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic-held seats in Georgia and Nevada will also be extremely competitive in November and, as such, are seeing a fair amount of competition on the GOP side since Trump-endorsed Republicans haven’t entirely cleared the field. In Georgia, former NFL running back Herschel Walker <a href="https://www.cbs46.com/2022/04/14/gop-primary-poll-reveals-front-runners-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is polling</a> at around <a href="https://www.spryresearch.com/so/e9O0aQYU1#/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60 percent</a> in <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/georgia-2022-poll-herschel-walker-leads-senator-warnock-49-to-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his primary</a>, making him the favorite to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. But he might still have some primary problems: Walker’s past <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-herschel-walker-confronts-his-mental-health-domestic-violence-allegations-33b96336-77c1-4b3c-915d-896746c52694.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health struggles</a>, allegations of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violence against women</a> and <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/investigations/herschel-walkers-business-record-reveals-creditor-lawsuits-exaggerated-claims/D3FRT4RA7NFKTN23423ENPUP7A/?link_id=8&amp;can_id=8094ef3ca9e2fe4af466070f61a27eb7&amp;source=email-morning-digest-georgia-republicans-try-to-take-down-herschel-walker-despite-trumps-backing&amp;email_referrer=email_1499145&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-georgia-republicans-try-to-take-down-herschel-walker-despite-trumps-backing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revelations about his business record</a> have encouraged opposition Republican super PACs <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/01/herschel-walker-primary-00022192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to spend millions</a> ahead of the May 24 primary to push his support below 50 percent, which would force a June 21 runoff against either state Agricultural Commissioner Gary Black or former Navy SEAL officer Latham Saddler. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Nevada, meanwhile, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt has <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/donald-trump-endorses-ex-nevada-ag-adam-laxalt-for-senate-2424479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a> and is the frontrunner to take on Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who might be Democrats’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/us/politics/nevada-midterms-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most endangered incumbent</a>. But it’s not clear yet that Laxalt will face off against Masto, as he’s attracted a serious challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/NV/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has managed</a> to raise $3.2 million to Laxalt’s $4.4 million. Granted, the only primary poll we’ve seen <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CfGPAC_NV-Statewide_PollMemo_220320.pdf" target="_blank">found Laxalt way ahead</a>, but it was a poll conducted for the Club for Growth, which has endorsed Laxalt, and as always, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank">we have to be cautious</a> when interpreting partisan polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last in this category are the primaries in Colorado and New Hampshire, where Republicans may also have a shot at defeating Democratic incumbents if the electoral environment is very favorable toward them this fall. There’s a lot of uncertainty in both races at this point, though. The Colorado GOP’s pre-primary convention, for instance, <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/04/09/colorado-senate-race-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent two largely unknown candidates</a> to the primary, while the Republican primary field in New Hampshire <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/bruce-fenton-new-hampshire-gop-senate-race/39596372" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is still developing</a>, partly because popular GOP Gov. Chris Sununu <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/11/09/gov-chris-sununu-not-running-for-new-hampshire-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took a pass on the race</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Red-state Republican primaries where retirements have shaken up the field</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In four more states, GOP retirements have set the stage for crowded primary fields. These states won’t be as competitive in November as the previous category, but who wins in each of these states is important for the future of the GOP. And of these four contests, Ohio’s Senate primary is probably the most high-profile. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The contest to succeed retiring Sen. Rob Portman is both crowded and costing everyone a pretty penny. Three of the candidates have done a lot of self-funding — state Sen. Matt Dolan to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OH00477/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the tune of $10.5 million</a>; businessman Mike Gibbons, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S8OH00086/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16.6 million</a>; and former Ohio GOP Chairwoman Jane Timken, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OH00360/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 million</a> — and then two other candidates have benefited from millions <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=OHS2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in outside spending</a>, former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and venture capitalist and author J.D. Vance. (Pro-Mandel PACs and super PACs have spent about $9.5 million aiding him, while pro-Vance groups have boosted their candidate with $7.6 million).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polling-wise, the race has been a bit of a “<a href="https://suggestedreads.com/best-choose-your-own-adventure-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose Your Own Adventure</a>” story, too, because nearly every poll has been sponsored by a campaign — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-primary-polls-so-far-are-internal-polls-thats-a-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most of any Senate race in the country</a>. Most polls have put Mandel or Gibbons in the lead, but their advantage is hardly insurmountable; they typically earn less than 25 percent support. The race might also now take a turn: Last Friday, Vance <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/15/1093148912/trump-endorses-j-d-vance-wading-into-ohios-contentious-republican-senate-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned Trump’s endorsement</a>. No polls have been released since then, but at the very least, the Trump endorsement has already <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/19/thiel-pumps-another-3-5m-into-vance-super-pac-after-trump-endorsement-00026375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned Vance’s super PAC</a> another $3.5 million in donations from Thiel, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22332045/peter-thiel-jd-vance-ohio-senate-donation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has bankrolled</a> Vance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An even uglier GOP primary is playing out in Missouri, where Sen. Roy Blunt is retiring. This race <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senate-elections-st-louis-coronavirus-pandemic-missouri-tigers-mens-basketball-eric-greitens-34bcb44de0235873c32f4f2f22666253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has centered around</a> disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned in 2018 after being indicted by a grand jury over his alleged threat of blackmail against a woman with whom he’d had an extramarital affair, in addition to separate criminal charges against him for alleged campaign finance violations. But with high name recognition in the state and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/06/gop-megadonor-eric-greitens-498347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super PAC backed by</a> conservative megadonor Richard Uihlein, Greitens could win, which has given <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eric-greitens-seeks-comeback-missouri-us-senate-gop-4e77ad06d66767365bfcdfee62bb0ef0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national and state Republican leaders fits</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are other major contenders in this race: Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, Rep. Vicky Hartzler and Rep. Billy Long, with each of them <a href="https://www.ky3.com/2022/03/11/gop-split-alternative-greitens-missouri-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to position themselves</a> as the top anti-Greitens choice. But so far, no one has jumped ahead. <a href="https://twitter.com/politicoalex/status/1513570590581477378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most recent</a> surveys <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/11/greitens-hartzler-missouri-senate-race-00024351" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have found</a> Greitens <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/mo-sen-gop-0329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running neck and neck</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/kcmikemahoney/status/1507714530134175752?s=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schmitt and Hartzler</a> (and with Long in a distant fourth). GOP worries about Greitens have also only continued to grow with <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/greitens-accusations-gop-senate-bids/63-82dd88e1-185f-4577-a93a-cdf98f4322b7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greitens’s ex-wife</a> alleging that he acted violently toward her and their children. A Trump endorsement might be enough to break the logjam, but Trump hasn’t weighed in yet, and we’re still a long way from the Aug. 2 primary, so there could be many more twists and turns in the Show Me State.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two other red states, Alabama and Oklahoma, also have open-seat Republican primaries of note, and both could head to runoffs. In Alabama, the May 24 primary to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Shelby features a three-way race involving former Shelby chief of staff Katie Britt, Rep. Mo Brooks and Army veteran Mike Durant. Brooks initially had the upper hand, thanks in part to Trump’s endorsement, but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/17/politics/brooks-trump-alabama-senate-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his flailing campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mo-brooks-is-disappointing-trump-mulls-pulling-alabama-senate-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inconsistent backing</a> of false claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/03/23/donald-trump-withdraws-endorsement-mo-brooks-alabama-senate/7139178001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompted Trump to un-endorse Brooks</a> in late March. The <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/durant-leads-britt-in-new-senate-poll-brooks-far-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited polling</a> suggests Durant and Britt <a href="https://1819news.com/news/item/poll-reveals-tight-race-for-u-s-senate-03-23-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are now the likeliest pairing</a> to advance to a runoff. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Oklahoma, Sen. Jim Inhofe’s <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/02/25/inhofe-tells-newspaper-he-will-step-aside-at-years-end-and-support-aide-for-his-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resignation precipitated a special election</a> that has attracted a big field, making a runoff a real possibility.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhofe’s resignation will &lt;a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/oklahoma-sen-jim-inhofe-to-announce-resignation-report-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;take effect&lt;/a&gt; on Jan. 3, 2023, meaning the winner of the special election will take office at the start of the next Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a> Rep. Markwayne Mullin led <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60099f1f6ffad96a2d94bf98/t/6244cdc1a7aa820e29da4d52/1648676290494/Toplines_Oklahoma+GOP+Statewide+Poll_March+2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a late-March poll</a> from GOP pollster Amber Integrated with 39 percent, followed by former state House speaker T.W. Shannon at 14 percent, but former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2022/04/15/scott-pruitt-trump-cabinet-joins-race-replace-jim-inhofe-us-senate-oklahoma/7333886001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered the race</a> right before the filing deadline, further muddying the waters.</p>



<h2><strong>The Republican incumbents with notable intraparty challengers</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, there are two primaries involving Republican incumbents that are worth keeping an eye on. First up, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who must <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/04/12/kelly-tshibaka-backed-by-trump-officially-files-for-senate-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face down an intraparty challenge</a> from Trump-endorsed Kelly Tshibaka, the former commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Administration. It’s hard to know how much trouble Murkowski is in at this point, as the race <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be decided by a top-four primary</a> wherein each voter will cast a single vote for a ballot that features all candidates, regardless of party, and the top-four finishers will advance to the general election where ranked-choice voting will decide the winner. It’s likely Murkowski and Tshibaka advance to the general, though, and this is where the real action will take place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, the GOP primary in Arkansas has attracted notice because Sen. John Boozman’s principal opponent, Army veteran and former NFL player Jake Bequette, has managed to raise <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=ARS2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> while a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00790071/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super PAC backing him</a> has also brought in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/14/arkansas-senator-boozman-gop-megadonor-516043" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 million in funding from Uihlein</a>, the big-time GOP donor. Although Boozman has Trump’s backing, Bequette and his allies <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/arkansas-senate-race-bequette-boozman-establishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tried to make the case</a> that Bequette is more pro-Trump than the incumbent. Boozman will probably be fine, but Uihlein’s involvement and Bequette’s fundraising make this race at least a bit interesting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Obviously, there is a lot to keep track of! But critically, these Republican primaries will help shape both key battleground contests that will decide control of the Senate as well as the future makeup of the GOP caucus.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (April 22, 2022, 12:05 p.m.):</strong> An earlier version of this article mistakenly described a Nevada primary survey as an internal poll released by the Laxalt campaign. It was actually a poll sponsored by the Republican super PAC Club for Growth.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Today is 4/20, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/19/18484698/what-is-420-meaning-marijuana-legalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the holiday</a> for stoners and weed enthusiasts around the world. Legalizing marijuana is no longer a fringe issue championed mainly by those partaking in the day’s festivities either. Over the past two decades, we’ve seen a remarkable rise in support for legalization. Polls over the past year from <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/cannabis_legal?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civiqs</a>, Quinnipiac and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/356939/support-legal-marijuana-holds-record-high.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> show that roughly 7 in 10 American adults think the use of cannabis should be legal, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/14/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double the share</a> who thought so 20 years ago. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, a majority of registered voters in all 50 states now favor making cannabis legal, according to <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/cannabis_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;map=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state-level polling data from Civiqs</a>. Support ranges from a low of 52 percent in North Dakota to a high of 81 percent in Vermont and Washington. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Most adults in every state think marijuana should be legal" aria-label="Map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/10pY7/14/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="595" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This widespread support is rapidly changing the landscape of marijuana prohibition, too. Just 10 years ago, the use and distribution of cannabis for recreational purposes was illegal across the entire country. But since 2012, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/where-is-pot-legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized the recreational use of marijuana</a>, and <a href="https://boardroom.tv/cannabis-legalization-by-state-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful more are expected to follow soon</a>. This month, meanwhile, the U.S. House <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-set-pass-legislation-decriminalizing-marijuana/story?id=83763719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed legislation</a> that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not everyone is on board with those policy changes, though. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/3-republicans-legalize-marijuana-cannabis-2-democrats-vote-against-2022-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over 200 House Republicans voted against the legislation</a>, while only three voted for it. (By comparison, over 200 House Democrats voted for the legislation, while only two voted against it.) That partisan opposition means the bill will <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weed-legalization-unlikely-to-pass-senate-180550123.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost certainly die in the U.S. Senate</a>. After all, Democrats need at least 10 GOP senators to join them in breaking a filibuster. Moreover, even less-controversial marijuana legislation — such as allowing cannabis-related businesses access to the banking system — has <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/02/07/house-takes-its-sixth-hit-on-cannabis-banking-provisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly failed</a> among Republicans in the Senate. With <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/several-gop-senators-oppose-legalizing-pot-following-more-act-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several GOP senators</a> already expressing their disapproval of the bill, this legislation is likely destined to suffer the same fate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">GOP lawmakers’ ongoing opposition to legalization is clearly at odds with the viewpoints of many Americans, as most voters now support legalizing marijuana for recreational use. But congressional Republicans are also increasingly out of step with their own rank-and-file members, as it’s <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/cannabis_legal?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;net=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans disproportionately driving</a> the most recent uptick in support for legalizing marijuana, according to polling from Civiqs.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Opponents of legalization are at odds with voters of all parties" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5E7Zm/14/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, you can see in the chart above that Republicans are still much more likely than Democrats or independents to oppose marijuana legalization. But net support for legalizing marijuana also rose twice as much among Republicans as it did among Democrats and independents over the past four years. Since April 1, 2018, net support for legal cannabis (support for legalization minus opposition to legalization) increased by 11 percentage points and 13 points among Democrats and independents, respectively. Republicans’ net support for legalization, in the meantime, grew from -15 points at the start of April 2018 to a high of +13 points at the end of March. (As of Sunday, net support among Republicans was +12 points.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other polling indicates solid GOP support for legalization, too. A 62 percent majority of Republicans surveyed by <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release?releaseid=3809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac</a> in 2021 said that marijuana should be made legal in the U.S., a whopping +30 points in net support. In a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/356939/support-legal-marijuana-holds-record-high.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> poll conducted the same year, Republicans were split on the issue, with net support for legalization at +1. <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/cannabis_legal?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;map=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statewide polling from Civiqs</a> similarly found that more Republicans favor legal cannabis than oppose it in almost every state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So why exactly, then, aren’t more congressional Republicans representing their own voters’ views on this issue? One possibility is that many of these lawmakers simply don’t know how much Republicans’ opinions have changed. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/bias-in-perceptions-of-public-opinion-among-political-elites/2EF080E04D3AAE6AC1C894F52642E706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political science research shows</a> that politicians tend to overestimate their constituents’ support for conservative policies, with Republican lawmakers driving much of this phenomenon. Some congressional Republicans may therefore oppose federal legalization because they mistakenly believe they’re representing their own voters’ views.       </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other members, however, are likely voting based on their <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/27/republicans-weed-496390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own personal opposition</a> to marijuana legalization. Compared with most Americans, congressional Republicans tend to be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/politics/congress-age/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/01/04/faith-on-the-hill-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more religious</a>, two demographic groups that are far more averse to legalization than <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/16/americans-overwhelmingly-say-marijuana-should-be-legal-for-recreational-or-medical-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">younger</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/26/religious-americans-are-less-likely-to-endorse-legal-marijuana-for-recreational-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religiously unaffiliated Americans</a>. Indeed, GOP politicians often oppose drug legalization on behalf of conservative principles like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/jeff-sessionss-war-marijuana.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">morality</a>, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/gop-congresswomans-marijuana-legalization-bill-draws-fire-from-home-state-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order</a> and <a href="https://cnsnews.com/article/washington/emily-robertson/sens-cruz-lankford-cannabis-harmful-there-human-cost-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family values</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of the reasons, though, Democrats would be wise to make congressional Republicans’ opposition to marijuana legalization an issue in the upcoming midterm elections. As I noted two years ago, not only is legalization <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/20/why-joe-biden-could-swing-votes-by-campaigning-legalize-marijuana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular across the political spectrum</a>, but political science research shows that it’s also one of the more important issues to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/upshot/impeachment-biggest-issue-voters-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats, Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/upshot/independent-voters-important-issues.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independents</a>. Every 4/20, in fact, it becomes more and more apparent that marijuana legalization is a winning political issue.     </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (April 19, 10:05 a.m.):</strong> Late Monday, former President Trump <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/greenville/politics/trump-backs-timmons-norman-in-sc-congressional-races/article_a6c7cec0-bf5e-11ec-9da7-1bd679e0ca2f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced two more endorsements</a> in a pair of South Carolina House races. With these endorsements, Trump has endorsed 103 candidates for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and state governorships so far. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Read more from Jean and Nathaniel on Trump’s 2022 endorsement strategy.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Normally, a one-term presidency would be a sign for a political party to move away, regroup and pivot away from a losing brand. But Donald Trump is not a conventional former president. With the 2022 primary season beginning to pick up in earnest — not counting Texas’s runoff elections, 12 more states will be holding their primaries in May — Trump’s continued influence in the GOP is again being put to the test.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s tricky for Trump, though, as he must thread the needle of maintaining his hold on the party while at the same associating his name with winning — in other words, not reminding voters of his 2020 election loss. He’s largely done this by backing some candidates who seem sure bets to win their primaries as well as supporting his fiercest allies, those who advocate the Big Lie (the idea that he actually won the 2020 election). We last <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked at Trump’s endorsements back in December</a>, and while many parts of his strategy appear to be the same — namely, he’s still endorsing a <em>lot</em> of candidates — there are signs that Trump is being more selective in who he backs.</p>



<h2><strong>Trump’s endorsements show no sign of slowing down</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">When we took a look at Trump’s endorsements last year, we observed he was endorsing more candidates early on in the cycle. By Dec. 7, 2021, he had endorsed 46 candidates for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and state governorships<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including state Rep. Steve Carra, who has since dropped out of his congressional race, and Rep. Mo Brooks, whom Trump has since un-endorsed for Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> — more than three times as many as he had endorsed at that point in the 2020 election cycle. It wouldn’t have been surprising, then, to see the former president take an endorsement breather — but that’s not what happened. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, Trump has continued to endorse at a furious pace. As of April 18, he has endorsed 103 Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding Carra and Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> whereas by April 18, 2020, he had endorsed only 42 candidates for those offices.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Trump has doubled down on early endorsements" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qTaBe/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="449" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">After a brief plateau in January — Trump endorsed only six Senate, House or gubernatorial candidates — Trump really ramped up his endorsements in the new year. He endorsed more such candidates in February (20) than he has in any other month this cycle. Then he endorsed nine candidates in March, and 14 more in the first 18 days of April. In total, he’s now made almost as many endorsements for Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates in the first few months of 2022 (49) than he did in all of 2021 (55).<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including Carra and Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a></p>



<h2><strong>But Trump is making safer endorsements</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump may not be slowing down in his endorsements, but we have observed a change in strategy. Back in December, we noted that almost half of the endorsements Trump had made to that point carried political risk: 43 percent (20 out of 46) of his Senate, House and governor endorsements<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including Carra and Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> were of non-incumbents in contested Republican primaries, meaning they weren’t necessarily locks to win. But since then, only 22 percent (13 out of 59) of Trump’s Senate, House and governor endorsements have been of non-incumbents in contested Republican primaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Trump has been loading up on “safe” endorsements, like on April 6 when he endorsed seven incumbent Republican representatives, none of whom are especially likely to lose their primaries. (Incumbents <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rarely lose in primaries</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, this was a return to form for Trump, who endorsed only 25 non-incumbents in contested Senate, House and governor primaries in the 2020 cycle — 22 percent of his total endorsements for those offices. Perhaps he realized that, after endorsing so many candidates who may very well lose, he needed to bet on some safer horses in order to maintain the appearance that he is still a kingmaker in Republican primaries. After all, we know he still cares about that perception because he boasted just last month about his <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2022/03/05/trump-boasts-he-went-33-0-in-texas-primary-ignoring-ag-ken-paxton-and-four-others-who-face-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 percent win rate in the Texas primary</a> (if you ignore that five of his endorsees were forced into runoffs). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as we’ve written in the past, Trump’s high win rate has always been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificially inflated by easy wins</a>, and Texas was no exception: Seven of the 19 Republicans Trump endorsed for House or governor in the Lone Star State were running unopposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Trump may even be selectively changing his endorsements after making them to keep his win rate up and distance himself from candidates he’s afraid might lose. Take Rep. Mo Brooks, who in <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/endorsement-of-mo-brooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 2021</a> earned Trump’s endorsement for U.S. Senate in Alabama but has been <a href="https://www.wbrc.com/2022/03/22/durant-leads-britt-with-brooks-distant-3rd-exclusive-new-gray-tvala-daily-news-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">languishing at a distant third in the polls</a>. Reports began to emerge that Trump was <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/598808-trump-mulls-rescinding-endorsement-of-brooks-in-alabama-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with Brooks’s performance</a>, and on March 23, he officially <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/03/trump-pulls-mo-brooks-endorsement-new-alabama-senate-endorsement-coming-soon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rescinded his endorsement</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Trump is endorsing more Big Lie supporters</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s abandonment of Brooks is interesting, as Trump has largely been endorsing Republicans who agree with his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. On that front, Brooks is one of the Big Lie’s biggest supporters. Brooks was <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2020/12/02/the-gops-electoral-mischief-491033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first member of Congress</a> who said he would challenge the election results, and he also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/10/mo-brooks-jan6-eric-swalwell-lawsuit-insurrection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke at the Jan. 6 rally</a> before the attack on the U.S. Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what it means to support the Big Lie is an ever-evolving litmus test, and Brooks seems to have made a grievous miscalculation in telling his supporters to put Trump’s 2020 election loss behind them at an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9ZxQsggbM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 2021 rally</a>. <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-kgcbf8ez9e1768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump cited this</a> as the reason for why he was no longer supporting Brooks, though of course it’s impossible to disentangle the role Brooks’s sagging poll numbers played in Trump’s decision, as we know Trump <a href="https://time.com/6160419/donald-trump-mo-brooks-un-endorse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loves a winner</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Brooks’s fall from grace aside, a belief in the Big Lie has been perhaps the most consistent part of Trump’s endorsements since the 2020 election. Of the 111 candidates he’s endorsed for governor, federal office, attorney general or secretary of state,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding Carra and Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> at least 80 — more than 70 percent — believe that the 2020 election was fraudulent, according to our research. (To make our determinations, we checked whether Trump’s endorsees had, if members of Congress, voted against certifying the election results, and whether they had taken a public stance on the issue via news reports and their social media pages. Candidates who more generally raised questions about voter fraud or wanted to increase scrutiny of voting practices weren’t included in our totals.)</p>

 <p>To determine whether a candidate supported Trump’s false claims that he won the 2020 election, we checked whether Trump’s endorsees had voted against certifying the election results and whether they had taken a public stance on the issue via news reports and their social media pages.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Support for the Big Lie is particularly prominent in the candidates Trump has endorsed for the House, as we identified that 81 percent (58 out of 72) of the candidates Trump has backed believe in the Big Lie.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding Carra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> In Trump’s endorsements for Senate and governors’ races, though, support for the Big Lie isn’t quite as pronounced. Just six out of the 17 candidates Trump has endorsed for the Senate support the Big Lie, and nine out of 14 gubernatorial candidates do.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as we wrote in December, what’s really notable about Trump’s endorsements this cycle is he’s also taking the unusual step of endorsing election officials — most notably, election officials who buy into Trump’s lie that the election was stolen from him. So far, Trump has endorsed three secretary of state candidates (all Big Lie believers) in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan, states that flipped from Trump in 2016 to President Biden in 2020, and where all three incumbent secretaries of state <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-08/secretaries-of-state-election-security-trump-michigan-georgia-arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certified their state’s results</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump has taken a similar approach in attorney general races, where four out of five of his endorsed candidates believe that the 2020 election was fraudulent. His two incumbent endorsees, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/10/politics/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-supreme-court-case/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ken Paxton</a> in Texas and <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2020/12/09/floridaa-ashley-moody-backs-texas-challenge-election-results/3871989001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashley Moody</a> in Florida, both joined a failed lawsuit that tried to overturn the election results, and two non-incumbent endorsees also hail from states Trump narrowly lost in 2020, Georgia and Michigan. (The fifth endorsee, Tim Griffin, an attorney general candidate in Arkansas, hasn’t taken a stance on the 2020 election publicly.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These endorsements are notable, not only because these races don’t usually attract national attention, but because they also most clearly break with Trump’s pattern of choosing safer, incumbent candidates. Of the eight candidates Trump has endorsed so far for secretary of state or attorney general, six are non-incumbents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s still an open question at this point about how consequential Trump’s endorsements will be. Most Republicans still have a favorable view of Trump, but there are signs <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/10/politics/donald-trump-republican-primary-2022/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his popularity is slipping</a>. Moreover, we’ve already gotten some mixed signals with his endorsement track record. In the three special elections Trump weighed in on last year, his preferred candidate <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/29/jake-ellzey-donald-trump-texas-6-congressional-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost in Texas</a>, but <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/government/elections-local/gop-candidate-endorsed-by-trump-wins-ohio-15th-congressional-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won in Ohio</a> and <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/03/20/trump-backed-julia-letlow-wins-special-election-for-seat-late-husband-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana</a>. His endorsement record could be further complicated this year, too, if he continues to rescind endorsements as he did with Brooks or endorse competing candidates <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2022/03/11/trump-endorses-huizenga-reelection-4th-district/7009427001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like he did with state Rep. Steve Carra and U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga</a> in Michigan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s too early at this point to conclude anything about Trump’s endorsement track record, but as we keep moving through the primary season, we’ll be keeping a close eye on what Trump’s endorsements mean for the future of the Republican Party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The San Francisco Chronicle <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/dianne-feinstein-senate-17079487.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published an article</a> on Thursday in which a number of Democratic lawmakers and aides suggested that, at age 88, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein was no longer fit to serve due to a significant decline in mental acuity. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses the politically thorny issue of mental acuity in an increasingly elderly U.S. government and what Americans think about age limits for public office.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also continue to track the types of candidates former President Trump has endorsed in the 2022 Republican primaries. So far, he has endorsed over 100 Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates, which is not only more than he endorsed as president in 2020 but also highly unusual for a former president. One of the common themes among the candidates he’s thrown his weight behind is that they have sown distrust in the results of the 2020 election. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-oklahoma-law-87880e9f3c7bde2ae634cb2f02839e6e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a law</a> outlawing abortion in the state. If it isn’t blocked by the courts, the legislation — which has no exceptions for rape or incest — would be one of the harshest measures to become law at a time when anti-abortion lawmakers are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2022/abortion-rights-protections-restrictions-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but competing with each other</a> to pass new restrictions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in a sense, Oklahoma legislators who want to end abortion don’t have much more to do in their state. New data exclusively analyzed by FiveThirtyEight shows that it’s already very difficult to get an abortion appointment in Oklahoma — and it has nothing to do with the state’s new ban. Ever since the Supreme Court allowed a highly restrictive abortion law <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to go into effect</a> in Texas last September, Oklahoma’s four abortion clinics <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-business-texas-oklahoma-65225decf918b820801d162f14b09b80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been overrun</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/26/us/oklahoma-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demand from out-of-state patients</a>. When a team of academic researchers posed as pregnant people and called the Oklahoma clinics at the beginning of March, all four told the callers they couldn’t schedule them for an appointment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As is the case for all the data, it’s possible that someone calling at another time would have gotten a different answer. When FiveThirtyEight reached out to the four Oklahoma clinics last week, one administrator said in an email, “Our wait times at the beginning of March for the [abortion] pill was about 3 weeks and for surgical procedure about 3-4 weeks. … We did not stop scheduling at any point.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless, the impact of the Texas ban isn’t just being felt in Oklahoma. According to the research, waits of two or three weeks for an abortion appointment are common in eight states surrounding Texas — much longer than the waits in states further away.</p>

Doing so would open the door for many more states to restrict abortion and would likely overwhelm the facilities in neighboring states — clinics that are often overburdened as it is.<strong> </strong>A ruling that limits or overturns abortion rights would disturb the fragile equilibrium abortion providers have created, throwing the entire system into chaos. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight analyzed wait-time data for hundreds of abortion providers collected by Middlebury College economics professor <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/econ/faculty_staff_officehours/node/52341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caitlin Myers</a> and <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/txpep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin</a>.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myers has testified as an expert witness on behalf of abortion-rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> To get a comprehensive picture of how long people must wait for the procedure, Myers and a team of student researchers at Middlebury called 737 abortion facilities in 44 states and the District of Columbia, which represent most of the country’s providers that publicly advertise abortion.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://osf.io/8dg7r/wiki/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Myers’s Abortion Facility Database&lt;/a&gt; identifies the names and locations of all facilities that publicly advertise abortion services or might otherwise be identifiable to people looking for an abortion. The database is up to date as of February 23, 2022. Occasionally, when facilities were difficult to reach by phone, the researchers checked appointment availability via the facility’s online scheduler, if it had one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a> Data for 42 additional providers in the remaining six states came from researchers at the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/txpep/files/2021/11/TxPEP-brief-SB8-inital-impact.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who have been conducting similar surveys</a> of abortion providers in these states since Texas’s ban went into effect.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myers’s survey protocol was based on the Texas Policy Evaluation Project’s protocol to ensure that the results were comparable. She combined her research with their research, rather than calling the clinics herself, to avoid unnecessarily burdening providers with additional calls. In total, 34 clinics (4 percent) refused to provide appointment information and 20 clinics (3 percent) said they provided abortion but could not schedule an appointment. Most of the calls from both sets of researchers were made between March 1 and March 22, 2022, but some data from a handful of clinics in Maine was collected on April 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> In the calls, the researchers posed as potential patients, saying they were about six weeks pregnant and wanted the soonest possible appointment for an abortion.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The callers identified themselves as local to the area and between the ages of 19 and 24. They asked for the earliest appointment for both medication and surgical abortions. The wait time was calculated based on the soonest available appointment for either type of abortion. For clinics where a pre-abortion consultation was required, the wait time was calculated based on the soonest available appointment for a consultation, plus any state-imposed waiting period. In some cases, patients may end up waiting longer than the state’s required minimum time between consultation and procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The data shows that while clinics in the states surrounding Texas are particularly taxed right now, wait times of a week or more are already fairly common in other parts of the U.S., even in deep-blue states like California and New York.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of metropolitan areas (or core-based statistical areas) was conducted using 2020 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Nineteen providers were not in a metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

People in red states won’t be the only ones affected if Roe v. Wade is overturned. “States where abortion is still legal will become destinations for people seeking abortions, and the residents of those states will find it hard to get appointments too,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For now, some abortion providers could get patients in quickly — but not many. Only 19 percent of the providers had appointments on the same day or the next weekday.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the story, we refer to weekdays. Not all of the clinics were called on the same day of the week, and some clinics may be closed on weekends. We’ve chosen to exclude weekend days to allow for a more accurate comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> More providers were able to offer an appointment between two and five weekdays (42 percent). But one-third (32 percent) of clinics had a wait time of at least a week, including 12 percent where the first available appointment was more than two weeks away.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="964" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="1216" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4m.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4m.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4m.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4m.png?w=1240 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">There are some factors that may not be captured in the data. In addition to the fact that availability can shift from day to day, it’s possible that clinics might have worked to squeeze in a patient further along in her pregnancy, which means that waits might have been shorter in some cases. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than a dozen states</a> require an in-person counseling appointment before an abortion, and some clinics gave the researchers a date for the consultation but not a date for when the abortion would take place. So there might be even more of a delay if the procedure couldn’t be scheduled right away. Other unpredictable changes can also have an effect — for example, a spokesperson for several clinics in Delaware said waits were longer that week because various doctors’ vacations and leaves coincided.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it was clear that many of the country’s abortion providers are already stretched thin. Myers told me that it surprised her “how much time [the researchers] spent dealing with busy phone lines, returning dropped calls, being on hold for half an hour or more, being told to try back later.” Those challenges — much like a state’s abortion restrictions — are especially burdensome for low-income people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even a delay of a week can have a serious impact on a person seeking an abortion, according to <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/about/staff/liza-fuentes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liza Fuentes</a>, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. For one thing, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-can-expect-if-abortion-pills-become-their-only-safe-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medication abortion</a> is available at many clinics through the 10th week of pregnancy — after that, patients can get only an in-clinic procedure, which might not be their preference. And it seems likely that if delays mount, more patients will get abortions <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/txpep/releases/wait-times-release.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in their second trimester</a>. That’s relevant because <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the price of an abortion also generally goes up</a> as the pregnancy progresses, particularly after the first trimester, <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/treatments/surgical-abortion-second-trimester" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the procedure gets more complicated</a>. And although abortion is extremely safe overall, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/S0968-8080%2808%2931379-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the risk of complications is a little higher</a> later in pregnancy. “By delaying the procedure, we’re forcing pregnant people to take on additional risks,” Fuentes said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the clinics with the longest wait times are in states where abortion is heavily restricted. The first available appointment at Missouri’s lone clinic, for example, was more than a month away. In Arkansas, where there are only two clinics, the earliest appointment was nearly three weeks away. That’s a huge increase from September, when, <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/txpep/files/2022/03/TxPEP-out-of-state-SB8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project’s data</a>, a person seeking an abortion in Arkansas could get an appointment the next day. “It was already hard to provide abortion those states,” said <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/information-science/amanda-stevenson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda Stevenson</a>, a sociology professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder who has previously worked on research related to abortion wait times. She reviewed a summary of the analysis before publication. “The fact that the waits aren’t even longer is the result of herculean efforts on the part of providers around Texas to accommodate the increased demand.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It took a few months after the Texas ban went into effect, but Williams’s clinic is now stretched far beyond its normal operating capacity, she said. Like many abortion providers in the South and Midwest, Little Rock Family Planning Services isn’t open every day. Abortion is highly regulated in Arkansas, so adding more appointments means more work to ensure the clinic is in compliance, and it’s hard to find and train more staff in a short time, particularly in the midst of broader shortage of health care workers. And then there are physical-space limitations. “There are only so many people you can fit in the building,” Williams said, adding that the whole situation is profoundly stressful for her, the clinic staff and the people they’re trying to serve. “It’s this ever-increasing thing that you’re chasing,” she said. “There’s just not enough appointments to service the patients who are needing care.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Roe is overturned or restricted this year, many abortion providers will find themselves in a similar position. After all, abortion clinics are businesses built around the demand they expect to have. A sudden, unpredictable influx of patients isn’t easy to accommodate, even in states less restrictive than Arkansas. “There’s a lot of science that goes into the appointment-making,” said <a href="https://www.wholewomanshealth.com/message-from-our-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Hagstrom Miller</a>, the CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, which has clinics in Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Texas and Virginia. “We don’t want to make people have a super long wait time. We don’t want to have people sitting on the floor. You want to maintain a commitment to health care with dignity and respect.” Finding a new space to see patients can be difficult. Some providers are expanding their services through telemedicine, but that still takes time and additional personnel. Nothing about offering more abortions is easy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The uncertainty of what the Supreme Court will do — and how many patients will need care — adds another layer of complication. “It feels like without knowing what’s coming, you’re behind,” said Dr. Kristina Tocce, medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. “Because you can’t build out elaborate plans without knowing what’s actually needed.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Further restricting abortion will affect people all over the country, including in blue states. In fact, that may already be happening. Even in states where abortion access is protected, there were clinics with long waits in the data we analyzed. Thirty-one percent of clinics in New York and 67 percent of clinics in Oregon, for example, had a wait time of more than a week. This was particularly pronounced for clinics in rural areas, but more densely populated areas weren’t immune. In seven metropolitan areas — about 3 percent of metro areas with clinics — there were no abortion clinics scheduling an appointment at the time researchers contacted them. In an additional 30 metropolitan areas — about 13 percent — the earliest appointment was more than two weeks away. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Chicago, the median wait time for an appointment was almost a week, and three of the city’s 14 abortion providers didn’t have an opening for more than two weeks.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the 14 did not provide scheduling information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/hillary-mclaren" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Hillary McLaren</a>, an abortion provider in Chicago, told me that her clinic has seen an uptick in patients from Texas over the past few months. These days, she said, it’s common for the earliest appointment to be two weeks away. “Chicago is a big city with a lot of abortion access, but we’re surrounded by states where it’s restricted — Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan,” she said. As more people travel to Chicago for abortions, that means fewer appointments for local patients. “We’re already seeing that ripple effect — patients who are based here are less able to get care,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Colorado, the competition for appointments was even more intense. Two of the state’s 21 clinics had no openings at all, and the median wait for an appointment was over a week. This is almost certainly related to the Texas ban. According to data shared with FiveThirtyEight, Planned Parenthood’s Colorado clinics saw 44 patients from Texas between September 2020 and March 2021. During the same period a year later, they saw 506 Texas patients. For clinics that see a couple dozen patients per day, that kind of increase can be very hard to handle, and the lag in appointment availability is likely affecting Colorado residents too, potentially even forcing them to seek care outside their state. “I’ve had colleagues in other states telling me that for the first time in their careers, they’re seeing patients from Colorado coming to their clinics,” Tocce said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The turmoil that the Texas ban has caused underscores just how messy things could get, depending on what the Supreme Court does in a few months. Many more states <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will outlaw abortion</a>, given the chance. And if that happens, long waits are likely to become the new normal, adding to the difficulties that people trying to get an abortion will face. Some people may not be able to get an abortion at all. “There’s just no way that 20 states can care for the people that currently are getting care in 50 states,” Hagstrom Miller said. “Providers can do as much as we can to jump through all the hoops, open our doors, build capacity — but we cannot fix this problem.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">A fresh wave of COVID-19 cases <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/04/09/gridiron-covid-pelosi-bowser-garland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swept through the U.S. Capitol last week</a>, affecting a number of officials at <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/07/1066212755/speaker-nancy-pelosi-has-tested-positive-for-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest levels of government</a> just as President Biden’s administration <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/bidens-return-normal-covid-strategy-faces-new-test-funding-stalls-rcna20522" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urges for a return to normalcy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just Capitol Hill that’s seeing a fresh round of COVID-19 infections. The <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant</a> has led to an <a href="https://turnto10.com/news/coronavirus/stealth-omicron-ba2-variant-rhode-island-department-health-new-england-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uptick in new cases across the Northeast</a>. The New York Times’s tracker shows that cases for New York City <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-city-new-york-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have risen by over 60 percent</a>, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/washington-district-of-columbia-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cases rising over 140 percent</a> in Washington, D.C., over the same period. But according to recent polling, a majority of Americans are still ready to put the pandemic behind them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Per the latest <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index</a>, the number of Americans partaking in activities outside of their homes is on the rise. As of April 8-11, 65 percent of respondents reported going out to eat recently, while another 66 percent said they’ve visited with friends or family. That’s a sharp uptick from January, the survey noted, when only 46 percent and 50 percent of Americans, respectively, said the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, a dwindling number of people are in favor of taking precautionary measures to prevent the virus’s spread. The poll found that only 36 percent of respondents wanted businesses to require customers to prove that they’ve been vaccinated — down 15 percentage points from when the question was first asked in February. Part of these changing attitudes could be driven by the fact that Americans are increasingly likely to say that the worst of the pandemic is behind us: A separate <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/04/04/concerns-about-covid-19-pandemic-and-measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov</a> poll found that, as of late March, only 11 percent of survey respondents believed the pandemic would get worse, compared to 31 percent who felt the same at the start of January. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s still a lot we don’t know about this, but at this point Americans don’t seem to be worrying about it as much as they did the delta wave that rocked the nation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/health/delta-variant-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last summer</a> or last fall and winter’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omicron wave</a>. In mid-September, as cases rose nationwide, a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/views-on-the-pandemic/#section-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult tracking survey</a> found that one-third (33 percent) of adults saw COVID-19 as a “severe” health risk to their community. As of earlier this week, that number sat at just 15 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for preventative measures like vaccine requirements, especially in the workplace, has decreased, too. According to a March poll from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/31/americans-skeptical-about-religious-objections-to-covid-19-vaccines-but-oppose-employer-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, only 29 percent of U.S. adults said employers should require their employees to get a vaccine. A majority of respondents (44 percent) said vaccines should be encouraged instead. Last July and August though, per <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354983/majority-supports-biden-covid-vaccine-mandates.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a>, support for these measures was much higher, with 52 percent of U.S. adults saying they were in favor of employee vaccine requirements, versus 38 percent who said they were opposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some ways, the fact that fewer Americans are concerned about contracting COVID-19 shouldn’t be <em>too</em> surprising. As FiveThirtyEight’s Jean Yi <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-isnt-going-anywhere-and-americans-know-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted in February</a>, Americans seem to be increasingly accepting of the fact that COVID-19 <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/how-we-live-coronavirus-forever/619783/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be here for good</a>. And while there’s still a lot we don’t know about BA.2, it’s also possible that this subvariant just won’t be <a href="https://consumer.healthday.com/3-23-does-omicron-ba-2-signal-another-covid-surge-for-americans-2657003626.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as deadly</a> as previous waves, and therefore, Americans are simply thinking about the virus differently. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pandemic fatigue might be an additional factor. As the chart below illustrates, how Americans are thinking about COVID-19 hasn’t changed much from March to April according to the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index. In both months, 30 percent of respondents said they were in favor of getting back to “life as usual” with zero COVID-19 mandates or requirements in place. But that is pretty different from how respondents were looking at the virus just a few months earlier: At the start of February, less than a quarter of respondents (21 percent) said the same. American’s perceptions of mask mandates have also changed drastically since then. About two months ago, 21 percent of adults said in the same survey that we should <em>increase </em>mask mandates and vaccine precautions, versus a mere 6 percent who felt the same way in April.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Of course, despite polling that suggests Americans may be adopting more lax attitudes toward the pandemic, global health experts continue to warn that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/covid-19-pandemic-is-far-over-who-official-2022-03-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 is far from gone</a>. In fact, it’s possible that, in the coming weeks, the nation could see another surge in infections driven by BA.2. But whether that will change people’s attitudes toward COVID-19 precautions seems to remain an open question.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Americans are feeling the economic fallout of higher gas prices, and changing their behavior in response. Half of Americans reported that <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/April-2022-ABC-news-poll">the increased prices had caused some degree of financial hardship</a>, according to an April 8-9 poll from ABC News/Ipsos. A Morning Consult poll from March 17-20 found that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/13/gas-price-pain-curbing-mobility/">31 percent of adults purchased less gas</a> in March than they had in the previous month. When Morning Consult asked whether they had used other forms of transportation in a March 18-21 poll, 44 percent said they walked, 18 percent biked, 15 percent used public transport and 7 percent used an electric bike or scooter. That said, a plurality of Americans (47 percent) still told Morning Consult that they supported sanctioning Russian oil and natural gas exports, even if that led to higher prices, according to a poll conducted April 2-4.</li><li>The state of the economy is clearly top of mind for most Americans, as <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-inflation-outweighs-jobs-on-economic-views-prices-force-cutbacks/">76 percent said that the economy should be a high priority</a> for the country to address in an April 5-8 poll from CBS News/YouGov. Seventy-three percent said the same about inflation, which far outweighs concern for the other issues asked about. Other high-priority issues included crime (59 percent) and the “situation” between Russia and Ukraine (58 percent), but all the other issues asked about, immigration, climate change and COVID-19, polled below 50 percent. But Americans aren’t feeling all bad on the economic front. They had a brighter outlook on job availability — 56 percent said their local job market was good, and 51 percent said that the number of jobs in the U.S. overall increased over the last year.</li><li>According to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/04/12/opinions-laws-limiting-teaching-sexuality-gender">an April 5-8 YouGov poll</a>, American adults are divided on the provisions in Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law, which some critics have termed “Don’t Say Gay,” because it would limit discussions of gender and sexual orientation in kindergarden through third grade classrooms. Forty-four percent said they supported banning public school teachers from providing instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity to students in kindergarten through third grade, while 41 percent opposed it. Meanwhile, 47 percent said they supported allowing parents to sue school districts if they believed classroom instruction on these topics was not age-appropriate according to state standards, while 38 percent opposed it.</li><li>When it comes to social media companies and users under 18, many Americans think more protections should be in place, according to two April 13 polls from YouGov. Sixty percent of respondents felt that social media companies <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/04/13/2dfd8/3">shouldn’t be allowed</a> to make content recommendations to underage users, and 72 percent didn’t want those companies <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/04/13/2dfd8/2">collecting data on those users</a>. Forty-seven percent even said in a third poll that people under 18 <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/04/13/2dfd8/1">shouldn’t be able to</a> create their own social media accounts at all.</li><li>There’s currently widespread support for a number of climate change policy proposals that would limit greenhouse gas emissions, according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391679/climate-change-proposals-favored-solid-majorities.aspx">March 1-18 poll from Gallup</a>. Large majorities back all six of the proposals asked about — 61 percent favor providing tax credits for those who buy electric vehicles, 62 percent favor establishing stricter limits on methane emissions when producing natural gas, 71 percent favor higher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, 75 percent favor tax incentives for businesses that use renewable energy, and 89 percent favor providing tax credits for individuals who install at-home renewable energy systems like solar panels. Even the least popular proposal asked about, increasing federal funding for electric vehicle charging stations, had 59 percent of respondents in favor of it.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval </strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO — Nine months after the 2020 election, the call came in. The Colorado secretary of state’s office was on the phone and wanted to know why the passwords for Mesa County’s election equipment were on the internet for anyone to see. But the powers that be in Mesa County didn’t even know the passwords had leaked. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re saying, ‘What are you talking about?’” recalled Mesa County Commissioner Scott McInnis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Images of screens displaying the passwords had been shared a few days earlier on the chat app Telegram by a QAnon leader. The Colorado secretary of state launched an investigation and issued an order for Tina Peters, the county clerk, to let them inspect the equipment and try to get to the bottom of what happened. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there was a problem. Peters wasn’t in Mesa County. She was on her way to South Dakota for a “Cyber Symposium” hosted by Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow and one of the most prominent peddlers of the Big Lie. Data from Mesa County election equipment hard drives were later displayed at the symposium. The man talking about them was that same QAnon leader — Ron Watkins — the former administrator of the message board where Q, the shadowy figure behind the QAnon conspiracy movement, posted the bulk of their posts. Watkins is so deeply entangled with QAnon that many experts believe he may have been Q himself.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These days, Peters is back in Mesa County. She has to be. She can’t leave the state after being <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/03/09/mesa-clerk-tina-peters-charged-by-grand-jury-in-election-security-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently indicted</a> by a grand jury on 10 counts, including seven felony charges, for allegedly using a false identity and lying to state employees while allowing an unauthorized individual to make copies of the election equipment hard drive. When I visited last month, I found her at the Hilton DoubleTree in Grand Junction — the county seat — where she was attending the county GOP Assembly to campaign for her spot on the primary ballot. She’s now running for secretary of state. There, sitting on a patio with her bright white bob sparkling in the sun, she told me that her decision to copy the election equipment hard drives was not only allowed but required. And she believes those copies have revealed serious vulnerabilities in the county’s election equipment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If I want somebody to come in and preserve my election records, that is my role, and that is my duty,” Peters said. “That’s what I did.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the way she chose to go about “preserving” those records has wrought havoc on Mesa County and on Peters herself. Addressing the fallout of her actions, including having to replace election equipment deemed compromised by the state, has cost more than $1 million of tax-payer money, according to McInnis. Her actions also led to the indictment charges, for which she faces up to 28 years in jail and $2.7 million in fines, with the potential for more charges coming. And it has sown further mistrust in the election system among voters, all while failing to unearth any actual evidence of election fraud. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters’s story is wild. It begins with an after-hours backup of the hard drives straight out of a heist movie and also includes switched-off security cameras, the MyPillow guy and Peters <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/arrest-video-shows-mesa-county-elections-clerks-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donkey-kicking a cop in a bagel shop</a> (when I spoke with Peters, she got out of her seat to demonstrate how it was accidental). It’s a singular sequence of events. But it may also be a preview of what’s to come for other communities across the country. It’s a cautionary tale of what happens when those charged with overseeing our elections believe in the Big Lie.

In Texas alone, 43 Big Lie-endorsing candidates have run in the state’s congressional and gubernatorial races thus far. Election fraud believers are also running for less high-profile jobs that would give them influence over elections: secretary of state, attorney general and, yes, county clerk. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Getting such candidates elected to these positions is an explicitly stated goal of some of the biggest promoters of the Big Lie. Steve Bannon, the former Donald Trump strategist whose podcast played a key role in spreading the election fraud theory (and who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/trump-aide-steve-bannon-trial-set-for-jan-6-capitol-riot-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">himself was indicted</a> on charges of contempt of Congress for refusing to testify to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol), has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/steve-bannon-donald-trump-michael-flynn-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted these candidates on his podcast</a> and stressed the importance of voting for his anointed picks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re taking this back village by village,” Bannon said <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/bannons-war-room-1011321/episodes/episode-1003-run-toward-troubl-92687807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on an episode last summer</a>. “Where the energy is, is taking these school boards back. Where the energy is, is precinct committeemen, people signing up to throw out the GOP establishment.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters, for her part, wasn’t always a voter fraud conspiracist. When she was elected in 2018, there was little talk of elections. Her main platform point was a pledge to reopen two DMV offices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[The race] was solely focused on motor vehicles more than it was elections,” said Bobbie Gross, Peters’s opponent in the GOP primary that year and one of the candidates running to replace Peters as county clerk this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even directly following the 2020 election, Peters told me she trusted everything had gone smoothly. When people started coming to her with questions and allegations of fraud, she said she didn’t think there was anything to them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I said, ‘You know what? Bring me what you have, we’ll check it out,’” Peters said. “Now, in my mind, I’m thinking we’ll just debunk it and we’ll explain how that can’t be possible.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But something started to erode Peters’s prior belief that the county’s elections were secure. As early as January 2021, Peters <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/peters-tweets-conspiracy-theory-over-election-system/article_3a73d404-4ec5-11eb-9597-1b5e0fdc20da.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted election fraud conspiracies</a> from a personal account, claiming that it’s possible to “tabulate ballots more than once favoring a candidate” and to “change algorithm in a voting machine.” Then in April, when the most staunchly conservative candidates in the Grand Junction City Council race did not win, Peters was surprised. “When I pulled the tallies at 7 p.m. for the municipal election, I was shocked. I was shocked,” Peters said. “I went, ‘There’s no way.’” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, election surprises happen all the time. While Mesa County as a whole is comfortably red, Grand Junction itself has grown more moderate over the past few years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even leaning blue</a> in some neighborhoods. The candidates who won also largely had more experience with local government, and many sources with knowledge of Mesa County politics told me there was nothing surprising about the results of the race. </p>

But since then, she has become a vocal proponent for debunked election fraud conspiracies. <p>McKenzie Lange / The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel via AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Two weeks after the city council election, Peters <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/an-elections-supervisor-embraced-conspiracy-theories-officials-say-she-has-become-an-insider-threat/2021/09/26/ee60812e-1a17-11ec-a99a-5fea2b2da34b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requested her staff attend</a> a presentation by Douglas Frank, a high school math teacher from Ohio who was touring the country making claims of election fraud. It was around this time that the secretary of state’s office informed county clerks that they were planning to conduct what’s called a “trusted build,” a secure but routine in-person update of the software on all election equipment in the state that takes place in a lull between elections. The update requires the presence of employees from the secretary of state’s office, the local county clerk’s offices and Dominion — the manufacturer of the voting machines for most counties in Colorado, including Mesa County. As part of the preparations, every county was required to back up all election data prior to the update to make sure no important information was lost. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters was making her own preparations. On May 17, eight days before the update was to occur, Peters’s deputy clerk, Belinda Knisley, requested that the security cameras in the election offices be turned off. While legal,<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/rule_making/CurrentRules/8CCR1505-1/Rule20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;By law&lt;/a&gt;, the security cameras are only required to be on for 60 days prior to an election and 30 days following, and this time period did not fall into that window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a> multiple sources told me the cameras were not typically turned off.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters has been forthcoming about the fact that she made backups of the election equipment hard drive. She also confirmed that she had the security cameras turned off. But she’s less open to speaking about precisely how it all went down from there. When asked if anyone helped her make the backups, she told me: “I don’t want to really talk about that, because that’s under investigation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The indictment against Peters alleges that the Sunday before the update was to take place, three security badges were used while accessing secured election offices. One of those badges belonged to Peters, another to an elections manager <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/brown-fired-from-clerks-office/article_d9127c14-4271-11ec-920f-930f0c507553.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who would later be fired</a>, and the last to a man named Gerald Wood, who had only been hired as a temp worker the week before and who says he wasn’t there that day. Then, on the day of the update, employees of the secretary of state’s office and Dominion testified that Peters introduced a clerk’s office employee as Gerald Wood. But, again, Wood said he wasn’t there that day and provided an alibi to back it up. Peters has been charged with, among other things, identity theft and criminal impersonation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s almost like a miniature Watergate,” said McInnis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I emailed Peters a detailed list of follow-up questions about these specific allegations in the indictment, but she did not provide a response prior to publication. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP22006746316201-711.jpg" alt="Douglas Frank gives a presentation on election fraud" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP22006746316201-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP22006746316201-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP22006746316201-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Peters asked her staff to attend a presentation from Douglas Frank, a high school math teacher who has toured the country promoting false claims that the 2020 election was rigged. <p>David Carson / St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In August, Watkins — the QAnon guy — made the data from those hard drive copies available online, right after he leaked the photos and videos that included the Mesa County passwords. Watkins did not respond to questions sent to him via his lawyer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The leak prompted the secretary of state’s office to begin an investigation, which revealed the ballot tabulation machines had been compromised and needed to be decertified and replaced at the county’s expense. The secretary of state also <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2021/08/30/colorado-jena-griswold-tina-peters-mesa-county-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a petition</a> to have a judge strip Peters and Knisley of their authority to oversee the November 2021 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m happy to walk through what an election record is and what it isn’t. But lying to my office, allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment, leaking sensitive passwords that control the motherboard of the entire voting equipment and compromising voting equipment is not allowed,” said Jena Griswold, Colorado’s secretary of state, in an interview. “That creates a security risk.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters, meanwhile, maintains that it was perfectly legal for her to make copies of the hard drive and that her actions have helped reveal vulnerabilities in the election system. The hard drive copies were analyzed by two people with connections to Lindell, a software developer and a former cybersecurity strategist. They put together <a href="https://www.tinapetersforcolorado.com/election-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of reports</a> alleging the update had led to the deletion of important election records, and revealed security weaknesses in the ballot tabulation machines. The reports have been <a href="https://www.nbc11news.com/2021/09/25/elections-expert-sec-state-respond-allegations-election-system-data-destruction-insecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> by <a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/2021/11/example-forensicating-mesa-county.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experts</a> who say they fail to actually show what they allege. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What the reports <em>do</em> show is that there can be a security risk to the ballot tabulation machines, but only if someone has physical access to the machines — which are only accessible to authorized individuals who have undergone background checks and have access to the locked area where the machines are located, <em>and</em> who have access to the passwords — as Peters is alleged to have allowed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In general, it’s nearly impossible to make a modern Windows computer secure against somebody who has physical access to the machine,” Robert Graham, a cybersecurity expert who had reviewed Peters’s reports, said in an email.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the leak, the Mesa County district attorney began an investigation into the alleged security breach, as did federal investigators with the FBI, who <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/ag-to-tina-peters-no-your-door-was-not-batted-down/article_ba0196ec-47fe-11ec-af9f-8fae38ede34f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later raided the homes</a> of Peters, Wood and two other individuals. This January, <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/01/13/grand-jury-will-weigh-possible-charges-in-mesa-clerk-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a grand jury was tasked</a> with considering the findings of the DA’s investigation. Peters announced she was running for secretary of state the following month, but in March, the grand jury indicted Peters on 10 counts, including criminal impersonation, attempt to influence a public servant, and identity theft. If found guilty of all charges, Peters <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/peters-knisley-surrender-to-law-enforcement-after-indictments/article_98db6796-9fe6-11ec-a814-bfc1b13c4c21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be sentenced</a> to up to 28 years in jail and face $2.7 million in fines. She has no plans to suspend her secretary of state campaign. </p>

The only other person who garnered such widespread support was Rep. Lauren Boebert, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/boebert-capitol-guns/2021/01/04/a59f70f8-4e9d-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gun-toting, pro-Trump</a> freshman member whose district includes Mesa County. (Boebert declined to speak with me for this story but had previously <a href="https://boebert.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-lauren-boeberts-statement-fbi-investigation-mesa-county-clerk-tina-peters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a statement</a> supporting the district attorney’s investigation.) In the world of Big Lie believers and the far right, Peters has become one of a small cast of folk heroes. And while she’s the one facing criminal charges, the biggest names in the Big Lie circuit, such as Lindell and Bannon, are more than happy to use her story to further their own ambitions. Following the symposium, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyvjwa/mike-lindell-is-hiding-an-alleged-election-data-leaker-as-fbi-open-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peters went into hiding</a> for a month with Lindell’s help and did not <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/clerk-peters-returns-to-grand-junction-vows-to-fight/article_5f3bb9b2-1753-11ec-b5c1-1b6804deafa0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return to Mesa County</a> until mid-September. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the county commissioners have done their best to clean up the mess on their hands. To try to restore trust in the election process ahead of an election last fall, the commissioners implemented additional verification measures: They hired Clear Ballot, another certified election equipment vendor and Dominion’s chief competitor, to re-count all the ballots that were run through the Dominion machines. And then they did a hand count. Neither count showed major discrepancies — the Dominion counts were accurate. The commissioners are also in the process of anonymizing all ballots in order to upload them online so that voters can verify the vote totals themselves. They’re even planning to refurbish the room where election equipment is stored to have bigger windows and allow election-watchers a better view of the counting process, according to McInnis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This thing has cost this little county at least $1 million. It’s going to be $1 million-plus, and we haven’t turned up one fraudulent vote. Not one,” McInnis said. The bulk of the cost came from replacing the equipment, implementing the additional safeguards, personnel, and diverting resources from other departments, according to McInnis. For context, that represents roughly a third of the county clerk’s office’s <a href="https://www.mesacounty.us/globalassets/finance/budgets/2022/2022-adopted-budget/adopted-budget.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire annual budget</a> for 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet none of those efforts have swayed Peters or her followers, who are still suspicious of the election equipment in Mesa County, despite the fact that Trump won the county in 2020 by 28 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“To my chagrin, it has not appeased hardly anybody,” said Cody Davis, another county commissioner.</p>

Two individuals who refused to give me their names told me Peters is a “hero.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“My gut tells me, ‘Why would anybody in their right mind put themselves through what she’s put herself through just to put herself through it?’” said Melissa Anchondo, who was attending the assembly. “I think she’s innocent. I think she’s great. I hope people can start to realize what’s going on.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There’s an awful lot of questions, and I think if you ask most of the people here I’ll bet most would say they don’t believe the election was fair,” said David Dearborn, a delegate at the assembly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the delegates who refused to give me her name said, “She is a hero and she’ll go down in Colorado history as being a hero for all the voters against the corruption of Dominion voting machines.”</p>

In the course of our one-hour conversation, most of which was focused on Peters, McCarney managed to get in comments about his belief in the Second Amendment, his anti-abortion views, and make a dig at soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. As chair of the GOP in Mesa County, a county that hasn’t elected a Democrat since 1964, McCarney said he has sometimes been accused of being “too conservative.” But even he has been frustrated by what Peters did. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don’t like being a babysitter, and that’s what I’ve been the last six months because of the Tina situation,” McCarney said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are a lot of Republicans in Mesa County — this is, after all, the region of the country that elected Boebert, one of the most conservative and bombastic members of Congress. Nearly every elected official I spoke to for this story, including the county commissioners, the candidate running to replace Peters as clerk, and the county treasurer (who was tasked with helping run last year’s election after Peters was stripped of her duties) was a Republican. All of these stalwart supporters of the GOP have been forced to reckon with the outcome of her actions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a place like this, the Republican primary for many positions is essentially the general election. That was the case in 2018, when Peters, then a local businesswoman, <a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/tina-peters-wins-clerks-spot-defeats-office-veteran/article_bf9bc82c-79c9-11e8-9cb6-10604b9f6eda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beat out Gross</a>, a 10-year veteran of the clerk’s office, to win the GOP nomination for county clerk, securing the job. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Her first year in office was relatively uncontroversial, but in 2020, after 574 uncounted ballots were discovered in a drop box for an election the previous fall, a recall effort against Peters was launched. The recall effort — backed by several former employees of the clerk’s office, which had seen three-quarters of its staff resign under Peters — failed to get enough signatures to prompt a vote, but the Colorado secretary of state did order an election observer to report on the clerk’s office. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of Peters’s GOP colleagues forgave her for that incident, telling me “mistakes happen.” But they weren’t as forgiving of the alleged decision to allow an unauthorized person to essentially hack the voting system. McCarney said it has caused tension among Republicans, between those who support Peters and believe there was fraud and those who don’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We have a division where we shouldn’t have division right now,” McCarney said. “I don’t care if you hate one another, we’re Republicans and we need to band together in this election. There are people here who have drunk the Kool-Aid, as I say, and their hatred is palpable toward anybody who disagrees with them.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP21336123166790-711.jpg" alt="The crowd at a rally in support of Tina Peters" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP21336123166790-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP21336123166790-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP21336123166790-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Many conservatives see Peters as a public official trying to expose election misconduct — misconduct for which there is no evidence. <p>McKenzie Lange / The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel via AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s also forced Republican representatives to bear heavy critiques from their own team. Davis, the Mesa County commissioner, told me his voicemail was full of messages from angry voters. He suspects that most of them, the most threatening ones, come from people out of state, as they came in after his contact information was shared publicly by Lindell and because the individuals who have come out to voice their frustration in person have largely been polite. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This is what I signed up for,” Davis said. “I enjoy engaging with people. When I can get people to a room or a coffee table, I can actually have a good rational conversation with people. It’s the people who won’t return my phone calls, who don’t want to listen to me, who just email me. They’re interested in a narrative, not in the truth.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Mesa County is not made up exclusively of Big Lie believers, and elected officials have received plenty of criticism from constituents who think the efforts taken to appease those who believe there was voter fraud are a waste of time and money. McInnis showed me an anonymous letter calling him “a disgrace and an embarrassment” for not removing Peters from office. (As an elected official, Peters cannot be removed from office by the county commissioners.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The turmoil Peters’s actions have caused for her fellow partisans demonstrates why Republicans, too, ought to be wary of the potential for a wave of election truthers being elected to office this fall. While it may initially appease the base, having an elected official who believes in the Big Lie can easily go south, helping those who stand to profit from the ongoing erosion of electoral trust. Having someone “on the inside” provides profiteers like Bannon an opportunity for access and a source for red meat to throw to their audience. For everyone else, including Republicans, it’s a disaster.</p>

One of the bigger ones is who exactly helped her make the copy of the hard drive. If the man using the identity of Gerald Wood was in fact not Wood, who was he? There are <a href="https://twitter.com/get_innocuous/status/1425901516225859588" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some theories that have been floated</a>, but as of right now we can’t say conclusively. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another pressing question is what will happen to Peters herself. For now, she’s awaiting trial for the charges laid against her and may face more charges out of the federal investigation. She’s currently facing another court challenge from the secretary of state to remove her from overseeing another election — this time the 2022 midterms. She was given a contempt of court citation for allegedly recording a hearing in a case against her deputy clerk. And when police tracked her down in a local bagel shop to execute a search warrant for that iPad, she allegedly resisted, leading to her being placed in handcuffs and donkey-kicking a cop — so she also faces charges for obstruction of a peace officer. And then there are the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/11/16/tina-peters-mesa-county-elections-ethics-complaint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple ethics complaints</a> filed against her for raising money to cover legal fees and accepting gifts in the form of travel and housing from Lindell. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peters is still running for secretary of state. And last weekend, she attended the state Republican Assembly, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-michael-bennet-colorado-colorado-springs-donald-trump-05ea9af16f9e8cb7e70761f4f02ddb3a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receiving 61 percent of the votes</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Big Lie proponents are currently running for secretary of state, governor and Congress. They’re running for school boards, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/heeding-steve-bannons-call-election-deniers-organize-to-seize-control-of-the-gop-and-reshape-americas-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election boards</a> and county clerks. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/us/politics/2020-election-voting-officials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veteran election officials</a> have been resigning in droves thanks to the death threats and intimidation lobbed at them by those who believe they were complicit in a stolen election. Peters’s story is unique, but it might not be for long. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Americans aren’t happy with the economy and it’s perhaps no wonder why when you look at the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest inflation numbers</a> out this week. Prices have risen 8.5 percent since last March, and wages haven’t kept pace, rising 6 percent in the past year. Economists are debating whether there are silver linings in March’s inflation numbers, but regardless 8.5 percent inflation is the highest rate in four decades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans have taken note. According to Gallup, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391220/inflation-dominates-americans-economic-concerns-march.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 percent</a> of Americans say the high cost of living is the most important issue facing the country – the most since 1985. In the University of Michigan <a href="https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/fetchdoc.php?docid=69606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Survey of Consumers</a>, more households reported they expected worsening finances over the coming year than at any point in the history of the survey, which began in the 1940s. And only <a href="https://www.pollingreport.com/biden_adm.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30-35 percent</a> of Americans approve of President Biden’s handling of the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, Galen Druke speaks with George Washington University economist <a href="https://economics.columbian.gwu.edu/tara-m-sinclair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara Sinclair</a> about the Americans’ pessimistic assessment of the economy.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When people talk about <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes in work and office culture</a> brought on by the pandemic — whether it’s returning to the office, working from home or a combination of remote and in-person work — they often overlook one very important group: people who were never able to work from home in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are many reasons why some people continued to report to in-person jobs throughout the pandemic, and we’re interested in talking to people — particularly women — who were unable to work from home for at least some or all of the pandemic. We’d like to speak to you if you had or have the kind of job that requires in-person interactions, like in food service, retail or health care, or if you had or have the kind of job that may have been possible to do remotely but for whatever reason you were unable to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’d like to know how you handled it, how it affected your work and home life, why you weren’t able to work from home and how it’s changed your relationship with work going forward. We’d also like to know whether being unable to work from home made a difference in your decision to continue working, leave the workforce or search for a new job. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Grooming” has become the most recent scare tactic of choice for the right. Fox News host Laura Ingraham <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/laura-ingraham/fox-news-chyron-liberals-are-sexually-grooming-elementary-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included a segment on her show last month</a> where she claimed public schools have become “grooming centers” where “sexual brainwashing” takes place. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1511830318365515778" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently tweeted</a> that the Democrats are the party of “grooming and transitioning children.” Last week, One America News host Chanel Rion <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/one-america-news-network/oan-host-biden-groomer-chief" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even called President Joe Biden</a> “the groomer-in-chief.” </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What kind of people would oppose grooming laws</p>— Jack Posobiec <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2626.png" alt="☦"> (@JackPosobiec) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1511800494196342785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2022</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">For the unfamiliar, “grooming” is a term typically reserved to describe the type of behavior that child sexual abusers use to <a href="https://www.rainn.org/news/grooming-know-warning-signs#:~:text=One%20tool%20common%20to%20those,the%20risk%20of%20being%20caught." target="_blank" rel="noopener">coerce potential victims without being caught</a>. But now some Republicans are using it against any Democrat (<a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/walt-disney-groomer-children-lgbt-florida-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or company</a>)<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives have suggested that Disney’s opposition to Florida’s law restricting when kids learn about sexual orientation shows that the company supports groomers. FiveThirtyEight is owned by Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> who disagrees with them on certain policy issues. This is a deliberate tactic that was <a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1432808372324089856?s=20&amp;t=5H3o2PGieazxd8PfMBdCYg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted as early as last summer</a> by Christopher Rufo, the same conservative activist who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/06/19/critical-race-theory-rufo-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped muddle the language</a> around critical race theory. “Grooming” is a term that neatly draws together both modern conspiracy theories and old homophobic stereotypes, while comfortably shielding itself under the guise of protecting children. Who, after all, can argue against the safety of kids? But by adopting this language to bolster their latest political pursuits, the right is both giving a nod to fringe conspiracy theorists and using an age-old tactic to dismantle LGBTQ rights. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There is no better moral panic than a moral panic centered on potential harm to children,” said Emily Johnson, a history professor at Ball State University who specializes in U.S. histories of gender and sexuality. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This most recent round of high-profile “grooming” warnings seems to have started in early March, as Democrats attacked Florida’s law limiting what can be taught in schools. Republican defenders turned to “grooming” as a way to push back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The bill that liberals inaccurately call ‘Don’t Say Gay’ would be more accurately described as an Anti-Grooming Bill,” Christina Pushaw, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s press secretary, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1499886619259777029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted on March 4</a>. “If you’re against the Anti-Grooming Bill, you are probably a groomer or at least you don’t denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Except there’s no mention of grooming in the law. Instead, <a href="http://laws.flrules.org/2022/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it prohibits</a> “classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity” in kindergarten through third grade, “or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So if casting those who oppose this law as “pro-grooming” is not rooted in evidence, what is it rooted in? In part, it’s a dog whistle to the party’s most extreme, conspiracy-minded base. The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/qanons-obsession-with-savethechildren-is-making-it-harder-to-save-kids-from-traffickers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foundation</a> of the QAnon conspiracy theory is that there is a mass, secret, underground ring of Satanic pedophiles whose members consist of Democratic leaders and Hollywood elites. Painting anyone who opposes Florida’s law (i.e., mainly Democrats) as being pro-grooming fits neatly into that narrative and winks at QAnon adherents without requiring politicians on the right to actually endorse the outlandish theory. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this rhetoric also harkens back to age-old attacks on the LGBTQ community. Casting LGBTQ people as child predators and their very existence as something inherently sexual was a tactic used by anti-LGBTQ activists since the 1970s in their efforts to stifle or roll back LGBTQ legal protections, according to Marie-Amélie George, a law professor at Wake Forest University who specializes in LGBTQ rights. George said that for a long time, many people believed that being gay was the result of child sexual abuse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The religious right really modernized and repackaged that claim in the late ’70s and early ’80s to be that ‘gays and lesbians cannot reproduce, so they have to recruit,’” George said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s not the ’80s anymore. Over the past few decades, Americans’ understanding and acceptance of the LGBTQ community has increased. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/258065/gallup-first-polled-gay-issues-changed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of Gallup polls</a> captures this evolution: In 1977, just 13 percent of Americans believed that “[b]eing gay or lesbian is something a person is born with,” but by 2019, 49 percent of Americans did. As this social shift happened and the LGBTQ community achieved more rights, it made the “child predator” narrative less effective. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why, then, is it back? George suspects the reason we’re seeing it come up again is due to the most recent frontier of LGBTQ rights: trans rights. “The reason it’s gaining more resonance now is, in part, because people understand trans identity much less clearly,” George said. “There’s a misunderstanding that people are electing a different gender identity as opposed to coming to realize what their gender identity is.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">George said anti-LGBTQ activists are capitalizing on this misunderstanding to advance their agenda. George identified this trend in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3028221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her 2017 paper she published</a> in the Wisconsin Law Review. She noted that from 1999 until 2012, voters regularly supported LGBTQ protections in local ballot measures. But around 2012, anti-LGBTQ activists began highlighting the gender-identity protections in these laws, and the ballot measures began failing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pushaw, for her part, denies that any of this rhetoric is homophobic. She <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5q9vx/child-grooming-lgbtq-smear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Vice News</a> she “never once singled out LGBTQ people” and that the “assumption that criticism of grooming is criticism of the LGBTQ community equates LGBTQ people to groomers, which is both bigoted and inaccurate. Do better. And, any adult who wants to discuss sexual and gender identity topics with other people’s 5- to 8-year-old children—while keeping this a secret from their parents—is either a groomer or is complicit in promoting an environment where grooming becomes normalized.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what’s being normalized here isn’t grooming; it’s the use of homophobic rhetoric and conspiracy theory language. And it’s intended not to protect children but to advance political causes and slander political enemies.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The things Desireé Luckey remembers most about finding out she was pregnant for the first time are how fast the little test strip turned positive — and how irritated it made her feel. It was one more hassle in a summer that already felt overwhelming. Within the span of a few weeks in 2012, Luckey had graduated college, ended an emotionally unsafe relationship and started a new — but frustratingly unpaid — job with former President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign. From her dorm bathroom, she immediately began figuring out what she’d need to do to get an abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kelsea McLain also knew she wanted an abortion as soon as she found out she was pregnant. Graduating college during the Great Recession, she was surviving on unemployment and about to lose her apartment. Both women wanted private, inexpensive abortions. Because of that, they chose medication abortion — two pills that, when taken together, <a href="https://nwhn.org/abortion-pills-vs-miscarriage-demystifying-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectively mimic the biology of an early miscarriage</a>. Medication abortion allowed Luckey and McLain to abort their pregnancies at home. It was logistically simpler than going to a clinic for a procedure. It was cheaper. And it was <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-availability-and-use-of-medication-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just as safe</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it can also be terribly painful. McLain suffered through intense cramping, nausea and weeks of heavy vaginal bleeding. Not everyone’s medication abortion is like that — Luckey’s was straightforward and less uncomfortable than periods she’d had, and she was back walking the full parade route at Capital Pride in Washington, D.C., the next day. No one knows ahead of time whether their experience will be more like Luckey’s or more like McLain’s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In just a few months, many more Americans may be rolling that dice. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/mississippi-abortion-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Supreme Court is weighing</a> the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with an opinion expected by June. The court’s conservative majority is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/01/21/1074605184/abortion-roe-v-wade-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to make it easier for states to at least restrict abortion access, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-supreme-court-looks-ready-to-overturn-roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s possible</a> that it could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion, which would allow states to ban abortion outright. If that happens, a lot more people will be obtaining abortion pills illegally.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22968993/abortion-pills-mail-medication-fda-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medication can be an effective tool</a> for people trying to evade abortion restrictions, and it’s much safer than other illegal abortion methods. But as abortion access is further restricted, increased reliance on pills could also make more people struggle through an intensely painful — even traumatic — experience, with little access to medical support, lots of stigma and more legal risk than ever before. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">For almost three decades after abortion became legal, Americans who wanted to end their pregnancies had one option: an in-clinic procedure. That changed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/us/us-approves-abortion-pill-drug-offers-more-privacy-and-could-reshape-debate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the fall of 2000</a>, when the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone, an abortion-inducing drug that allows people to go through the physical process of an abortion at home. To end a pregnancy, people first take mifepristone, which stops the pregnancy from growing. Then the second drug, misoprostol, which is usually taken 24 to 48 hours later, tells the uterus to expel the pregnancy. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to current FDA regulations</a>, the combination can be used until the 10th week of pregnancy.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone who gets an abortion identifies as a woman. We have tried to use gender-neutral language in this story when referring to those who receive abortions, except where we are citing the specific experiences of people who identify as women, studies that identified their participants as women or historical context about how the medical community has treated women as a social class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The introduction of the pill sequence transformed abortion in the U.S. At first, it wasn’t an especially popular choice, largely because the FDA imposed <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2013/03/medication-abortion-restrictions-burden-women-and-providers-and-threaten-us-trend-toward" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots of restrictions</a> on the medication. But that changed in recent years, in part because of the pandemic. By 2020, the Guttmacher Institute estimated that more than half of abortions in the U.S. were medication abortions. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Medication abortions have gotten a lot more popular" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/60Fzz/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As access to in-person abortion dwindles, medication abortion is more available than it’s ever been. For a long time, the FDA’s regulations said that medication abortion needed to be provided in-person, in a medical setting, but after the rules changed — <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-court-blocks-fda-restriction-unnecessarily-imposes-covid-19-risks-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily</a> at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/15/1064598531/the-fda-could-permanently-lift-some-restrictions-on-abortion-pills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then permanently a few months ago</a> — a crop of <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/medication-abortion-telemedicine-innovations-and-barriers-during-the-covid-19-emergency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion-focused telehealth companies</a> sprang up with the goal of making the process as seamless as possible. As a result, it’s now possible to get an abortion in <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/medication-abortion-telemedicine-innovations-and-barriers-during-the-covid-19-emergency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 20 states</a> without ever setting foot in a clinic. That also means it’s cheaper. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Anti-abortion lawmakers have realized this and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/abortion-pills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are trying to crack down</a> on the mail distribution of abortion pills in several states. A Supreme Court decision to allow states to ban first-trimester abortion would likely increase those attempts to control supply, since it’s a big loophole: Even if abortion is illegal, someone could order abortion pills from a telehealth company in a state where it’s legal and mail them to a person in a state where it’s not, or order pills from an online pharmacy. Access to abortion pills could undermine the coming wave of abortion bans, and everyone knows it.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">As medication abortion gets drawn into the political fight over abortion rights, the physical comfort of people seeking those abortions often gets overlooked. The side effects of medication abortion aren’t widely discussed, and it’s easy to understand why. There is <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots of misinformation about abortion pills</a> online, and anti-abortion advocates often <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/health-medicine/science-behind-abortion-pill-180963762/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatly overemphasize</a> side effects like pain, nausea or bleeding in an effort to make the procedure seem dangerous, which it’s not. In a country where abortion is such an intensely polarized issue, it’s hard to hold two ideas in place at the same time — that medication abortion is very safe, and also sometimes unpleasant to go through.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McLain decided to start her abortion while she was moving out of her apartment. As she carried boxes up and down the stairs, her uterus contracted over and over again, working to expel the pregnancy. She started to bleed — a lot. She threw up. After a while, she began to pass big, heavy blood clots. The pain was unbearable. “There were times that my pain was 10 out of 10,” she said. “I felt like I was going to pass out.” And it didn’t stop after a few hours. It just kept going. “I remember thinking everything was over, and then all of a sudden, bleeding heavily again,” she said. “It was like two weeks where I didn’t trust that my body was actually done.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She didn’t regret the abortion. In fact, McLain was intensely relieved that the pregnancy was over. But she felt traumatized by the pain, the isolation and the unshakeable feeling that the pain was her punishment for getting pregnant in the first place. The difficulty of the experience felt like something she had to stoically deal with, though in retrospect she thinks her feelings of anxiety and shame actually made the pain worse. “That whole experience, how alone I felt when I didn't need to feel alone, it really just left this lasting impact on me about the injustice of it all,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But McLain’s experience is not a rare one. Although <a href="https://www.ipas.org/clinical-update/english/pain-management/pain-management-for-medical-abortion-before-13-weeks-gestation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most clinical trials of medication abortion</a> don’t track it, the few studies that do suggest pain is common. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16781260/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2006 systematic review</a>, for example, found that 75 percent of women in five large studies from the U.S. and United Kingdom experienced pain severe enough to be treated with narcotics. In other studies, women consistently reported high levels of pain — with averages <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13625187.2017.1315092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranging from 5.6</a> on a 10-point pain scale to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21237336/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.4 on an 11-point pain scale</a>. “There are people who are still experiencing severe pain, and we need to do additional studies to find ways to help people manage their severe pain at home,” said <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/alyssa-colwill-md-mcr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Alyssa Colwill</a>, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health &amp; Science University who studies pain relief for medication abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And although most people who have gotten medication abortions <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X22000175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say they are satisfied</a> with them — <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00017-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as high as 98.4 percent who reported their experience in one</a> study — that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17303494/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may not tell us much</a> about how they felt. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/20/3/834/2356484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When one survey compared medication abortion with the alternative</a> — an outpatient, physical procedure sometimes erroneously called a "surgical abortion" — more people seemed satisfied with the in-clinic option. Colwill said that to her, the high satisfaction numbers for medication abortion are just women “telling us they’re happy they’re no longer pregnant.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is part of a larger problem that goes far beyond abortion. In general, gynecological pain isn't well studied or well treated. “Pain, generally in medicine but particularly in obstetrics and gynecology, has been minimized and overlooked, and that's related to misogyny,” said <a href="https://obgyn.ucsf.edu/san-francisco-general-hospital/daniel-grossman-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Daniel Grossman</a>, director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health program at the University of California, San Francisco. “There was kind of an assumption that women could tolerate the pain.” This is a pattern that’s <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=383803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-documented</a> in medicine — women’s pain tends to be undertreated for all kinds of conditions, from <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/PainNews/women-chronic-pain/story?id=15598143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronic illnesses</a> like fibromyalgia to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/is-bias-keeping-female-minority-patients-from-getting-proper-care-for-their-pain/2019/07/26/9d1b3a78-a810-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more acute issues</a> like broken bones. Other forms of reproductive care, like IUD insertions, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iud-insertion-pain_l_5c7fe889e4b0e62f69e8b919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also notoriously painful for some</a>, with many women reporting that their experiences were just shrugged off. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the challenge is that it’s hard to predict what any one person will experience. Doctors might not want to offer heavy hitting pain medications right away, since it’s possible that the experience will be like Luckey’s — uncomfortable, but not a big deal. But for people who have a lot of pain, the options for relief are not great. McLain, who had her abortion before the opioid crisis <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2737896" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made doctors leery</a> of prescribing narcotics, could take the painkiller hydrocodone if things got bad. In the U.K., where the vast majority of abortions <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/home-use-of-both-pills-for-early-medical-abortion/home-use-of-both-pills-for-early-medical-abortion-up-to-10-weeks-gestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are medication abortions</a>, patients who choose to do their abortion at home receive another painkiller, dihydrocodeine, as part of their take-home package. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the U.S., however, most abortion patients now get <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2020/10/medication-abortion-up-to-70-days-of-gestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a strong dose of ibuprofen</a> — a choice consistent with <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240039483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization guidelines</a>. In the studies those guidelines are based on, ibuprofen was the only treatment to consistently produce evidence of reducing pain during a medical abortion, said <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Reynolds-Wright" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Reynolds-Wright</a>, a clinical research fellow at the University of Edinburgh who is currently working to synthesize the evidence on pain management for medication abortion. But that's not the same thing as ibuprofen working<em> well</em>, he told us. And those studies looked at 800- or even 1,600-milligram doses of ibuprofen, much higher than the 400-milligram dose people are used to taking at home. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pain, as Colwill pointed out, doesn’t necessarily indicate something is unsafe, even though everyone wants to avoid it. But if abortion is banned, people could be taking abortion pills without much medical guidance, and the consequences could be more dire. Several states, including Oklahoma and South Carolina, <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wirf-abortion-bans/criminalization-of-self-managed-abortion-in-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already have laws on the books</a> that can be used to prosecute people who self-manage abortion. <a href="https://law.fsu.edu/faculty-staff/mary-ziegler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ziegler</a>, a professor at Florida State University College of Law who studies abortion law, said that because states will find it hard to enforce abortion bans as long as pills can be mailed in discreet packages, more anti-abortion state lawmakers might consider making it a crime to use abortion pills or help someone obtain them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If that happens, people could end up being prosecuted if they use abortion medications in a state where it's illegal, particularly if they end up going to the hospital. Physically, there's no way for medical professionals to be able to tell the difference between a pregnancy loss induced by abortion drugs and one that happened as part of a miscarriage, Grossman said. And the only way the difference would matter medically is if the patient had induced their abortion with some other substance like an herb concoction, rather than tested, FDA-approved meds.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that's not information people will necessarily know. In 2018, one group of researchers ordered abortion pills from 16 different websites and found that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782417304754#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none of them came with instructions</a>. Some people may make the mistake of telling medical staff about taking abortion meds — and then find themselves in legal trouble. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2015/09/prosecuting-women-self-inducing-abortion-counterproductive-and-lacking-compassion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s rare</a> for people to be prosecuted for self-managed abortion, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/magazine/purvi-patel-could-be-just-the-beginning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it has happened</a>. “Unfortunately, a lot of the ways that people have been criminalized is through the providers they turn to for help,” said Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel at <a href="https://www.ifwhenhow.org/about/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If/When/How</a>, a legal advocacy group that focuses on reproductive justice issues. That happened in 2012 when a woman in Pennsylvania helped her daughter obtain abortion pills online. The daughter later went to the hospital because the pain was so frightening and unexpected. The mother told hospital personnel about the pills, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/magazine/a-mother-in-jail-for-helping-her-daughter-have-an-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they reported her</a> to child protective services, and she ended up in jail.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even if it doesn’t end with prosecution, self-managing an abortion can be a scary and isolating experience. That’s a harm that women will have to absorb, too. And even though it has expanded access significantly, medication abortion won’t preserve abortion access if restrictions continue to mount. For one thing, there are limits to how much telehealth abortion companies can help people in states where abortion is illegal. Leah Coplon, the medical director at <a href="https://abortionondemand.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abortion on Demand</a>, a telehealth abortion company, said that although it’s very helpful, remote access to medication abortion can’t replace brick-and-mortar clinics. “I hesitate to have telehealth medication abortion seem like a panacea,” she said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And perhaps most fundamentally, as abortion becomes more restricted, people are losing the ability to decide for themselves what the experience will be like. Luckey and McLain both went on to have other abortions, and their decisions weren’t what you’d necessarily expect. Despite having a good experience with medication abortion, Luckey opted for an in-clinic abortion later, wanting the procedure to be over and done with quickly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McLain, meanwhile, had two more medication abortions — both of which were less traumatic than the first. By the time she needed another abortion, she was working in reproductive health and felt much less stressed about the whole process. For her, the feeling of being in control and lack of stress changed everything. “It was no big deal,” she said. “I remember the abortion being so completely pain-free and uneventful, I was worried it didn't work.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been nearly 14 years since Sarah Palin became one of the best-known and most polarizing politicians in the country as Sen. John McCain’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election. Since then, Palin has teased a comeback several times, but her campaign to run in this year’s special House election in Alaska is her <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-alaskas-special-election-create-an-opening-for-sarah-palins-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first attempt</a> to return to electoral politics. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew explains why Palin may not be a shoo-in for the seat left behind when Rep. Don Young died in March.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also debate whether the AARP is correct that <a href="https://press.aarp.org/2022-4-6-Women-Voters-Age-50-Over-Will-Decide-Balance-Power-Next-Election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women age 50 and over</a> will determine the outcome of the 2022 midterms. Finally, they discuss the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-in-blue-cities-are-increasingly-outliers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiences</a> of urban Republicans and rural Democrats in a country increasingly sorted geographically and politically.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Jonathan M. remembers seeing the signs clearly: One for the Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-backed <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/01/greg-casar-democratic-primary-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Casar</a> and another, near it, for Rep. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/17/lloyd-doggett-austin-congress-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lloyd Doggett</a>, a member of the <a href="https://progressives.house.gov/caucus-members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Progressive Caucus</a> who was running for a neighboring district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yard placards for both progressive Democratic politicians, he said, were littered throughout his neighborhood in Austin, Texas in the lead-up to the state’s primary elections in March. On the one hand, this shouldn’t be surprising: Austin — likened to a “blueberry in a bowl of tomato soup” <a href="https://twitter.com/markzbarabak/status/1178115321590353921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least once</a> by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry — is <a href="https://austin.culturemap.com/news/city-life/09-12-16-best-american-cities-liberals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known for its deep blue</a> hue. But as a Republican, Jonathan M., who preferred to only use his first name and last initial out of privacy concerns, didn’t plan to vote for either candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the self-described “classical conservative” told me that he voted in the Republican primary in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/texas-election-biden-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last month’s elections</a>. But voters like Jonathan M. are somewhat of a rare breed in Austin. According to countywide voting records, only <a href="https://countyclerk.traviscountytx.gov/wp-content/uploads/election_results_2022.03.01/RepublicanParty.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 6 percent</a> of registered voters in Travis County, <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/resident/about-city-austin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where Austin primarily sits</a>, voted in the state’s Republican primary, <a href="https://countyclerk.traviscountytx.gov/wp-content/uploads/election_results_2022.03.01/DemocraticParty.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared to almost 13 percent</a> who cast a ballot in the Democratic one. (<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/14/texas-primary-voting-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turnout was low</a>, however, like in most primaries.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just raw voting numbers that have helped Jonathan M. feel like an outlier: He said it took a drive down a major highway or perusal online to find even a <em>handful</em> of ads for Republican candidates. And even then, only marquee races, like the one for governor, were heavily advertised. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This primary cycle, I didn’t see any Republican signs in my area, but in 2020 I saw a lot of signs for Rep. Chip Roy,” he said, referencing the Austin-area Republican who <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/12/06/chip-roy-former-cruz-chief-staff-running-lamar-smiths-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once worked for</a> Sen. Ted Cruz and has since become a conservative firebrand in the U.S. House. “For big races, I feel like there’s a lot more campaigning by Republicans here, but there’s almost nothing happening for local races and, as a result, I feel like a lot of Democrats run unopposed.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of this is to be expected given just how much the U.S. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550621994000#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sorts itself</a> along geographic lines, with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-3-political-polarization-and-personal-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats preferring to live in</a> cities versus Republicans, who increasingly opt to call smaller towns or rural areas home. But this ideological sorting has still created a situation where many Republicans who live in the suburbs and bluer cities feel like outliers in their communities — much like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-it-like-being-a-democrat-in-trump-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats living in Trump country</a>. Some of the voters we spoke with would tease their ideological preferences (through having a GOP candidate’s bumper sticker on their car, for instance), but most have kept their political opinions to themselves. Several expressed having trouble finding friends with similar values who live close to them, and many felt like their party had largely given up on campaigning in their area of town. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there was one bright spot that helped many of the five Republicans and independent voters who have previously supported Republican candidates I spoke with feel more upbeat: the upcoming midterm elections. Expecting their party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to likely flip the U.S. House</a>, and maybe pick up a few seats in the U.S. Senate, was a way for them to reconcile their political identity even if representation wasn’t going to change where they lived. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I am more excited about the national results than the local races,” Charlie C., a 28-year-old self-proclaimed “staunch conservative” from St. Anthony, Minnesota, who only wanted to be identified by his first name and last initial, told me. “I am hoping that this year’s results are reminiscent of the Tea Party red wave from 2014.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been some time, though, since Republicans like Charlie C. likely felt this way as counties including the one he currently lives in have steadily gotten bluer. In fact, that’s been the case with practically <em>all</em> “urban-suburban” counties in the U.S.: From 2000 to 2020, “urban-suburban” counties have moved nearly 17 points toward Democrats, among them are Hennepin County and Ramsey County (where St. Anthony resides), according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of county-level election data since 2000 categorized using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Urbanization Index</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not all suburban counties have swung so dramatically toward Democrats. For instance, “mostly suburban” counties have moved from about 50-50 in 2000 to just a 10-point Democratic edge in 2020. But suburban and urban areas have, on average, moved toward Democrats. What’s more, they comprise a large share of the nation’s voting power: In 2020, “urban-suburban” or “mostly suburban” counties made up almost 52 percent of the total vote.<strong> </strong></p>

Ted] Cruz is far enough to the right in a district that elected [Rep.] Ilhan Omar.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the issue for voters like Charlie C. is that Democrats have expanded their foothold in the suburban areas of the U.S. — particularly during former President Donald Trump’s tenure. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a>, suburbanites backed Trump narrowly over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 2 points in 2016. But in 2018, Democrats took back control of the House thanks, in part, to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant inroads</a> they made in America’s suburbs and, by 2020, President Biden won suburban voters over Trump by 11 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nijman-American-Suburbs-Global-Suburbanisms/dp/1487520778" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jan Nijman</a>, the director of the Urban Studies Institute at Georgia State University, told me part of the swing toward Democrats can be attributed to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-07/the-changing-demographics-of-america-s-suburbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changing demographics</a> of the suburbs, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including an increase</a> in the number of college-educated and nonwhite voters living there. “We’ve seen most of our population growth in the U.S. in areas we’d think of as ‘suburban.’ And just that simple fact means there’s now more diversity in those places,” Nijman said. Another consequence of the suburbs becoming more economically and racially diverse, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/18/opinion/suburbs-poor-diverse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly in the last two decades</a>, “is that [they’ve] become the most dynamic places in the electoral landscape,” Nijman said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It wasn’t always like this, though. In fact, suburbs were once the desired destination for those looking to <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/white-flight-2-36805862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flee more diverse, urban areas</a> — especially for more conservative white voters. In the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republicans-lost-suburbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1950s and ’60s</a>, Nijman told me, “suburbia was understood as a place that was quite homogeneous and predictable, meaning that the people attracted to suburbs at the time were solidly middle-class and Republican-leaning.” That’s changed over the last 20 or so years, however, as the suburbs have become more welcoming <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/120372/white-suburbs-are-more-and-more-thing-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for people of color</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/12/americas-immigrants-are-moving-to-the-suburbs/431748/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigrants</a> — <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both of whom</a> tend to be <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/do-immigrants-make-united-states-more-left-wing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal politically</a>. As a result, on average, the suburbs now lean toward Democrats, leaving some Republicans who live in these areas feeling neglected by the GOP. It’s possible that the GOP may make some inroads in 2022, particularly in counties classified as “mostly suburban,” but those areas have still overwhelmingly moved toward Democrats since 2000.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I definitely feel abandoned by the state party and like they’ve kind of given up on Atlanta,” said Michael A., a 25-year-old who preferred to only use his first name and last initial out of privacy concerns. “For the past few years or so, they’ve stopped talking about issues that matter in the metro area — like how high our taxes are or how the cost of living has gone up dramatically. They’re really focused on the rural areas more now, which I understand, but there are still a lot of Republican voters in my area who feel unheard.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, even though their communities are moving left, some Republicans I spoke with said they’re moving further <em>right</em>. A handful of my interviewees pointed to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-has-and-hasnt-changed-since-george-floyd-was-murdered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests for racial justice</a> in the summer of 2020 following the murder of George Floyd as a turning point. Democratic calls at the time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/defund-police-protests-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to radically shift police policy</a>, including a reduction in police budgets, turned off many Republicans I spoke with.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If I wasn’t conservative before 2020, I would’ve been a hardcore one after that summer,” said Chris Germiller, a 28-year-old from Rockville, Maryland. “For many reasons, that was the worst time of my life due to the constant onslaught of everyone I knew pretending they were a criminologist and prescribing insane policy solutions toward policing. That summer pushed me, emotionally, more to the right.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of Germiller’s frustration likely stems from the fact that, on average, suburban and urban residents <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold more liberal views</a> on issues of racism and racial justice than rural Americans. According to a 2018 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew survey</a>, 69 percent of urban residents and 60 percent of suburban ones (compared to 47 percent of rural dwellers) said they believed that white Americans benefit from certain privileges that Black Americans don’t have. And while many of the Republicans I spoke with said they believe racism still plays a prominent role in today’s society, they didn’t think reducing or eliminating law enforcement was the answer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Ideas like ‘defund the police’ are just crazy to me. Why would you defund the police?” said Liliana S., a 49-year-old Denver, Colorado resident who was born in Venezuela and preferred to only use her first name and last initial out of privacy concerns. “I come from a country where police are not funded and not respected. The result is you get a bunch of mafia and drug lords and common thieves running the country.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, some of the shift to the left on policing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/police-reform-minneapolis-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is overstated</a> and it’s possible that, while these Republicans are outliers in some of their views toward policing, they might have more in common with their liberal neighbors than they realize. For example, prominent leaders in the Democratic Party, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/politics/joe-biden-defund-the-police/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Biden</a>, have emphatically dismissed calls to “defund the police.” Moreover, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-like-the-ideas-behind-defunding-the-police-more-than-the-slogan-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls suggest</a> that voters — regardless of where they live — don’t want to cut funding to police departments. According to a June 2020 <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/06/17/defund-the-police-community-programs-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> survey, less than half of suburban dwellers (43 percent) supported redirecting police funds to communities, while 28 percent were in favor of “defund the police.” A September <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from Pew</a> also showed a significant decline in overall support for cutting police funding. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, “defund the police” has become a motivating issue for Republican voters. This is, in part, because GOP lawmakers have <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-defund-the-police-attacks-democrats-election-2020_n_5fb68698c5b695be83008c57" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capitalized on the movement</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-convinced-crime-is-rising-in-the-u-s-theyre-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successfully tied it to unsubstantiated fears</a> regarding <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/22/1018996709/rising-violent-crime-is-likely-to-present-a-political-challenge-for-democrats-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an increase in violent crime</a> regardless of whether that’s actually happening. In addition, several cities <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/06/18/2020-protests-impact-city-and-state-changes-policing/5337751002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took steps in 2020</a> to change policing that Republicans said rubbed them the wrong way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jonathan M., for example, said he was disappointed when Austin’s City Council voted that year to slash <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/08/13/austin-city-council-cut-police-budget-defund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the city’s police budget</a>, which it was later <a href="https://www.kut.org/austin/2021-08-12/austin-passes-4-5-billion-budget-increases-police-budget-per-state-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced to refund</a> amid pressure <a href="https://www.kut.org/austin/2021-08-11/last-year-austin-cut-its-police-budget-by-millions-a-new-state-law-means-itll-likely-reverse-that-move-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the state’s Republican governor</a>. For a while, though, he claimed that he heard numerous stories from neighbors who were robbed or burglarized, but who were still hesitant to call the police for assistance. “Some people are against calling the cops because they think it will result in escalation of the issue,” he said. “I disagree, of course, but knowing how my neighbors feel about these things makes me more reserved, and I try to keep a distance from those conversations.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This has exacerbated a belief among people I spoke with that Democrats (and, in turn, their respective cities) have moved <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even further to the left</a>, specifically on issues related to race and public safety. And many of the Republicans I talked to say they no longer feel like they can have constructive conversations with their neighbors and coworkers about policies they disagree on — a sentiment that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-it-like-being-a-democrat-in-trump-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats living in rural areas of the U.S. felt</a>, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s tough to grow a friend circle. Admittedly, I’m a bit of an introvert to begin with, but even at work, it’s tough to talk about anything other than shop because this is a left-leaning area,” Charlie C., the conservative voter in Minnesota, said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even though Republicans like Charlie C. might feel like outsiders now, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-2022-be-a-good-year-for-republicans-yes-we-know-its-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are signs</a> that 2022 will likely be a good year for Republicans nationally. And because some of the areas my interviewees lived in aren’t as blue <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-it-like-being-a-democrat-in-trump-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as some rural areas are red</a>, it’s possible these Republicans will even see some political changes in their areas, especially those in more suburban or exurban areas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You know, even if the Republican Party isn’t going to win Fulton County anytime soon, there are hundreds of thousands of Republican voters in urban areas and if you get them excited, they’re going to put you over the finish line,” said Michael A., who noted that he’s seen a handful of bumper stickers for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in recent weeks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, 2022 offers prime pick-up opportunities for Republicans: According to our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot average</a>, which tracks which party people plan to vote for in the upcoming congressional election — Republicans currently lead Democrats by about 2 percentage points. Moreover, since much of the previous suburban <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/27/668726284/where-the-suburbs-moved-left-and-how-it-swung-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shift toward Democrats in 2018</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/07/suburban-voters-got-behind-trumps-message-2016-now-they-are-walking-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 appears to have been driven</a> by disdain for Trump, it’s not clear whether these gains will hold without him on the ballot. This is evident in <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling from Reuters/Ipsos</a> which has found that Biden is struggling to hold suburban voters since coming into office last year: Only 44 percent said they approve of his job as president as of last week — down nearly 7 points since around this time last year.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Without Trump on the ballot, Biden might lose ground in suburbs" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/81vnE/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="602" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Polling from <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/January-2022_HHP_Crosstab.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll</a> released in January tells a similar story. It found that 57 percent of suburban respondents were more likely to vote for a Republican candidate in the midterms, versus 43 percent who said they’d be more likely to vote for a Democratic one. What’s also working in the GOP’s favor is that the party so far has capitalized on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/schoolhouse-culture-wars-factor-2022-midterms/story?id=83343766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an enticing pitch</a> to rile up voters: highlighting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-keep-losing-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">culture war issues</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-really-really-dislike-biden-but-its-not-just-about-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad disapproval with the Biden administration</a>. On top of that, Glenn Youngkin’s win in Virginia last year suggests that it’s possible for certain Republicans to win competitive states — including parts of the suburbs — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/trump-republican-governor-race-glenn-youngkin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the right roadmap</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means Republicans in blue cities and suburbs might have reason to be optimistic for November, especially since 2022 will likely serve as a test of sorts for how durable suburban gains have been and whether we’ll see a lurch back to the right. Of course, that won’t change the makeup of some very urban areas that have voted solidly Democratic for the last two decades or so, but it does mean that some of these Republicans might not be the outliers that they think they are. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Charlie C. put it plainly: “It’s less that the GOP has abandoned [my] area, and more that they are out-gunned. They don’t have the ability to mobilize in every district,” he said. “I realize I am in enemy territory. I’m just hoping to be able to minimize some of the damage.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Five years ago, Emmanuel Macron <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39839349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a sweeping victory</a> to become the youngest president in France’s history. Running at the head of The Republic On The Move,<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La République En Marche! in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> a <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/02/06/emmanuel-macron-liberal-centrist-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centrist and pro-European Union party</a> he had founded <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/04/06/emmanuel-macron-lance-un-mouvement-politique-nouveau-baptise-en-marche_4897274_823448.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2016</a>, Macron defeated his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen, by more than 30 percentage points and <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/10/france-mainstream-parties-survival-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke the hold</a> of the traditional center-right and center-left parties over French politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as France prepares for the first round of presidential voting on Sunday, Macron is fighting to maintain his centrist coalition in the face of more radical alternatives. Not totally unlike the United States and other parts of Europe, France has experienced <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/europe/2022/03/29/fractured-france" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep political cleavages</a> between its urban and rural, affluent and working class and native and immigrant populations. And a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/magazine/new-french-right.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burgeoning political right</a> has stoked anti-immigrant and nationalist sentiment in the <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/eps/6073?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethnically and culturally diverse</a> country. Add in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/people-feel-suffocated-cost-of-living-tops-french-concerns-before-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns about the cost of living</a>, and it’s no wonder Macron faces a tough reelection battle. Once again, it’s Le Pen who looks most likely to stand in his way, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Based on <a href="https://github.com/nsppolls/nsppolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey data collected</a> by French journalist Alexandre Léchenet, Macron and Le Pen hold strong leads over the rest of the field in Sunday’s first-round vote, with Macron leading the field at a bit north of 25 percent, on average, and Le Pen in second in the low 20s. Only one other candidate, far-left contender Jean-Luc Mélenchon, is polling above 10 percent.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Macron and Le Pen are the two candidates likeliest to advance" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DXmjZ/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">However, as no candidate is polling anywhere near 50 percent, a runoff election between the top two vote-getters on April 24 is a near certainty at this point, as a candidate must secure a majority of the vote in order to win on Sunday. Those two candidates are very likely to be Macron and Le Pen. <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/france-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist’s forecast</a> currently gives Macron and Le Pen a 98 percent and 93 percent chance of advancing to the runoff, respectively. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s troubling for Macron, though, is that Le Pen’s gains suggest she could pose a real threat in the runoff, as she has consolidated support on the political right while her two main rivals, Valérie Pécresse and Éric Zemmour, have lost ground. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Le Pen and her party, the National Rally<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rassemblement National in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> (formerly the National Front), have <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9aebdp/a-history-of-the-national-front" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditionally run on</a> an anti-immigrant and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Euroskepticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Euroskeptic</a> platform, dating back to her father <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Marie-Le-Pen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>’s party leadership. But in this election, Le Pen has placed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cost-living-woes-boost-phoenix-le-pen-race-french-presidency-2022-03-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater emphasis on kitchen table issues</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-immigration-business-migration-presidential-elections-1b63d3f94583427ad570588564d46061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including calls</a> to cut taxes on energy and raise base pensions, which may broaden her appeal considering that many in France <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/france-macron-vows-inflation-relief-at-election-rally/a-61339459" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are worried about inflation</a>. To be sure, her party maintains a strong anti-immigrant platform that aims to weaken immigrants’ access to government benefits and shut out many asylum seekers, but Le Pen <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/99f9e50b-1134-4af2-b85c-831c0e325157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has welcomed Ukrainian refugees</a> as she tries to distance herself from <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220304-ukraine-war-puts-france-s-nato-sceptic-presidential-candidates-in-a-tight-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her past praise</a> of Russian President Vladimir Putin. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Le Pen’s hard-right edge may have also been softened in voters’ eyes given Zemmour’s far-right campaign. A <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/marine-le-pen-and-eric-zemmour-je-taime-moi-non-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political commentator</a> who has <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/10/france-eric-zemmour-president-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">espoused racist, anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic views</a> and been <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/frances-eric-zemmour-announces-presidential-candidacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convicted twice of inciting hatred,</a> Zemmour seemed to initially <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take a bite out of Le Pen’s support</a> last fall, but his campaign never quite took off, and he has since slipped in the polls. Meanwhile, Le Pen may also be winning over some conservative voters who <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/valerie-pecresse-macron-hard-right-french-election-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoned Pécresse</a> and her center-right party, The Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Les Républicains in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the French left, which has been in a <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/14/france-macron-left-election-socialist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state of disarray</a> in recent years, hasn’t yet consolidated around Macron. Instead, Mélenchon of the France Unbowed party<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La France Insoumise in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> has been gaining ground in the polls. Mélenchon may be gaining traction for his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/world/europe/melenchon-france-election-left.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign promises</a> to reintroduce a wealth tax that ended during Macron’s administration and lower the retirement age from 62 to 60. Then again, Mélenchon is still polling considerably behind both Le Pen and Macron, so his campaign might be most significant for whether Macron can win over many of Mélenchon’s voters in a runoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Until a few weeks ago, though, Macron didn’t look like he was in trouble. In fact, his handling of the war in Ukraine had significantly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/05/france-election-macron-le-pen-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted his standing</a> at home. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Macron’s first-round polling numbers jumped from the mid-20s to around 30 percent, as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/world/europe/macron-france-russia-ukraine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned plaudits for his diplomatic efforts</a> to halt the Russian invasion, and when that failed, praise for his tough stance toward Russia both militarily and economically. Tellingly, his numbers hit 60 percent in some head-to-head surveys against Le Pen ahead of a possible runoff. However, as the war in Ukraine has dragged on, Macron’s bump has dissipated — in fact, he’s slipped below where he was prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as the chart below shows.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Macron now holds only a narrow lead over Le Pen in runoff polls" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/44o8K/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="475" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s not really clear why Macron’s numbers have dropped so dramatically, as he still enjoys relatively high support for his handling of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-03-12/france-macron-russia-putin-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign policy</a>. Part of it could have to do with low marks for his <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220311-trickle-down-in-drips-and-drops-the-french-economy-after-five-years-under-macron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempts to liberalize France’s economy</a>, including making it easier for companies to lay off workers and lowering business taxes, which <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220323-yellow-vest-protests-covid-19-stymied-macron-s-plans-for-social-welfare-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t been popular</a>. Some critics have called him “the candidate of the rich,” and moves like getting rid of the wealth tax and reducing social spending assistance have played into that. And Macron’s policies have resulted in populist outcry before, as a proposed gas tax hike in 2018 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/03/672862353/who-are-frances-yellow-vest-protesters-and-what-do-they-want" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led to nationwide protests</a> in what became known as the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220401-will-france-s-yellow-vests-come-back-to-haunt-macron-on-election-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yellow Vest Movement</a>. Now his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-oppose-macrons-proposed-later-retirement-poll-shows-election-looms-2022-04-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign is pushing the unpopular position</a> of raising the retirement age, which may also explain why the race between him and Le Pen has narrowed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, polling between Macron and Le Pen has gotten close enough that Le Pen is just a normal polling error away from winning: <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/macron-won-but-the-french-polls-were-way-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The average error</a> between the poll margin two weeks before the election and the runoff result has been about 4.6 points in French presidential elections from 1969 to 2017, and polling averages produced by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico</a> and <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/FRANCE-ELECTION/POLLS/zjvqkomzlvx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> each put Macron’s runoff lead at 6 points. In other words, a slightly larger-than-normal error could make Le Pen France’s next president. And there’s still time for the race to tighten further, as the likely runoff will take place two weeks after the first round.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, we should be careful about interpreting just how close the margin is because French polling doesn’t include undecided voters, who may or may not vote. For instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/electo_mania/status/1512102062280036361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos’s latest tracking poll</a> of the likely Macron-Le Pen runoff found that about 1 in 5 first-round voters wouldn’t cast a vote. This was an issue in 2017, too, <a href="http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/FRANCE-ELECTION/010040SZ1RE/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as turnout fell in the second round</a>, and it could continue to be one in the 2022 runoff because some voters, particularly those on the left, may not be particularly enthused about either candidate. To be sure, what happened in 2017 wasn’t the norm; voter participation has usually risen at least a little bit in presidential runoffs. But many voters <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-election-president-2022-abstention-what-if-nobody-came/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may not cast a ballot at all</a> this year, which could endanger Macron if the political right is more energized to vote than the center.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bottom line: The French presidential election looks to be much closer now than it did a couple of weeks ago. The Economist’s model had put Macron’s reelection chances north of 90 percent in late March; now his odds of winning are slightly better than 3 in 4. Macron is still the clear favorite, but tightening polls have raised the prospect that he will lose the runoff if things go Le Pen’s way.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The share of Americans who say they are worried a great deal about the environment <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391547/seven-year-stretch-elevated-environmental-concern.aspx">has remained elevated for the last seven years</a>, according to a March 1-18 poll from Gallup. Forty-four percent of respondents said they worried about the quality of the environment a great deal, down only slightly from highs of 47 percent in 2017 and 2019. When asked about specific environmental problems, the greatest share of respondents said they were worried about pollution of drinking water (57 percent), while the smallest share of respondents listed global warming or climate change (43 percent) as their top concern.</li><li><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/poll-63-of-americans-say-putin-cannot-remain-in-power-090049601.html">Most Americans agree with the sentiment</a> that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power — but that doesn’t mean they approve of President Biden having said it <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-transcript-president-bidens-speech-warsaw-russias-invasion/story?id=83690301">in a March 26 speech in Warsaw</a>, according to a March 31-April 4 poll from Yahoo News/YouGov. When the quote about Putin — “This man cannot remain in power” — was unattributed, 63 percent agreed with it. But when the pollster asked whether Biden was right or wrong to have said it,” just 48 percent of Americans said he was right. Both Democrats and Republicans were less likely to agree with this statement when it was attributed to Biden: 57 percent of Republicans agreed with the unattributed statement, whereas only 37 percent said the same when told Biden said it; meanwhile, 83 percent of Democrats agreed with the unattributed statement, while 70 percent said the same when told Biden said it.</li><li><a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/06/autonomous-vehicles-safety-and-trust/">Trust in autonomous vehicles (also known as self-driving cars) remains low.</a> In fact, the share of Americans who say that they trust autonomous vehicles to be safer than traditional cars has gone down since 2018.

Overall, 78 percent agreed that social media companies have the right to remove any person considered to violate the platform’s terms of service and 72 percent agreed that social media companies had the right to block any post they considered inappropriate. Large majorities also said they supported social media companies removing posts that probably have false information (75 percent), promote violence against particular individuals or groups (80 percent) or pose a risk to the public (79 percent). But at the same time, 69 percent of respondents agreed that companies have a clear political agenda in who and what they block. Just 48 percent of respondents said they support removing posts that promote political action and 54 percent said the same of posts that have heated political language.</li><li><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/04/05/trust-media-2022-where-americans-get-news-poll">The Weather Channel is the most trusted media organization in the U.S.</a>, with a net rating of +41 points among American adults; the least trusted outlet is Breitbart, with a net rating of -15 points, according to a March 26-29 poll from The Economist/YouGov that asked about 22 different media organizations. Opinions of CNN were the most politically polarized: 66 percent of Democrats said it was very or somewhat trustworthy, versus just 11 percent of Republicans. On the whole, though, Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to trust media outlets. There were only two outlets (Fox News at 53 percent and The Weather Channel at 50 percent) that the majority of Republicans trusted, versus 14<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weather Channel, PBS, the BBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, NPR, the Associated Press, TIME Magazine and MSNBC.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">Should marijuana be legal in the United States? Over the past 20 years, Americans’ have reversed their views on that question to a degree rarely seen in politics. In 2001, 34 percent of Americans said yes, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1657/illegal-drugs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Gallup</a>. Today it’s 68 percent. A breadth of polling suggests a majority of Americans now favor either <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-55-americans-favor-decriminalizing-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decriminalizing <em>all</em> drug use</a> or significantly <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2016/02/12/voters-want-changes-in-federal-sentencing-prison-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changing the punishment for it</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While there has been some <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/gop-support-clears-senate-path-for-bill-on-cocaine-sentencing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan movement</a> on the issue, politicians don’t seem to be walking entirely in step with Americans. As Congress considers legislation that would decriminalize marijuana and end the sentencing disparity for crack and cocaine offenses, Galen Druke speaks with FiveThirtyEight contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/leddder?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lester Black</a> about what Americans think should be done about drugs and how politicians are responding.</p>
